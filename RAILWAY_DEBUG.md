# üö® Railway Backend Not Responding - DEBUG GUIDE

## ‚ùå Current Status
```
Backend URL: https://youtube-topic-analyzer-production.up.railway.app
Status: 502 - Application failed to respond
Issue: Backend is NOT running!
```

---

## üîç Step 1: Check Railway Dashboard

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard:**
   https://railway.app/dashboard

2. **Find your backend project**

3. **Check "Deployments" tab:**
   - Is there a new deployment from GitHub?
   - What's the status? (Building, Deploying, Success, Failed?)
   - If FAILED - click to see error logs

4. **If no new deployment:**
   - Railway might not be connected to GitHub
   - You may need to manually trigger a deploy

---

## üîç Step 2: Check Railway Logs

In your Railway project:

1. Click **"View Logs"**
2. Look for:
   ```
   ‚ùå ERROR: Missing environment variable
   ‚ùå ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi'
   ‚ùå Connection error
   ```

Common errors:
- **Missing API keys** ‚Üí Set environment variables
- **Module errors** ‚Üí Check requirements.txt
- **Port binding errors** ‚Üí Railway should auto-set PORT

---

## üîç Step 3: Verify Environment Variables

Railway MUST have these environment variables:

1. **Go to your Railway project**
2. **Click "Variables" tab**
3. **Check these are set:**

```
OPENAI_API_KEY = sk-proj-...
YOUTUBE_API_KEY = AIza...
PORT = (auto-set by Railway)
```

**If missing:**
1. Click "+ New Variable"
2. Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your key
3. Add `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` with your key
4. Save and redeploy

---

## üîç Step 4: Check Railway is Connected to GitHub

1. **In Railway project settings:**
2. **Check "Source" section**
3. **Should show:**
   ```
   Source: GitHub
   Repository: guptanoor1306/youtube-topic-analyzer
   Branch: main
   Root Directory: backend
   ```

**If not connected:**
1. Click "Connect Repo"
2. Select your GitHub repo
3. Set **Root Directory: backend** (IMPORTANT!)
4. Deploy

---

## üöÄ Manual Redeploy (If Needed)

If Railway didn't auto-deploy:

1. **Go to your Railway project**
2. **Click "Deployments"**
3. **Click "Deploy" button**
4. **Wait 2-3 minutes for build**
5. **Check logs for success**

---

## ‚úÖ What Success Looks Like

**In Railway Logs, you should see:**
```
‚úÖ INFO: Application startup complete
‚úÖ INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:PORT
‚úÖ INFO: Started server process
```

**Health check should work:**
```bash
curl https://youtube-topic-analyzer-production.up.railway.app/health
# Returns: {"status":"healthy","service":"YouTube Topic Analyzer API"}
```
