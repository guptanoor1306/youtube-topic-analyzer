# 🎯 Quick Start: Niche Channel Search

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

I've added a complete **Niche Channel Management System** that allows you to:
1. Define 100 channels in your niche
2. Search for titles ONLY within those channels
3. Get highly relevant, niche-specific results

---

## 🚀 How to Set Up (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Add Your Niche Channels

Edit this file: `backend/niche_channels.json`

```json
{
  "niche_name": "Your Niche (e.g., Finance & Business)",
  "description": "Description of your niche",
  "channels": [
    {
      "channel_id": "@ChannelUsername",
      "channel_name": "Display Name",
      "category": "Subcategory"
    },
    // Add 100 channels like this
  ]
}
```

**Finding Channel IDs:**
- Go to any YouTube channel
- Look at URL: `youtube.com/@Username`
- Use `@Username` as the `channel_id`
- OR use the full channel ID from the "About" tab

### Step 2: Restart Backend (if running)

```bash
# Kill and restart
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
python main.py
```

### Step 3: Use It!

1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Complete topic analysis
3. Go to Title Generation
4. **Click "🎯 Search Within My Niche"**
5. Get results from YOUR channels only!

## 🎯 Example Setup

Here's how to set up a Finance niche:

```json
{
  "niche_name": "Finance & Business",
  "description": "Personal finance, investing, business",
  "channels": [
    {"channel_id": "@GrahamStephan", "channel_name": "Graham Stephan", "category": "Personal Finance"},
    {"channel_id": "@AndreiJikh", "channel_name": "Andrei Jikh", "category": "Investing"},
    {"channel_id": "@MeetKevin", "channel_name": "Meet Kevin", "category": "Real Estate"},
    {"channel_id": "@ThePlainBagel", "channel_name": "The Plain Bagel", "category": "Education"},
    {"channel_id": "@BeatTheBush", "channel_name": "BeatTheBush", "category": "Frugal Living"},
    // ... add 95 more channels in your finance niche
  ]
}
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Start with 20-30 Channels
Don't need all 100 immediately. Start small, test, then add more.

### 2. Mix Channel Sizes
- 20 big channels (1M+ subs)
- 30 medium channels (100K-1M)
- 30 growing channels (10K-100K)
- 20 emerging channels (<10K)

### 3. Organize by Category
Makes it easier to manage and future features will use categories.

### 4. Quality Over Quantity
50 highly relevant channels > 100 random ones
