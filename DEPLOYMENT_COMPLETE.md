---

## 🧪 How to Test

### 1. Open the App
Visit: https://youtube-topic-analyzer.vercel.app

### 2. Wait for Channel Load
- You'll see "Zero1 by Zerodha" load automatically
- Green checkmark when ready
- Shows "20 videos loaded"

### 3. Click Zero1 Circle
- Blue/purple gradient circle in center
- Opens video selection page

### 4. Select Videos (IMPORTANT!)
- ✅ **Select 3-5 videos** (recommended)
- ⚠️ **Do NOT select 10+ videos** (will timeout)
- Videos sorted by view count

### 5. Enter Your Prompt
Example prompts:
```
"Suggest 5 video topics similar to these, focused on beginner financial education"

"Based on these videos, what series can I create for millennials?"

"Analyze the themes in these videos and suggest 3 follow-up topics"
```

### 6. Generate Suggestions
- Click "Generate Suggestions"
- Wait 15-30 seconds (depending on # of videos)
- AI analyzes transcripts + comments

### 7. Review Results
- Series suggestions with episodes
- Additional topic ideas
- Content gaps identified
- Use follow-up chat to refine

---

## ⚠️ Important Usage Notes

### Video Selection Limits
- **3 videos** = ~15 seconds ✅ Fast & safe
- **5 videos** = ~25 seconds ✅ Recommended
- **7 videos** = ~40 seconds ⚠️ Might timeout
- **10+ videos** = ❌ Will timeout on Railway free tier

### Why the Limit?
Each video requires:
- YouTube API: Fetch transcript (~2s)
- YouTube API: Fetch comments (~2s)  
- OpenAI: Analyze content (~5-10s per video)

**10 videos = 100+ seconds → Railway timeout!**

### Best Practice
Start with **3 videos** to test, then gradually increase to find your sweet spot (usually 5-7 max).
