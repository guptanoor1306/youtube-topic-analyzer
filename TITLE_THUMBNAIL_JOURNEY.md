## Backend API Endpoints

### 1. Search Similar Titles
```python
POST /api/search-similar-titles
{
  "topic": "string",
  "max_results": 20  # optional
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "topic": "string",
  "videos": [
    {
      "video_id": "string",
      "title": "string",
      "channel_name": "string",
      "thumbnail": "string",
      "view_count": 1234567,
      "duration_minutes": 15.5,
      "published_at": "string"
    }
  ],
  "count": 20
}
```

**How it works:**
- Searches YouTube for the topic

## Design Decisions

### Why Filter for Long-Form Content?
- Long-form videos (>10 minutes) typically have:
  - More established channels
  - Better production quality
  - Proven title effectiveness
  - Higher engagement

### Why Top 20 by Views?
- View count is the best proxy for title effectiveness
- 20 provides good variety without overwhelming
- Sorted by performance = learning from success

### Why Select 5 Thumbnails?
- Provides enough variety for AI to understand style
- Not too many to dilute the reference style
- Sweet spot for context vs. focus

### Why DALL-E 3?
- Best-in-class image generation
- Understands complex prompts
- Optimized for specific dimensions
- High quality output
- Built-in safety features

## Usage Tips

### For Best Title Results:
1. Use specific, descriptive topics
2. Include keywords your audience searches for
3. Review multiple options before selecting

### For Best Thumbnail Results:
1. Select thumbnails with similar style/theme
2. Be specific in your prompt:
   - Colors: "bright blue and yellow"
   - Text: "Large text saying 'SAVE MONEY'"
   - Emotions: "excited person pointing"
   - Elements: "money symbols, graphs"
3. Reference successful patterns from selected thumbnails
4. Include your branding requirements

## Example Workflow

```
1. User completes topic analysis
   → Gets 5 series suggestions

2. Clicks "Generate Titles & Thumbnails"
   → Opens Topic Selection

3. Selects "Building a Dividend Portfolio for Passive Income"
   → Continues to Title Generation

4. System searches YouTube
   → Shows 20 high-performing titles about dividend investing

5. User reviews titles, selects:
   "How I Built a $10,000/Month Dividend Portfolio from Scratch"

6. Continues to Thumbnail Generation
   → Sees 20 thumbnails from those videos

7. Selects 5 thumbnails with:
   - Bold text overlays
   - Green/gold money themes
   - Excited presenters

8. Enters prompt:
   "Large bold text saying '$10K MONTHLY', person pointing at dividend chart,
   excited expression, green and gold color scheme, money symbols floating"

9. Clicks Generate
   → AI creates custom thumbnail

10. Downloads thumbnail
    → Ready to upload video!
```

## Cost Considerations

### YouTube API
- Each title search uses ~2-3 API calls
- Well within free tier quota
- Cached results for efficiency

### OpenAI API
- DALL-E 3 Standard: ~$0.04 per image
- Worth it for custom, professional thumbnails
- Much cheaper than hiring a designer

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Features:
1. **A/B Testing Suggestions**
   - Generate multiple title variations
   - Thumbnail variants for testing

2. **Title Analysis**
   - Keyword density
   - Emotional triggers
   - Length optimization

3. **Thumbnail Templates**
   - Pre-defined styles
   - Brand consistency tools

4. **Batch Generation**
   - Multiple titles/thumbnails at once
   - Series consistency

5. **Performance Tracking**
   - Save used titles/thumbnails
   - Track actual performance
   - Learn from your data

## Technical Notes

### Performance
- Title search: ~2-5 seconds
- Thumbnail generation: ~10-15 seconds (DALL-E 3)
- All API calls are asynchronous
- Proper loading states throughout

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallbacks for API failures
- User-friendly error messages
- Retry options where appropriate
- Validation before expensive operations

### State Management
- Uses React's built-in state
- Persistent across route navigation
- Cleanup on app restart

## Troubleshooting

### "No topics found in results"
- Make sure you completed topic analysis first
- Check that results contain valid data

### "No title suggestions found"
- Topic might be too specific/niche
- Try broader search terms
- Check YouTube API quota

### "Failed to generate thumbnail"
- Check OpenAI API key
- Verify API quota/billing
- Review prompt for policy violations
- Try simpler prompt

### Thumbnail not downloading
- Check popup blocker settings
