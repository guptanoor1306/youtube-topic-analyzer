00:20 lakhs is not just numbers on a screen it's a moment that transforms your thinking so when you get there you feel a surge of confidence Time: 00:20 - 00:30 and now you have hardcore proof a whole 10 lakhs of it to know what's achievable and that propels you forward to even greater Milestones it's much like the story of the 4minute mile so back in the Time: 00:30 - 00:40 1950s running one mile that is 1.6 km in under 4 minutes was considered Time: 00:40 - 00:50 impossible but then in 1954 Roger banister changed everything when he ran a mile in 3 minutes and 59.4 Time: 00:50 - 01:00 seconds and what happened next is even more fascinating within just 46 days of bannister's record Another Runner John ly shattered the 4minute mark running it Time: 01:00 - 01:10 this time in 3 minutes and 57.9 seconds and then in another year three more Runners broke the 4minute barrier in one Time: 01:10 - 01:20 single race and today thousands of athletes have run a mile in less than 4 minutes this shift wasn't just physical it was also psychological Time: 01:20 - 01:30 once banister showed that it could be done the collective belief absolutely changed the mental barrier had been broken and what was once thought to be impossible became not just possible but Time: 01:30 - 01:40 almost routine it's a very powerful reminder of how our mindset either holds us back or launches us forward to Time: 01:40 - 01:50 achieve what we once thought was Out Of Reach and in his book The Winner effect Ian Robertson says that winning rewies the brain creating a neurochemical Time: 01:50 - 02:00 Cascade that alters Behavior motivation and future success so it's like a cycle one win right just one win makes the next win even more likely and that's the Time: 02:00 - 02:10 magic of that first 10 lakhs it's not just about the money it's about the psychological breakthrough and the momentum that it creates setting you up Time: 02:10 - 02:20 for bigger and better wins in the future success breeds success and with 10 lakhs you're just getting started I vividly remember the moment I hit my first 10 Time: 02:20 - 02:30 lakhs I'd been stuck around 7 s and a half lakhs for some time and finally reaching 10 lakhs felt like a major victory it was a moment filled with a Time: 02:30 - 02:40 deep sense of satisfaction and knowing that my efforts and discipline had paid off it made me think B I had proven to Time: 02:40 - 02:50 myself that I had What It Takes hi if you want to apply what I share here on YouTube to your life then check out my complete guide to mutual fund investing Time: 02:50 - 03:00 it has all my years of experience of being licensed in Indian Financial Services since 2015 and in it I have covered topics like how to select mutual funds how to build your mutual fund Time: 03:00 - 03:10 portfolio and how to plan for your various goals amongst other subjects like deep dives into sips and even s swps this guide also has many Excel tools like a mutual fund selector and a Time: 03:10 - 03:20 master Financial goal sheet where you just enter your goal the money required and when you need it and it automatically tells you how much you need to invest and where factoring in Time: 03:20 - 03:30 inflation and even a stepup sip and once you sign up for the guide you'll also be part of my live monthly Q&A sessions where I answer all your doubts to buy Time: 03:30 - 03:40 the guide check out the first link in the description and the pin comment and now let's go back to the video then comes the second game changer protection Time: 03:40 - 03:50 from Big Financial shocks so when you have saved your first 10 lakhs you reach a point where no one single major expense is likely to Dent your finan es Time: 03:50 - 04:00 because think about it what was the biggest emergency expense you have had in the past few years chances are it cost absolutely nowhere near 10 lakhs so with 10 lakhs saved you have the peace Time: 04:00 - 04:10 of mind that significant and unexpected expenses like last minute flights for family emergencies urgent home repairs or unexpected medical costs not covered Time: 04:10 - 04:20 by insurance won't throw your financial plan off track plus having 10 lakhs likely means you have already taken care of essential precau ctions like getting Time: 04:20 - 04:30 a term insurance policy and a private health insurance plan outside of what your employer offers and these safety nets ensure that some of your life's worst case Financial scenarios are Time: 04:30 - 04:40 already covered for and even if you haven't got a health or term insurance yet having that 10 lakhs cushion gives you the financial ability to literally Time: 04:40 - 04:50 go out and get them right now without worrying about their cost just to give you an idea a 1 health insurance plan through a super topup will cost about Time: 04:50 - 05:00 15,000 rupees for a 25y old and about 20,000 rupees for a 35y old while a basic onek term plan will cost about 9,000 and 13,000 per year so having 10 Time: 05:00 - 05:10 lakhs is a very solid foundation to always cap your downside which is very very important in his book winning the Time: 05:10 - 05:20 losers game Charles Ellis lays out a principle that is critical for financial success he describes investing as a losers game but what does he mean by Time: 05:20 - 05:30 that Ellis shares that winning with money isn't about pulling off dazzling victories or scoring huge wins instead it's about consistently avoiding major Time: 05:30 - 05:40 setbacks that can wipe out years of hard work on the other hand in professional sports you need big wins or a great skill set to eventually come out Time: 05:40 - 05:50 Victorious that's why Sports is a winners game so picture Champions like Roger feder or vat kohle they win with breathtaking shots the kind of forehand Time: 05:50 - 06:00 that leaves the crowd in awe or a cover Drive of kohi that is pure perfection so you need a worldclass skill set in sports to win but in investing the Time: 06:00 - 06:10 player who makes fewer mistakes and errors usually comes out on top and that's why Ellis calls investing a losers game when it comes to money most Time: 06:10 - 06:20 people fantasize about hitting a jackpot with an investment a stock that will make them coros overnight but in reality those big wins are unpredictable and Time: 06:20 - 06:30 rare the real key to financial success as I said is avoiding major setbacks like accumulating massive debt suffering significant investment losses or just Time: 06:30 - 06:40 being unprepared for the emergencies that life throws our way so having 10 lakh saved up acts as a shield protecting you from financial disasters that could derail your future so if you Time: 06:40 - 06:50 didn't have this money saved and you faced an emergency expense of say 2 lakh rupees you'd be forced to take a high interest personal loan or a credit card Time: 06:50 - 07:00 loan and let me break down these numbers for you if you had to take a 2 lakh personal loan at a 15% interest for 5 years your Emi would be about 4758 rupees per month over 5 years You' end Time: 07:00 - 07:10 up paying a total of 2.85 lakhs that's a massive extra 85,000 rupees just in interest now imagine if you hadn't taken Time: 07:10 - 07:20 that loan and instead invested that 4758 rupees every single month and you got an annual return of 12% now now in 5 years Time: 07:20 - 07:30 your investment would have grown to 3.77 lakhs that's the power right that's the power of avoiding debt and investing wisely which brings me to reason number Time: 07:30 - 07:40 three I'm not saying that having 10 lakhs will give you complete Financial Freedom but it sets the stage for something equally powerful momentum it's Time: 07:40 - 07:50 like giving a strong push to a flywheel and once it gets going it becomes Unstoppable here's why when you have saved up 10 lakhs even a modest 10% Time: 07:50 - 08:00 annual return adds 1 lakh Rupees to your portfolio and that effort required to achieve a 10% return on 10 lakhs is the same effort required to get a 10% return Time: 08:00 - 08:10 on 1 lakh but because you have a higher invested amount your money grows faster it's like doing the same amount of work Time: 08:10 - 08:20 but getting 10 times the payoff just because you started off with a larger base so not only does your wealth grow but it does so at an accelerating rate or thanks to the power of compounding Time: 08:20 - 08:30 plus with 10 lakhs and your basic emergencies covered you're now in a prime position to focus on your long-term Investments so let me put this in perspective if you have a 10 lakh Time: 08:30 - 08:40 base and invest 10,000 per month through an sip your wealth grows exponentially you'd reach 25 lakhs in your fifth year 50 lakhs in your 9th year and then Time: 08:40 - 08:50 instead of it taking 18 years to hit 1 CR you would reach there in a little over 13 years now that's a relatively low sip of 10,000 rupees per month but Time: 08:50 - 09:00 realistically if you already have a 10 lakh base you're likely to invest much more say 20 or 25,000 rupees per month so with a 25,000 sip you could hit the 1 Time: 09:00 - 09:10 CR milestone in just 10 years and for this I've assumed a 7% annual step up and a 12% annual return now pair this Time: 09:10 - 09:20 financial momentum with the first reason that we discussed of breaking past a mental barrier so first you witness the power of actually seeing 10 lakhs that you have saved up and then you Time: 09:20 - 09:30 experience the magic of compounding as your money starts making money it's not just inspiring it's lifechanging when you actually see it happen and this Time: 09:30 - 09:40 realization will automatically make you more committed and serious about how you invest and manage your money it's like a light bulb moment where you truly grasp Time: 09:40 - 09:50 how wealth is built over time then reason number four it's the grind right it's the grind that builds you hitting the 10 lakh Milestone is more more than just a financial achievement it's a Time: 09:50 - 10:00 testimony to your resilience and the good money habits that you have cultivated along the way you have not only earned a decent amount of money but more importantly you have made the Time: 10:00 - 10:10 disciplined choice to save a significant portion of it and that grind right all the choices you make the Journey of balancing earning and saving that Time: 10:10 - 10:20 transforms You by this point you have likely outgrown bad money Habits Like overspending or getting swept up in fomo which is the fear of missing out you have replaced them instead with Time: 10:20 - 10:30 behaviors that build wealth like budgeting prioritizing your expenses getting insurance and staying focused on your long-term goals and this is true no matter what your age is if you are young Time: 10:30 - 10:40 and manage to save 10 lakhs you have set up a foundation for your money to compound and work for you over time but if you're older reaching 10 lakhs means Time: 10:40 - 10:50 you have likely weathered very severe hardships and have fought through adversity to save that amount and that struggle has given you a deeper Time: 10:50 - 11:00 appreciation for what you've achieved I truly believe that making money is a result of consistent action and hard work sure luck does play a part but as Time: 11:00 - 11:10 Hara B wisely said luck is opportunity meeting preparedness so unless you've put in those long and hard hours you won't be ready to seize an opportunity Time: 11:10 - 11:20 when it comes knocking reaching your first 10 lakhs is all about experiencing the importance of discipline and the power of delayed Gra ratification it Time: 11:20 - 11:30 reminds me of a quote by JP Morgan it goes something like if you were to redistribute all the money in the world equally amongst all people it would very soon find its way back to the people who Time: 11:30 - 11:40 originally had it and finally reason number five is that you're no longer going to be in survival mode having 10 lakhs saved up doesn't just give you Time: 11:40 - 11:50 Financial Security it gives you options and having options that is true power it means you can walk away from situations that no longer serve you or don't align Time: 11:50 - 12:00 with your values also when you have 10 lakhs saved up the impact on your spending habits and peace of mind is truly life-altering the guilt or anxiety Time: 12:00 - 12:10 you usually experience when making a purchase like let's say spending an extra 1,000 rupees on a dinner or booking a spontaneous weekend getaway the anxiety of all of this significantly Time: 12:10 - 12:20 reduces once you get to a certain amount of financial safety and you can truly enjoy these moments even more guilt-free it's of course not about becoming a Time: 12:20 - 12:30 reckless spender rather it's about having the freedom to occasionally indulge without feeling like you're compromising on your future security and Time: 12:30 - 12:40 when it comes to facing something as serious as let's say a job loss having 10 lakhs saved up is a complete GameChanger once again because losing a job is obviously one of life's biggest Time: 12:40 - 12:50 stressors and it often leads to a whirlwind of panic and uncertainty without a financial cushion you might feel compelled to immediately accept any job offer even if it's far from ideal Time: 12:50 - 13:00 just to keep your head above the water but with a solid 10 lakh safety net you are no longer in a race against the clock this buffer gives you breathing Time: 13:00 - 13:10 room to consider roles that will genuinely fulfill you or even give you the freedom to pivet into a new industry learn new skills or even take time to Time: 13:10 - 13:20 upskill yourself without Financial strain all this while you won't be worried about paying rent taking care of family expenses or simply sustaining Time: 13:20 - 13:30 day-to-day living so where are you in the Journey of your first 10 lakhs tell me in the comments and if you like this video then check this one out where I talk about s swps that are systematic Time: 13:30 - 13:40 withdrawal plans which is a way to generate regular income from your Mutual finds and I'll see you in the next one Time: 13:40 - 13:50Video is actually meant for 1cr but to appeal to masses he said 10L",

00:20 well it's real and today I'm going to reveal this hidden wealth building strategy that's hiding right in front of you hello everyone I'm UD ad and I've Time: 00:20 - 00:30 been licensed in Indian Financial Services since 2015 first in insurance and then in mutual funds and so far I have helped over 1,500 families make Time: 00:30 - 00:40 better financial decisions and here on my YouTube channel I talk about all things money and personal development now this strategy that I'm talking about is very underrated and often Time: 00:40 - 00:50 misunderstood I'm talking about NPS short for National pension system the new version of NPS that I like to call NP s 2.0 is a complete GameChanger and Time: 00:50 - 01:00 most people don't understand its true power now the word pension may be interpreted as something that only older people need but NPS is not just about Time: 01:00 - 01:10 pension it's about Building Wealth and saving taxes and the combination of the two is absolutely mindboggling and I'm going to share it all in today's video Time: 01:10 - 01:20 so first up let's talk about returns because let's be honest none of this matters if NPS has actually given lower returns then let's say a popular instrument like a mutual fund so let's Time: 01:20 - 01:30 check returns out over the last 10 years the average NPS scheme has given annual 10e returns of Time: 01:30 - 01:40 13.97% on the other hand the average 10year large cap mutual fund has given annualized returns of 13.2% now NPS can have a maximum Time: 01:40 - 01:50 allocation of 75% to stocks so a more ideal comparison would be an aggressive hybrid mutual fund which has a similar allocation the average aggressive hybrid Time: 01:50 - 02:00 mutual fund has generated a 10year cagr of 13.33% so despite having around 25% in safer assets like bonds both of these Time: 02:00 - 02:10 have actually done better than an all Equity portfolio but that's a topic for a completed different day so as you can see NPS so far the return that it has generated of Time: 02:10 - 02:20 13.97% is higher than even large cap mutual funds and aggressive hybrid mutual funds and this data is over a 10-year period so it's actually very ible but here's where it gets even more Time: 02:20 - 02:30 exciting NPS doesn't just offer competitive returns it comes with three huge advantages and of course no Time: 02:30 - 02:40 investment is perfect NPS does have two potential drawbacks too and I'll be breaking those down for you later in this video and yes while doing that I'm also going to tell you how NPS actually Time: 02:40 - 02:50 gives you a 42.8% return on the very first day of investing as well I promise you that was not clickbait and by the end of the video it also compare Time: 02:50 - 03:00 investing in NPS and mutual funds all factors considered so let's first explore how NPS investing really works and what it is so an NPS is actually Time: 03:00 - 03:10 quite similar to a mutual fund so through an NPS you can invest in assets like stocks bonds and even alternative instruments like reats just like there are many fund houses with different Time: 03:10 - 03:20 schemes there are 11 NPS pension fund managers this includes big names like HDFC ICI kotak bi and others you can Time: 03:20 - 03:30 choose which pension fund manager to go with and you can even change it once a year now in an NPS there are two types of accounts a tier one account and a Time: 03:30 - 03:40 tier 2 account there are a number of differences between the two but the biggest of them is Taxation and whether you're in the new tax regime or the old tax regime you can still find NPS Time: 03:40 - 03:50 beneficial and I'll tell you how right now first up an investment made in a tier one account can be used as a tax deduction up to 50,000 per year under section 80 CCD 1B under the old tax Time: 03:50 - 04:00 regime in fact making a contribution to your NPS tier one account this way is the only way to Avail this 50,000 deduction this is over and above the 1.5 Time: 04:00 - 04:10 lakhs popular deduction that people claim under Section 8C that you can aail by investing in EPF ppf elss mutual funds and Suk samdi yoga among many Time: 04:10 - 04:20 other such instruments in fact even an investment in The NPS qualifies for this 1.5 LH deduction so an invest M of Time: 04:20 - 04:30 50,000 in The NPS tier one account is an absolute no-brainer for anyone in the old tax regime because if you're in the 30% tax bracket it directly saves you 15,000 rupees per year if you've opted Time: 04:30 - 04:40 for the new tax regime then don't worry because you can simply ask your employer to contribute up to 14% of your basic salary to NPS and enjoy benefits under Time: 04:40 - 04:50 Section 80 ccd2 such a contribution by your employer even though it's a part of your pay is not taxable and this is a Time: 04:50 - 05:00 huge deal let me explain now let's say your employer contributes 10,000 per month towards your NPS the full 10,000 gets invested and you don't have to pay any tax on it if this amount weren't Time: 05:00 - 05:10 invested in an NPS and you were to get it as a salary then this entire amount would be taxable now if you are in the 30% tax bracket you would have to pay Time: 05:10 - 05:20 30% of this 10,000 rupees that is 3,000 rupees in taxes and you would only have 7,000 Rupees to invest now let's assume your employer did not make this contribution to your NPS and you still Time: 05:20 - 05:30 wanted to invest 10,000 per month so now to invest the same 10,000 rupees in a mutual fund you would need to earn 14,285 rupees pre-tax because 30% of Time: 05:30 - 05:40 this amount that is 4,285 rupees would go towards income taxes and only then you would have 10,000 rupees so by taking a part of your salary in the form Time: 05:40 - 05:50 of an employer's contribution to your NPS you have effectively saved 4,285 rupees per month that would have otherwise been paid as income tax Time: 05:50 - 06:00 that is equivalent to an initial 42.86 immediate return on your investment in terms of tax savings so yes by having your employer contribute Time: 06:00 - 06:10 to your NPS you have effectively earned a 42.86 return on your NPS contribution from day one thanks to the tax benefits now whenever people understand this it Time: 06:10 - 06:20 absolutely blows their mind it's also crazy how so few people are truly aware of this and if this was new information to you and it opened up a new way of Time: 06:20 - 06:30 thinking please consider subscribing to my channel here I aim to share all my personal finance knowledge with you in a completely honest and unbiased way now Time: 06:30 - 06:40 this employers contribution goes into the tier one account under the new tax regime the employer can contribute up to 14% of your basic salary to The NPS and Time: 06:40 - 06:50 under the old tax regime this number is up to 10% of your basic salary and in total a maximum of 7.5 lakhs can be contributed to it and this 7.5 lakhs Time: 06:50 - 07:00 also includes EPF and super annuation benefits for tier 2 accounts there is no tax advantage but you can always invest money in a tier two account and then Time: 07:00 - 07:10 switch that money into a tier one account to enjoy the tax benefits that are applicable under the tier one account then comes lockin period for tier one accounts you can only withdraw Time: 07:10 - 07:20 the full amount when you turn 60 years old but don't worry there are a few ways to access some of your funds earlier even though they come with a few rules Time: 07:20 - 07:30 so after completing 3 years you can make partial withdrawals but only up to 25% of your own contributions and these withdrawals are allowed for very specific reasons like medical Time: 07:30 - 07:40 emergencies the marriage of your kids education or buying a home among other such activities so there's flexibility but it's limited and very Purpose Driven Time: 07:40 - 07:50 now when you hit 60 the entire maturity amount from an NPS is taxfree which is a huge Advantage here's how it works 60% of your total Corpus can be withdrawn in Time: 07:50 - 08:00 one go or you can opt for a systematic lumsum withdrawal till the age of 75 think of this slw like a systematic withdrawal plan on an s swp in mutual Time: 08:00 - 08:10 funds where you can schedule your withdrawals based on your needs what about the remaining 40% that must be invested in an annuity plan what is an Time: 08:10 - 08:20 annuity plan so it is a life insurance product that gives you a fixed income for the rest of your life at present the annuity rate in India is around 7 to 7. 2% so if you invest 1 CR into an annuity Time: 08:20 - 08:30 you would receive about 7 lakhs every year regardless of whether interest rates are going up or down across the country now it's important to remember Time: 08:30 - 08:40 that this annuity amount that you get is entirely taxable as per your income tax lab later when I do a comparison between NPS and mutual funds we'll uh go through Time: 08:40 - 08:50 these taxation bits as well now there are multiple options and combinations when it comes to annuities and let me share my screen with you so that you can understand them and I can take you Time: 08:50 - 09:00 through them so I'm on the C nsdl website and you can find its Link in the description so you can also play around with this particular calculator uh so I've selected a private sector subscriber my age is 60 for this Time: 09:00 - 09:10 example I am male married and my spouse is also 60 years of age and I want to invest 1 CR in an annuity and once you Time: 09:10 - 09:20 see this you'll be able to select various options I've just selected select all so that I can compare which provider is giving me the highest annuity rate so here we go right first Time: 09:20 - 09:30 up you'll see there are two different options with return of purchase price and without return of purchase price so what with return of purchase price means is that this one CR that I have invested Time: 09:30 - 09:40 if I pass away then my nominee will get this entire one amount and as long as I'm alive I will get this 7.18% interest or annuity rather every Time: 09:40 - 09:50 single year and again this is taxable as per my income tax Lab at the time you'll notice various life insurance companies here are providing an annuity option and Time: 09:50 - 10:00 amongst these right amongst these amongst the very big life insurance companies IC credential here is providing 7.28 then Max life is at 7.36 and Tata AI is also at 7.28 so you Time: 10:00 - 10:10 know you can get a get an annuity of as high as 7.2 7.3% if it's a joint annuity then as long as both you and your spouse Time: 10:10 - 10:20 are alive you'll keep getting that particular annuity and when you pass away the person you have named as a nominee will get this one amount with Time: 10:20 - 10:30 return without return of purchase price here essentially means that this one CR if you pass away you would not get back or your nominee would not get back so that's why you notice the annuity rates here are higher in my experience if Time: 10:30 - 10:40 someone is investing in an annuity it's better to opt for you know either joint life or single life annuity with return of purchase price and without any Time: 10:40 - 10:50 deferment period so you start getting the annuity from the very first year there are options where let's say you get the annity after 5 years and instead of 7.18% here let's say you'll get 9% 9 Time: 10:50 - 11:00 and a half% that may sound great but because you haven't got that annuality for the first 5 three or 10 years whatever the deferment period you choose you actually end up losing out coming back to our comparison in tier 2 Time: 11:00 - 11:10 accounts there is no lockin at all this brings us to the two potential drawbacks of an NPS because while investing in a tier one account is where all the magic Time: 11:10 - 11:20 happens thanks to the tax benefits and disciplined investing it does come with a lockin period and the requirement to invest 40 % of your money in an annuity Time: 11:20 - 11:30 before diving deep into both these drawbacks let me quickly mention that both within the Tier 1 and tier 2 accounts you have the flexibility to choose between various asset classes and Time: 11:30 - 11:40 investing Styles I'm not going to get into those details right now because today's video is more focused on comparing NPS with mutual funds but for context I've selected scheme e uh for Time: 11:40 - 11:50 all calculations where 75% of your money is invested in stocks or equities so let's explore now these drawbacks and then compare NPS with mutual funds I Time: 11:50 - 12:00 actually think that the drawback potentially of loin is a blessing in disguise because this lockin forces you to stay disciplined no matter what's Time: 12:00 - 12:10 happening in the stock market people often panic when the market drops and they sell their Investments which may not be the best idea when it comes to investing for your long-term goals you Time: 12:10 - 12:20 ideally want to stay invested for a long time and even when the market is not doing well in an insightful episode of PESA vesa with anupam Gupta Shir AER the Time: 12:20 - 12:30 CEO of HDFC pension fund management shared a revealing analysis they studied two types of investors who had both invested 50,000 Rupees per year in The Time: 12:30 - 12:40 NPS for 15 years from 2009 to 2024 and here's the twist one investor sold during the market crashes of 2011 2015 Time: 12:40 - 12:50 and 2020 and only reinvested when the Markets started Rising the other investor had no choice but to stay invested because of the Locking Clause Time: 12:50 - 13:00 of The NPS what were the results they were astonishing the disciplined and logged in investor ended up with 37 lakhs Almost 100% more than the investor Time: 13:00 - 13:10 who panicked and withdrew who ended up with only about 18 lakhs shayer fittingly calls this the lockin bonus it's the payoff for sticking it out Time: 13:10 - 13:20 through the market ups and downs something most investors struggle with think about it in a world where Market fluctuations can even make seasoned Time: 13:20 - 13:30 investors anxious The NPS lockin acts as a shield protecting your wealth from your rash decisions it's not just a rule it's a safety mechanism that helps your Time: 13:30 - 13:40 money grow untouched and remember NPS if you think about it won't be the only investment you make while you're investing in NPS you'll also likely have mutual funds fixed deposits and EPF Time: 13:40 - 13:50 accounts as well The NPS should be your retirement Focus account while other instruments can also serve different goals and over time even some of your Time: 13:50 - 14:00 mutual fund investments will most likely end up funding a part of your retirement so let's talk about the second potential drawback the compulsory investment of 40% of your maturity amount into an Time: 14:00 - 14:10 annuity this may seem very restrictive because annuity generally offer as we saw lower returns compared to equities but let me add some context so when I'm Time: 14:10 - 14:20 talking to clients and doing retirement planning for either retirees or people close to retirement there is always a safe component in the port folio now Time: 14:20 - 14:30 don't get me wrong investments in equity mutual funds are important even for retirees but there's also a very heavy emphasis given to fixed income and safe instruments and that's where an annuity Time: 14:30 - 14:40 becomes a part of your Diversified approach to fixed income instruments in fact while annuity returns may seem low at the moment let me share a very interesting story of a client I spoke to Time: 14:40 - 14:50 a few years ago so before we met the client had purchased an annuity plan several years back when the interest rates were much higher across India so his annuity paid him an impressive if I Time: 14:50 - 15:00 remember correctly 11 to 12% per year how is that possible because even back then fixed deposits had Sky High interest rates so by locking in his Time: 15:00 - 15:10 annuity rate at that time he continues to enjoy that high interest or annu even though today while the rest of the market in the fixed income world has Time: 15:10 - 15:20 seen interest rates drop and generally interest rates tend to decline as a country develops so while a 7.2 7.3% Ann rate today might not seem thrilling Time: 15:20 - 15:30 imagine 15 years down the line if fixed deposit rates in India fall to 5% suddenly that 7% annu becomes a very Time: 15:30 - 15:40 attractive and valuable source of income also keep in mind once again that NPS is just one part of your overall investment plan the amount you invest in an annuity Time: 15:40 - 15:50 therefore will only be a small slice of your entire portfolio so this diversification ensures that you're not overly restricted by the annuity Time: 15:50 - 16:00 requirement having said that let's actually now compare NPS and mutual funds we'll go through a live Excel calculation where I will share with you how using the employer contribution Time: 16:00 - 16:10 feature of NPS will actually look like and how it impacts returns let's go through the sheet I understand that a lot is happening in it it may seem very daunting and difficult to go through but Time: 16:10 - 16:20 just follow my lead right so let's say the first value we want to enter is the monthly investment that you want to make right now if you ask your employ employer to make this through the form Time: 16:20 - 16:30 of an NPS contribution that entire 10,000 would get invested but you know if your income is taxable let's say in the 30% bracket then if you get this Time: 16:30 - 16:40 10,000 as salary you would only have 7,000 Rupees to invest because 30% 3,000 rupees would be paid as income tax so now in one year right in one year The Time: 16:40 - 16:50 NPS investment would be 1.2 lakhs where as the mutual fund investment would be 7,000 into 12 which is 84,000 and by the way you can access this sheet and play around with it using Time: 16:50 - 17:00 your numbers uh this sheet is available in the description and you can access it so now let's look at how the investment flow would look like over the years so let's say you get a hike of know let's say 7% every year so in that case the Time: 17:00 - 17:10 investment for the following year would be a little higher so let's drag this down remember though NPS investing is Time: 17:10 - 17:20 capped at 7.5 lakhs including EPF and super annuation contributions so the moment it crosses 7.5 lakhs we'll just cap it 7.5 so there you go I'm just Time: 17:20 - 17:30 going to drag this down yeah and even with mutual funds we'll compare apples to apples so we'll just increase our contribution by 7% now the reason I've included a 7% increase is because I've Time: 17:30 - 17:40 assumed a 7% hike in your salary every year so if your hike is different higher or lower again you can use the Excel sheet to play around with it right so Time: 17:40 - 17:50 let's go through with this and even here once it crosses 7.5 lakhs we will essentially just cap it at 7.5 right so the big Time: 17:50 - 18:00 difference that you first see is that over 35 years the total amount you have invested in NPS because you don't have to pay any tax on the Investments made is 1.49 crores whereas in mutual funds Time: 18:00 - 18:10 that is only 1.14 crores so we'll now add the investment value because remember even The NPS amount just like mutual funds gets invested in a diversified portfolio Time: 18:10 - 18:20 so let's first you know calculate how much that amount would grow by so there you go I'm just making a note of this so Time: 18:20 - 18:30 here I have The NPS 10 year cagr mutual fund 10 year cagr we'll also change these values and see how it also looks like for different let's say even the same kind of return but let's assume Time: 18:30 - 18:40 13.97 13.33 because that is the historical 10e average return at the moment right so with mutual funds so there you go that's the first year investment value then let's add up the Time: 18:40 - 18:50 second year value all right so now we have the year two value let's just drag it down to year 35 so we have 16 .73 crores at the end of the 35e tenure Time: 18:50 - 19:00 by investing in this NPS let's see how mutual funds do so I'll do the same thing here so there we go we have the second year value of mutual funds again Time: 19:00 - 19:10 you'll see a difference here of almost a LH right away in the second year itself and that is because right that is because the money that is getting invested is much lower so there is lower Time: 19:10 - 19:20 amount to compound and you'll see how this effect plays out as we pull down these returns for 35 years right so there you go uh with NPS we have 16.7 Time: 19:20 - 19:30 crores with mutual funds we have 10.38 crores and now if at that time right you want this money you would pay taxes of about Time: 19:30 - 19:40 1.29 crores on this amount because with Equity mutual funds long-term taxation as we know if you've been a friend of this channel is that every year you get 1.25 lakhs tax free and then whatever Time: 19:40 - 19:50 the amount for long-term capital gains is taxed at 12 1.2% so this is the value 1.29 so the post tax value is 16.73% uh for NPS because it has no tax whereas Time: 19:50 - 20:00 for mutual funds it is 9.08 crores so this difference is 7.64 cres again you can go through the Time: 20:00 - 20:10 sheet you can go through the calculations but that is how Stark the difference is having said that having said that we should also consider the annuality factor because remember 60% of Time: 20:10 - 20:20 this money can be withdrawn either as a lump suum or through systematic withdrawals but 40% has to be invested in an annuity and then the 40% would attract a tax right so let's first look at what this 60% amount would be so Time: 20:20 - 20:30 we'll just multiply this by 60% and we have about 10 cres there whereas we now calculate the remaining annuality amount that has to be invested in it which is Time: 20:30 - 20:40 about 6.69 cres now we saw an annuity rate we'll quickly go through just the table once again we saw here that for Time: 20:40 - 20:50 single life the highest annuity rate offered by a big life insurance company is Max life here correct 7.36 so we'll just assume that in this case so here we Time: 20:50 - 21:00 go 7.36 then in that case this 7.36% is what you would get right what you would get on this 6.69 CR so every year you'll Time: 21:00 - 21:10 get 49 lakhs as annuity amount now remember this is going to be after 30 years so in that case a few things may Time: 21:10 - 21:20 happen right firstly the annuity rate could be higher lower and secondly 49 lakhs seems like a huge amount but inflation adjusted won't be as much Time: 21:20 - 21:30 having said that you would pay a tax of 14 lakhs right 14 lakhs on this 49 if you're in a 30% tax bracket and the annuity tax that you would pay over 30 Time: 21:30 - 21:40 years would be this 14 lakhs into 30 years which is about 4.43 crores so even after factoring in this tax of over 4 Time: 21:40 - 21:50 crores right in annual you will still end up with a higher amount of 3.2 crores by investing in an annuity by considering all taxes now there are few practical points to be aware of here Time: 21:50 - 22:00 most likely when you retire you wouldn't redeem this entire 10 CR in one go right uh so this 1.29 CR tax will be spread Time: 22:00 - 22:10 over a period of time whereas even with an annuity uh the total tax that you are paying right of 14 lakh 77,000 while that amount will stay Time: 22:10 - 22:20 constant provided the income tax rate is 30% but the actual buying power the actual real money value of that 14 OD lacks will be lower because of inflation Time: 22:20 - 22:30 but I haven't considered that because that is getting into the ntegrity is way too much and it sort of evens out because you know again this amount you wouldn't withdraw in one go you withdraw over a period of time so 3.21 crores Time: 22:30 - 22:40 that's how much extra money you would have by simply opting for a part of your salary 10,000 rupees through an NPS rather than taking it as a salary having Time: 22:40 - 22:50 said that right having said that when comparing NPS and mutual funds it's not an either or choice but rather a both and and strategy you get the tax savings Time: 22:50 - 23:00 and Market discipline from an NPS and the flexibility and growth opportunities from Mutual Funds because a lot of these NPS schemes that are investing money in Time: 23:00 - 23:10 the stock market they're investing in the largest companies whereas mutual funds allow you to also invest in midcap stocks small cap stocks different styles of investing whereas that option is not available with NPS so it's about a Time: 23:10 - 23:20 balance of protection tax savings and maximizing the power of compounding the idea of this entire video for was to invite you to think about NPS investing Time: 23:20 - 23:30 and how it can seriously help you achieve your financial goals if you likeed this video then please subscribe to the channel and watch this one where I talk about systematic withdrawal plans Time: 23:30 - 23:40 a way to generate regular income from your Mutual finds and I'll see you in the next one Time: 23:40 - 23:50Kindly do not misguide the public with wrong headlines. The saving is not actual, the returns aren't that much attractive in NPS.",

00:20 years down the line now just imagine this investing 15,000 per month through an sip with a 10% annual step up for 25 years years will allow you to get 40 Time: 00:20 - 00:30 lakh rupees per year for 30 years which at that time would be worth about 12 lakhs per year or 1 lakh per month because of inflation and what's the best Time: 00:30 - 00:40 part you can keep increasing that 40 lakh per your withdrawal to keep up with inflation for all those 30 years so by the end of it in total you would have Time: 00:40 - 00:50 withdrawn well over 28 cres and I'll show you how you can do that in just a bit in this video I'm going to dive deep into s swps how you you can use them and Time: 00:50 - 01:00 which are the best mutual funds to start an s swp from hello everyone I'm udad I've been licensed in Indian Financial Services since 2015 first in insurance Time: 01:00 - 01:10 and then mutual funds and so far I have helped over 1,000 families make better financial decisions and on my YouTube channel I talk about all things in money Time: 01:10 - 01:20 and personal development so what exactly is a systematic withdrawal plan or an S swp before I explain if you're serious about investing I'm hosting a post Time: 01:20 - 01:30 Finance master class on 15th September and you can register for it using the link in the description in this session you will get access to eight proprietary personal finance calculators that I Time: 01:30 - 01:40 actually use while working with my clients including several of the Excel sheets that you've seen in my videos I'll also teach you how to select mutual funds for your long-term goals like Time: 01:40 - 01:50 retirement where exactly to invest for short-term goals like going for your dream vacation and how to avoid getting scammed by insurance companies and I'm Time: 01:50 - 02:00 excited to share these insights with you so make sure that you grab your seat through the link in the description because spots are limited now let's talk about s swps an S swp is quite simply a Time: 02:00 - 02:10 method of investing just like in an sip that is a systematic investment plan where you invest money in a mutual fund on a regular basis in an S swp you withdraw money from a mutual fund on a Time: 02:10 - 02:20 regular basis here's how it works you first up instruct a mutual fund house on how much money you want to withdraw from which fund on what date and for how long Time: 02:20 - 02:30 for example let's say you've invested 10 lakhs in the SBI balanced Advantage fund and you want to get about 10,000 rupees as regular income from it and this is Time: 02:30 - 02:40 not a sponsored video by any means I'm going to mention several fund names and none of these fund houses are paying me to say their names this is just me talking about them to give you an idea Time: 02:40 - 02:50 so in this case now you would simply instruct the Funhouse SBI in this case to start an S swp of 10,000 rupees per month on say the first of every month Time: 02:50 - 03:00 for one year once the S swp is registered and right at the end of the video I'll tell you how you can go about this as well SBI will sell units from your investment worth 10,000 rupees on Time: 03:00 - 03:10 the first of every month for 12 months and then you'll get that money in your bank account within two working days so the 10,000 rupees that you receive is Time: 03:10 - 03:20 essentially for all purposes a Redemption order but by setting up an S swp you can schedule that Redemption as per your needs now let's see how this actually plays out in real life with the Time: 03:20 - 03:30 actual example of the SBI balanced Advantage fund and I'm going to share an Excel sheet so you understand it better so here you go there's a lot happening in the table that I know but just follow Time: 03:30 - 03:40 me along for a few seconds uh here in this column that I'm highlighting is the date of where you first invested so you put in 10 lakh Rupees on 1st August 2023 Time: 03:40 - 03:50 and in return for that you got about 81433 units and at that time the fund nav was 12.28 and then from that very day you start Time: 03:50 - 04:00 withdrawing money 10,000 rupees per month for the next 12 months so you withdraw money every month now in that case you'll notice a few things here Time: 04:00 - 04:10 first up the number of units that you now have they start reducing progressively and because the nav here which is the value of the fund that is Time: 04:10 - 04:20 increasing the number of units that you withdraw is also reducing because now every unit is worth much more so if you think about it you start start off at Time: 04:20 - 04:30 about 10 lakh Rupees and then you withdraw 10,000 per month so you've totally withdrawn 1.2 lakhs so in that case the fund value by the end of that one year should be lower than 10 lakhs Time: 04:30 - 04:40 correct but here's what happens if you notice the fund value is Time: 04:40 - 04:50 10.77% so even though your withdrawal rate is 12% the fund has actually grown by about 21% and because of that you end Time: 04:50 - 05:00 up with a higher amount and that is the beauty of an s swp that if the fund where youve invested money that grows at a faster rate than your withdrawal rate Time: 05:00 - 05:10 you actually end up with higher money even though you've taken money out of that fund now this brings me to a very very important Point how do you decide how much income can you actually Time: 05:10 - 05:20 generate through an S swp because if you withdraw too much money too high an amount the money that you've invested will just get over imagine the same 10 Time: 05:20 - 05:30 lakh rupe investment but now you withdraw 1 lakh rupees per month what would happen then we'll actually see that so we'll withdraw 1 lakh and now you'd see that in the 11th Time: 05:30 - 05:40 month itself you have now run out of money because you because your balance turns negative so you're no longer able to withdraw the amount that you want to Time: 05:40 - 05:50 withdraw for as long as you want to withdraw and this is happened at a time when the portfolio when the fund has actually generated about 21% returns which which is extremely extremely high Time: 05:50 - 06:00 so your withdrawal amount must be lower than the return your investment is generating that's why the amount that you can withdraw depends on three factors first up for how many years do Time: 06:00 - 06:10 you need to generate an income from your Investments number two how much income needs to be generated and number three the expected Returns on your investment Time: 06:10 - 06:20 and its variations because if you think about it in this one year the SBI balance Advantage fund generated over 20% returns but that would not be the case every single year at times it could Time: 06:20 - 06:30 even generate negative returns so how does that then affect the withdrawals that take place now all these three factors are interconnected and you just cannot look at them in isolation so I'm Time: 06:30 - 06:40 going to share with you three s swp setups so that it becomes crystal clear as to how to use S swps the first includes an S swp for Financial Freedom Time: 06:40 - 06:50 and right at the end I'm also going to share a bonus fourth swp setup with you that will absolutely blow your mind it's of a real life mutual fund case study and not exaggerating when I say that now Time: 06:50 - 07:00 let's see how s swps can be used for achieving Financial Independence or can fund your retirement so this is my fire or retirement number calculator and Time: 07:00 - 07:10 we'll enter a hypothetical age here let's say you're 30 years old and your retirement age when you want to retire is 55 so that's 25 years later and the Time: 07:10 - 07:20 income that you want during retirement is about 1 lakh rupees now while entering 1 lakh do not consider inflation because this calcul letter has Time: 07:20 - 07:30 inbuilt features where it already takes that into account and gives you the number that you need now let's say inflation is 5% and your life expectancy is 85 years in that case you would need Time: 07:30 - 07:40 7.18 crores by the time you're 55 to be able to draw this 1 lakh rupes inflation Time: 07:40 - 07:50 adjusted till you're 85 years old and by the way once you sign up for my personal finance Master Class you can get this fire or retirement number calculator along with seven other such personal Time: 07:50 - 08:00 finance Excel sheets including a stepup calculator that we'll now put values in to see how you can get to this 7.18 cres Time: 08:00 - 08:10 that you would want so so let's say you're starting an sip of 15,000 rupees and you get about a 133% return on it the reason I've assumed 13% is because the Indian stock market for a Time: 08:10 - 08:20 diversified portfolio where you have large mid and small caps has historically over the past 25 30 years done more than 14 15% so i' actually Time: 08:20 - 08:30 assumed a slightly lower rate and we have a 10% step up so as your income goes up you keep increasing and you want this money 25 years later because that's when you would retire so in that case Time: 08:30 - 08:40 you would have about 7.36 crors and if you remember we need about 7.18 CR now let's say you do get to that 7 odd CR amount and you're 55 Time: 08:40 - 08:50 years old what happens then and that is when s swps actually start kicking in for retirement or Financial Freedom this 7.18 crores would get invested in a Time: 08:50 - 09:00 diversified portfolio that has some equities through mutual funds that also has gold bonds maybe some government schemes that are active at that point Time: 09:00 - 09:10 maybe some real estate but the idea is this 7 odd CR is invested and that gives you a certain kind of Return of say about 8 and a half to 10% somewhere in Time: 09:10 - 09:20 between that and then that 7 crores keeps growing because it's growing by that say 10% every year but at the same time you're withdrawing certain amount from it every single year to fund your Time: 09:20 - 09:30 lifestyle to fund everything that you need money for which is what I'm going to show you now in this particular uh cash flow sheet it's a part of the Time: 09:30 - 09:40 retirement calculator itself and it may seem complicated so I'm going to break it down for you just follow where my mouse goes so you know exactly what is happening so you need this money 25 Time: 09:40 - 09:50 years later because that's when you want to retire the year is 2049 you're 55 years old and what you want is equivalent of 12 lakh rupees because Time: 09:50 - 10:00 that's how much money we have entered right 1 lakh per month that's 12 lakhs per year but the thing is 25 years later that 12 lakhs is going to be worth 4.63 Time: 10:00 - 10:10 lakhs so you'll need to withdraw 4.63 lakhs to be able to buy things worth that are 1 lakh today so just see how Time: 10:10 - 10:20 inflation plays a role as the year's role and the 40 lakhs doesn't stay constant right because even in 2049 there will be inflation so that 40 lakhs will also we have to be hiked up and you Time: 10:20 - 10:30 would need more and more money every year so if you look at it this amount progressively increases as you grow older to an extent where you know your last withdrawal of when you are 85 years Time: 10:30 - 10:40 old is 175 lakhs if you can again see where my mouse is hovering right now so that's the impact of inflation and that's very important to understand when Time: 10:40 - 10:50 it comes to S swps and also retirement planning now what happens is as I told you this 7.18 crores gets invested and then that grows in this case uh at about Time: 10:50 - 11:00 8.75% post taxes so the 7.18 grows becomes about 7.81 and at the same time you're withdrawing money worth about 40.6 lakhs Time: 11:00 - 11:10 from this retirement portfolio that you have built up so that next year when you start off you have 7.4 crores that again Grows by 8.75% and you're again Time: 11:10 - 11:20 withdrawing a certain amount in this case 42.6 6 lakhs and that keeps continuing right that keeps continuing so if you notice in ially the amount by Time: 11:20 - 11:30 which your money is growing in the portfolio is higher than the 40 42 45 lakhs that you withdrawing so your Investment Portfolio actually grows for Time: 11:30 - 11:40 a while so if you notice during all these years so from 7.18 crores it has grown to about 9.68 crores and then it starts reducing because at this stage your portfolio you Time: 11:40 - 11:50 are taking out much more money from it you're taking about 80 85 lakhs to be able to fund a lifestyle worth 12 lakh rupees per year So eventually by the Time: 11:50 - 12:00 time you're 85 you would have zero rupees so you go down to Zero by withdrawing everything that you have to fund your retirement now I know you may be wondering why do you need over 7 Time: 12:00 - 12:10 crores to be able to fund your retirement why can't you just invest that in a fixed deposit that grows at 7% every year and you get that interest so Time: 12:10 - 12:20 you'll get about 50 lakh rupees in interest and that will fund your retirement now let me actually enter 7% here instead of 10% across the portfolio Time: 12:20 - 12:30 you get a 7% return and let's say you're in the 20% tax bracket now in that case the post tax return is 5.6% and now you need 10.9 to 11 crores instead of about Time: 12:30 - 12:40 77.1 crores and that is because now your portfolio is growing at a lower rate so it's essential to have some high growth Time: 12:40 - 12:50 element even in the portfolio when someone has retired like equities because that just provides the kicker where that 10% growth across the portfolio is possible so of the 100 Time: 12:50 - 13:00 rupees that let's say you have to invest you invest about 50 60% in equities and the rest across other assets that's why having only a fixed deposit may not be the best idea because you need that Time: 13:00 - 13:10 higher growth rate plus there can be a higher taxation on fixed deposits and I'll explore that in just a bit in the second s swp setup let's say you only need money for the next 5 years and that Time: 13:10 - 13:20 could be required to pay back a loan or you just require money for day-to-day expenses until your income stabilizes or even for kids education it could be be anything the usual rules of equity Time: 13:20 - 13:30 investing apply here and because 5 years is not considered as long-term while investing in stocks we ideally don't want to invest in an all Equity portfolio the approach to take here Time: 13:30 - 13:40 could be to select a balanced fund that invests both in stocks and bonds and the rational for this is very simple because let's say you investing 10 lakh Rupees and you want to generate an income from Time: 13:40 - 13:50 it and soon after you invest within 6 months the stock market goes down by 30% so now your 10 lakhs has essentially gone down to 7 lakhs and now you have a lower amount from Time: 13:50 - 14:00 which you can generate that income so there could be a higher possibility that you may not have enough money to keep drawing that income that you want whereas if you have a balanced fund Time: 14:00 - 14:10 which is say investing both 50% in stocks and 50% in bonds then you're cushioned against that massive fall so even if the market goes down by 30% you Time: 14:10 - 14:20 will essentially go down by around 10 to 15% so your fall wouldn't be 3 lakhs it will be about 1 to 1 and a half lakhs that's why you want to go for balance funds and I'm sharing two popular Time: 14:20 - 14:30 examples with you both have a very long history they've been around for a long time the first is the HDFC Balan Advantage fund and as you can see how it invests its money only 50% is in equity Time: 14:30 - 14:40 whereas the rest is in very safe assets 28% in debt 20% in cash so that's the very safe element of the portfolio and Time: 14:40 - 14:50 the second popular balance fund is the icsi credential balanced Advantage fund and even that only has about 52 53% in equity rest in safer assets so you can see how that would protect you if the Time: 14:50 - 15:00 market Falls and you've invested in these particular funds let's go to my Excel sheet so we can go through a few combinations and you can get this Excel sheet for free in the link down below so Time: 15:00 - 15:10 you can work out your s swp calculations so let's say you have 15 lakh rupees now that you want to invest and the income that you want to generate is let's say 25,000 rupees in that case if you Time: 15:10 - 15:20 withdraw 25,000 adjusted for a 6% inflation you would still have 2.37 lakh rupees left at the end of 5 years after Time: 15:20 - 15:30 having taken out 16.9 lakhs now one very interesting thing that you would see here is that the interest or the return specifically in this case that I have assumed is 8% which is much lower than Time: 15:30 - 15:40 let's say if we go to HDFC balance advantage and see how much it has generated in the past 5 years which is about 22.2% the category as a whole the Time: 15:40 - 15:50 dynamic asset allocation category has generated 14.25 so why have I selected 8% that is because I want to bacon into this calculation a certain amount of Safety Time: 15:50 - 16:00 and Security because again you don't want to be ideally in a position where you're withdrawing way too much money Way Beyond what's suggested and then at the end you don't have any money left Time: 16:00 - 16:10 because you know if let's say this portfolio Grows by 12% then you'll have about 5.2 lakhs left instead of half of that earlier on so it's always good to Time: 16:10 - 16:20 have higher money because that's a bonus and not have lower money and balance funds make sense for a five year Horizon if you have a shorter Horizon that's less than say 2 years then I think Time: 16:20 - 16:30 investing in bond funds makes the most amount of sense because investing in equities just exposes you to a certain amount of risk whereas if it's anywhere Time: 16:30 - 16:40 between 2 and 5 years you can consider something called as an equity savings fund the third s swp setup involves waiting for some time before you start withdrawing money now what do I mean by Time: 16:40 - 16:50 that so let's say you have 15 lakhs for from which you have to draw an income then you invest that in a balanced fund and you wait for years so assuming a 10% Time: 16:50 - 17:00 return that has grown to 24.15 lakhs now just think about it we'll go back to our s swp calculator and we'll enter 24.5 lakhs Time: 17:00 - 17:10 here you see how that changes the game right initially at a 12% return you had about 5 and half lakhs now you have 21.9 lakhs Time: 17:10 - 17:20 so what does that mean that means you can withdraw much higher amounts let's see how withdrawing 50,000 plays out there you go so you have 76,000 rupees Time: 17:20 - 17:30 left which is again too close for comfort but you can then withdraw 40,000 rupees and you will have that Comfort level baked in of about 9.24 lakhs now this approach of just waiting for some Time: 17:30 - 17:40 time before you start withdrawing has to be well thought out because you have to plan in advance but that can significantly boost how your portfolio performs and it can also significantly Time: 17:40 - 17:50 protect you against Big Falls in the market because you've given your portfolio some runtime and that brings me to the fourth bonus setup that I talked about that will absolutely blow your mind so this is the HDFC balance Time: 17:50 - 18:00 Advantage fund it was launched in February 1994 so let's say someone had invested 1 CR Rupees at that time and I know 1 CR 30 years ago was a huge amount Time: 18:00 - 18:10 so don't consider absolute numbers here because just just think of it as you're investing one CR today and if the portfolio does similarly in the next 30 Time: 18:10 - 18:20 Years how it would look like so you invested 1 CR in February 1994 and you started your first withdrawal in February 1999 that is after after a 5year Runway and how much did you Time: 18:20 - 18:30 withdraw 1 lakh rupees per month and you increased it by 10% every year to account for inflation so now in that case if I go to this table you would see Time: 18:30 - 18:40 that in 1994 you obviously put in 1 lakh but by the time you started withdrawing money from it the portfolio was almost 1 and a half CR worth which is Time: 18:40 - 18:50 mindboggling so you start withdrawing 1 lakh rupees in the first year and by the end in 20 24 when you made your last Time: 18:50 - 19:00 withdrawal because of inflation any guesses how much that amount would have been that you withdrew in August that would have been 10.83 lakhs because of Time: 19:00 - 19:10 inflation so the total money that you have withdrawn over these 307 months is 12.56 crores but despite that you have 86.2 crores believe it or not this is a Time: 19:10 - 19:20 real life example of an actual fund and how it has done if you had an s swp in it the returns this mutual fund has generated is crazy High 18.7 s but that Time: 19:20 - 19:30 is the power of you know just waiting for some time and then seeing how it plays out now let's say you had not waited at all and started withdrawing right away from February 1994 onwards itself and how this portfolio would have Time: 19:30 - 19:40 looked like so the money that you were withdrawing because you did not let it run for a while the money would have gotten over in 2003 so if you notice the Time: 19:40 - 19:50 money just gets over in 2003 so that's why if you have an S swp and you have the Liberty to wait for some time before you can start withdrawing from it take that chance because it's just going to Time: 19:50 - 20:00 put you in a much stronger position it's going to give you a stronger footing to draw an income from that portfolio now one of the biggest advantages of having an S swp is potentially lower taxation Time: 20:00 - 20:10 because if you're investing in Balance funds and start withdrawing money after 2 years your withdrawals are classified as long-term capital gains so every year Time: 20:10 - 20:20 you'll get 1.25 lakhs of taxfree gains and after that you'll have to pay a capital gains tax of 12.5% on the profit that you have booked if you have an S Time: 20:20 - 20:30 swp from an Equity Fund then long-term capital gains tax will be applicable after one year of investing itself on the other hand in a fixed deposit the entire interest that is paid to you is Time: 20:30 - 20:40 always taxed as per your income tax lab so let's assume that both the fixed deposit and the balance fund are generating 7% annual returns and you're Time: 20:40 - 20:50 withdrawing it entirely and you're in the 30% tax bracket in that case your post tax returns as you can see will be the highest for an S swp how does it Time: 20:50 - 21:00 look like for a 20% bracket again the highest for an S swp if it's 10% or lower then the FD may seem lucrative if you get a 7% return in both cases but Time: 21:00 - 21:10 historically balance funds over a 5 to 7ear period have beaten fixed deposits so that's where even if you get a higher return post tax for an FD at a 7% rate Time: 21:10 - 21:20 the balance fund could very well have generated 10 12% returns so it kind of mitigates the tax benefits there as well so if you want to set up an S swp what Time: 21:20 - 21:30 are the kinds of mutual funds that you should be investing in in an ideal situation it should be a diversified portfolio with at least 50 to 60% of your money in equities that is stocks Time: 21:30 - 21:40 through mutual funds and then the rest of the money spread across other assets like bonds gold and even real estate this is ideal because it reduces the risk while investing which is even more Time: 21:40 - 21:50 important when you have an s swp coming out from that fund but having said that it's perfectly possible to set up an s WP from an all Equity Fund if that is Time: 21:50 - 22:00 what you're thinking aim to have a slightly lower withdrawal rate especially at the start let your portfolio grow over 5 to 7 years and then if it has indeed increased in value Time: 22:00 - 22:10 perhaps You' be able to withdraw a slightly higher amount one important point to remember not all platforms allow you to set up an S swp if yours Time: 22:10 - 22:20 doesn't then you can set it up via cams kintech or directly via the mutual fund websites dashboard also with an s swp you are essentially withdrawing money Time: 22:20 - 22:30 from your Investments so it does affect the process of compounding because now you have lower money invested than if you had not withdrawn anything at all but we all need money to live our dreams Time: 22:30 - 22:40 and live our life so an S swp could be a wonderful idea to fund those expenses if used smartly that's it for today if you're interested in it register for my Time: 22:40 - 22:50 master class using the link below the like button and I'll catch you in the next one Time: 22:50 - 23:00If buffet selling, then is this a good time to buy stocks? I know everyone is saying stocks are at a discount, while some are overpriced and all but just how long will It take to be stable in this distort economy or am I better off putting my money elsewhere. I need a lot as rent, inflation alone eat up almost all of what I make with dependents and other obligations included. Tbh it's an uncertain year for me.",

00:30 them could be a wonderful idea hello everyone I'm UD I've been licensed in the Indian Financial Services space since 2015 first in insurance and then in mutual funds and so far I have helped Time: 00:30 - 00:40 over 1,000 families make better financial decisions and here on my YouTube channel I talk about all things money and personal development the first Time: 00:40 - 00:50 type of factor follows something called as the momentum style of investing now check this out the index that tracks it has returned over 60% % in the past one Time: 00:50 - 01:00 year that means if you had invested 1 lakh rupes exactly one year ago it would have today become 1.6 lakhs in just 12 months but here's what really caught my Time: 01:00 - 01:10 eye an sip in this momentum index has generated 5year median rolling returns of 18.9% while the nifty50 which is India's top 50 stocks has grown at Time: 01:10 - 01:20 12.8% now that is a big difference right in sip terms if you think about it a 10,000 per month sip investment in in the momentum index would have grown to Time: 01:20 - 01:30 about 10 lakhs while the same sip in the nifty 50 index would have grown to 8.43 lakhs the index is the Nifty 200 momentum 30 index and to really get to Time: 01:30 - 01:40 know how it works you need to understand the momentum style of investing here's how it works in momentum investing you're not at all focused on a company's Time: 01:40 - 01:50 profit Revenue margins its p ratio or anything else like that what's the only thing literally the only thing that matters the price of its stock or as the famous Gujarati phrase goes B Bagan or Time: 01:50 - 02:00 that price is God momentum investing is all about this one simple idea a stock that has been going up for a while is Time: 02:00 - 02:10 likely to keep going up a little longer and the same goes for a stock that has been going down it's probably going to keep sliding down that's momentum investing in a nutshell and the Nifty Time: 02:10 - 02:20 200 momentum 30 index is made up of 30 stocks selected from the largest 200 stocks in India which includes large midcaps now these 30 stocks that are Time: 02:20 - 02:30 selected are the ones with the strongest momentum in this universe of 200 stocks now momentum is calculated through a very scientific process called as the normalized momentum score which looks at Time: 02:30 - 02:40 the stocks 6 Monon and 12- month price returns adjusted for volatility there are five index funds that track this particular momentum index they're Time: 02:40 - 02:50 offered by UTI motil oswal icsa credential bundan and HDFC now usually you would select an index fund that has the lowest total expense rati and Time: 02:50 - 03:00 tracking error now all these index funds are relatively new so I would not really even consider tracking error at the moment which is the difference between the returns of the index and the index Time: 03:00 - 03:10 fund having said that mtila and IC credentials index funds in this particular space stand out because they have the lowest expense ratios but UTI having said that has the oldest and Time: 03:10 - 03:20 largest Fund in this space its expense ratio is higher by 0.16% which honestly is not that big a deal just to put this in perspective Ive Time: 03:20 - 03:30 a 10,000 per month sip for 10 years that grows at 15.16 annually would grow to 2814 lakhs but if the growth rate was 15% that is only 0.16% lower it would Time: 03:30 - 03:40 have grown to 27.8 6 lakhs which is about 40,000 rupees lower now let's compare the Nifty 200 momentum 30 index Time: 03:40 - 03:50 and the nifty 50 now this is how an sip in both would have grown as you can see the darker line is the momentum index whereas the lighter line is the nifty50 index Time: 03:50 - 04:00 and if you notice the momentum index has always given higher returns than the nifty50 index just to put that in perspective let's say where my mouse is hovering right now that calculates Time: 04:00 - 04:10 returns for an sip from 1st January 2013 to 1st January 2018 and during that period if you look at it the nifty50 had annualized returns Time: 04:10 - 04:20 of 13.9% whereas the momentum index was 28.6% so more than double of the nifty50 index and even during the covid crash even at the lowest point on 1st April Time: 04:20 - 04:30 2020 you see that the momentum index actually gave positive 3% returns whereas nifty50 was minus 4.42% and when the markets have been Time: 04:30 - 04:40 doing well the momentum index has been Head and Shoulders above the nifty-50 index the second type of factor is another momentum index but this one Time: 04:40 - 04:50 focuses solely on midcap stocks it is called the Nifty midcap 150 momentum 50 index and I'll tell you how it gets its name so it El 50 stocks with the highest Time: 04:50 - 05:00 momentum from a pool of 150 midcap stocks this particular index has returned 70. 75% in the past one year Time: 05:00 - 05:10 how does it stack up against the normal midcap 150 index since April 2005 an sip in the Nifty midcap 150 index has had a median 5year rolling return of Time: 05:10 - 05:20 18.9% which means a 10,000 per month sip in it would have grown to about 10 lakhs in 5 years on the other hand the momentum midcap index has returned to Time: 05:20 - 05:30 24.1% and the same sip would have grown to 11.66 lakhs at the same time when it comes to explosive wonderful performance the momentum index is the clear winner Time: 05:30 - 05:40 for an sip it has delivered over 20% annual returns over any 5year period 65.9% of the time which is insanely Time: 05:40 - 05:50 consistent the midcap index has crossed 20% annual returns 41.6% of the time so what is my preferred way to invest in this particular space I personally like Time: 05:50 - 06:00 to balance a midcap momentum fund along with a regular midcap fund now when you're investing in two funds in the same space you have to look at overlap so if you look at the two largest Time: 06:00 - 06:10 players in this particular space which is the HDFC midcap fund and the kotak midcap fund and if we compare that against the momentum midcap uh Index Time: 06:10 - 06:20 Fund then we'll see how that plays out so I'm going to enter the HDFC fund it's called the midcap opportunities fund and let's see how much the overlap is only Time: 06:20 - 06:30 18% so we are clear there and if we look at say the kotak emerging equities fund which is the kotak midcap fund the overlap is again 23% which is again Time: 06:30 - 06:40 supremely low now Ed and Tata have index funds that track this particular category of midcap momentum index funds and since their expense ratios are pretty similar you can essentially go Time: 06:40 - 06:50 with either one if you're looking to invest in this space now let's compare the midcap momentum index against the regular midcap index momentum index at Time: 06:50 - 07:00 literally every point in time except for a short period at the start in early 2000s very very short period of time except for that it has always always outperformed the midcap 150 index even Time: 07:00 - 07:10 during the covid crash if you notice the performance of the momentum fund was actually better than the pure midcap index and one of the reasons for that is Time: 07:10 - 07:20 if you remember what I shared as to how momentum investing works when a stock starts falling in price it is more like ly to fall as per the momentum style of Time: 07:20 - 07:30 investing methodology now because of that the moment that starts happening fund managers tend to get out of positions and they tend to hold more Time: 07:30 - 07:40 cash at times and because of that at times the fall can be cushioned the third type of factor is the Nifty Alpha 50 which has returned a whopping Time: 07:40 - 07:50 77.9 5% in the past one year it's an index of 50 stocks that has been selected from the 300 largest stocks in India and the way these 50 stocks are selected Time: 07:50 - 08:00 is very unique so in the world of investing Alpha means the difference between the performance of a security like say a stock against its comparable Time: 08:00 - 08:10 index so let's check that the nifty50 in the past one year has given 26.8% we'll compare that against State Bank of India stock and see if there's a Time: 08:10 - 08:20 difference there so I'll enter SBI here so as you can see in the past one year the nifty50 at 26% plus whereas SBI is Plus 41% so SBI has an alpha of about Time: 08:20 - 08:30 15% in this particular instance now in the Nifty Alpha 50 index the performance of the top 300 stocks is ranked as per the alpha they have generated and the Time: 08:30 - 08:40 stock with the highest Alpha is given the largest weightage and the top 50 stocks from within that form the Nifty Alpha 50 index at this moment Kalan Time: 08:40 - 08:50 dwellers suzlon energy and Indian Railway Finance Corporation have the highest allocation in this particular index as of July 2024 now let's quickly compare the returns of the alpha 50 Time: 08:50 - 09:00 index and the nifty 50 index and how an sip in both would have done over the years if you notice the alpha 50 index generally has done better than the nifty50 index except for a very short Time: 09:00 - 09:10 period in the late 2000 and early 2010s uh even during the covid crash if you notice at the lowest point the Time: 09:10 - 09:20 nifty50 index was negative minus 4% over a 5year period for an sip whereas the alpha 15 index was a little higher than that and - 2.6 and as the market Time: 09:20 - 09:30 recovered Alpha 50 index really shot up and if you notice in the past 5 years the alpha 50 index has returned annualized returns of 40% whereas the Time: 09:30 - 09:40 nifty50 is half of that at 21 odd per. to give you the exact numbers an sip in the Nifty Alpha 50 index has given median 5year rolling returns of Time: 09:40 - 09:50 17.7% while the nifty 50 has returned 133% now that just means that sip of 10,000 rupees per month in the alpha 50 index would have become about 9.6 laks in 5 years while in the nifty 50 it Time: 09:50 - 10:00 would have grown to 8.48 lakhs but remember the alpha 50 index comes with its own risks it is more volatile and that's understandable since all the Time: 10:00 - 10:10 stocks in it are selected based on how much they move compared to the index so it has a standard deviation of 10.19 versus nifty50 is 4.68 and right now kotak and bandhan Time: 10:10 - 10:20 offer funds that track this particular index their total expense ratios are 0.3 and 0.34 respectively so there's hardly Time: 10:20 - 10:30 any difference between the two now this index can be a good idea if you're okay with handling it's much higher volatility I personally stay away from it and would rather prefer a momentum Time: 10:30 - 10:40 index or even a good old nifty50 index because of the alpha index's higher volatility the fourth type is the Nifty top 10 equal weight index which has Time: 10:40 - 10:50 given 20.32 returns in the past year this index only has 10 stocks and they selected from a universe of the 50 largest stocks in India or the nifty50 Time: 10:50 - 11:00 these 10 stocks are the largest stocks within the nifty50 index and an equal allocation is assigned to each stock and Time: 11:00 - 11:10 the index is rebalanced every 6 months it is kind of a new Index right now and was only launched in June 2024 and currently in fact has only one fund that tracks it which is floated by Time: 11:10 - 11:20 DSP this is how the index looks like in August 2024 and currently infosis ITC and TCS have the highest allocation in it now this allocation will keep Time: 11:20 - 11:30 changing based on how these top 10 stocks perform and after 6 months the index will be rebalanced and all stocks will once again have a weightage of 10% Time: 11:30 - 11:40 each and even the stocks in the index may change depending on how much weightage they have in the nifty50 itself now in sip in the Nifty top 10 equal weight index has generated a return of 15.2% over any 5year period on Time: 11:40 - 11:50 a rolling basis higher than that of the Nifty is 12.5% and at the same time here's the best part it has given these higher returns while having a lower Time: 11:50 - 12:00 standard deviation of 3.99 versus nifty50 is 4.39 and even though this index was only officially launched recently its verified back tested data Time: 12:00 - 12:10 from the National Stock Exchange has been available from March 2006 let's quickly go through the returns of the top 10 equal weight index versus the nifty50 and you would notice that the Time: 12:10 - 12:20 top 10 equal weight index has actually performed better than the nifty50 almost every single single time what's very Time: 12:20 - 12:30 interesting to note is that during the covid crash the nifty50 was down minus 4.4% on a 5year annualized basis for an sip whereas the Nifty top 10 equal Time: 12:30 - 12:40 weight index was positive a marginal positive return but that just tells you that it is much better at absorbing shocks when the markets are not doing Time: 12:40 - 12:50 well which is also by the way translated in the standard deviation that I shared with you the fifth factor is the Nifty 500 value 50 index that has generated wait for it I've kept the best for the Time: 12:50 - 13:00 last 86.2% returns in the past 1 year this index follows the value style of investing and it looks at a company's fundamentals it has 50 stocks in it Time: 13:00 - 13:10 selected from a universe of 500 stocks and each of these 500 stocks is assigned a value score which is based on the earnings to price ratio the book value Time: 13:10 - 13:20 to price ratio the sales to price ratio and the dividend yield this index is once again rebalanced every 6 months and it's current top Holdings include OMC Time: 13:20 - 13:30 ntpc and coal India and sip in this particular index has generated a return of 16% higher than the Nifty 500's 13.9% Time: 13:30 - 13:40 on a 5year rolling basis but the value index is standard deviation is very high at 13.1% versus Nifty 500's Time: 13:40 - 13:50 5.29% now value style of investing is generally considered safer and is traditionally known to perform well when the stock market is not doing well let's see if that holds true in the Time: 13:50 - 14:00 Indian context as well so here you go the value index and the Nifty 500 Index have performed well at different points of time and they have beaten each other Time: 14:00 - 14:10 at different points of time if you notice the covid crash once again believe it or not the value index fell byus 20% that was its 5year annualized return whereas the nift 500 Index was Time: 14:10 - 14:20 only down minus 5% so it's much more volatile as again seen in the standard deviation but there have been times when the value index has done well so just Time: 14:20 - 14:30 before the covid crash the 5ye period before that then the early 2010s and even the past 2 to 3 years I would want stocks based on the value style of Time: 14:30 - 14:40 investing in my portfolio but I would aim to get that exposure through actively manage funds rather than an index fund that's it for today I hope you like this video subscribe to the Time: 14:40 -

01:10 you had started it one year ago today it would have grown to 1ak 29,5 rupees if you had gotten an annual return of 14% which is roughly the Time: 01:10 - 01:20 historical Return of the Indian stock market for a diversified portfolio but think about it you have invested 1.2 lakhs in 12 months through an Sip and after one whole year it has only grown Time: 01:20 - 01:30 by 9,51 rupees even if your investment had grown by 25% in just one year which is extremely high by the way it would have Time: 01:30 - 01:40 become 1 37,58736 Time: 01:40 - 01:50 ,000 then with a 1 portfolio the same 14% growth adds 14 lakhs in one year and here's the best part the effort required Time: 02:00 - 02:10 for your 1 lakh investment to grow by 14,000 is the same that is needed for your one portfolio to grow by 14 lakhs that's why once you hit one CR in Time: 02:10 - 02:20 Investments you're in a totally different League that's why early on with less money invested even large returns don't significantly change the Time: 02:20 - 02:30 value of your Investments you may not be happy with the returns of a new sip that You' have started initially simply because you don't have much money invested now the same 10,000 per month Time: 02:30 - 02:40 sip 5 years later at a 10% annual Step Up would have grown to 10.36 lakhs so in year six if the market moves by 10% you now adding over 1 lakh rupees a much Time: 02:40 - 02:50 much more meaningful growth than the 9,500 OD rupees in year one the second reason why reaching one CR changes every Time: 02:50 - 03:00 thing is because of the magic of compound interest so a 10,000 per month sip growing at 14% annually at a 10% Step Up reaches one CR in its 15th year Time: 03:00 - 03:10 now guess how much time it takes for the next cor to be added definitely not that long in fact the same sip will hit 2 cres in year 19 that is in about 4 years Time: 03:10 - 03:20 and then in a little over 2 years that will again increase by 1 CR to 3 cror in total and five years after that your Time: 03:20 - 03:30 three CR itself has more than doubled to 6.6 CR and in 3 years after that you go past 10 crores in your portfolio value Time: 03:30 - 03:40 and then your wealth grows almost 10 times to go beyond 100 crores in only the next 15 years so the first CR took about 15 years and for the portfolio to Time: 03:40 - 03:50 grow from 10 to 100 crores it has again taken 15 years just notice how wealth creation absolutely explodes after you Time: 03:50 - 04:00 reach 1 CR that's all thanks to the big base that gets created as the year role and as you keep investing money and because of that same large base in year 30 when your portfolio is at about 125 Time: 04:00 - 04:10 crores you add 1.75 crores in one year alone if the portfolio grows at 14% think back again to how much time it Time: 04:10 - 04:20 took to get to 1.75 CR from zero almost 19 long years but later on because of the magic of compound in it only takes Time: 04:20 - 04:30 one year the third reason why your wealth skyrockets after you hit 1 CR is because now you're actually earning money while you sleep that sounds too Time: 04:30 - 04:40 good to be true so hear me out if you have one CR invested and that investment Grows by 10% in one year you now have an extra 10 lakh Rupees that year at that Time: 04:40 - 04:50 same time if your income from your job is 30 laks per year then the 10 lakhs you make through Investments is if you think about it 30% or 1/3 of of your salary which is absolutely crazy because Time: 04:50 - 05:00 to earn that 30 lakhs through your job you're working between 8 and 10 hours a day at least 5 days a week but for your network to go up by 10 lakhs you're Time: 05:00 - 05:10 literally not doing anything except staying invested which is actually a difficult part which has its own challenges but soon there will come a point when your Investment Portfolio is Time: 05:10 - 05:20 going to go up by a much larger amount than your actual salary one more big benefit here is taxation because your earned income can be taxed as high as Time: 05:20 - 05:30 30% if we don't consider sarch charges and taxes for the super rich whereas with your mutual fund portfolio that invests in stocks you do not have to pay Time: 05:30 - 05:40 any taxes if you don't sell your Investments while they keep growing and even at the time that you want to sell them the taxation is much lower in fact it's as low as 10% of the profit that Time: 05:40 - 05:50 you have made where is 30% where is 10% the difference is huge for example if you sell 10 lakhs of profit from your mutual fund portfolio then you get get your first lakh taxfree every Financial Time: 05:50 - 06:00 year so now only 9 lakhs of gain is considered and you have to pay a capital gain tax of 10% of 9 lakhs which is Time: 06:00 - 06:10 90,000 rupees if that same income was earned through your job that additional 10 lakhs would be taxed at 30% so you'd have to pay a tax of 3 lakhs the fourth Time: 06:10 - 06:20 reason why reaching one changes everything is because now you have learned how to control your mind and your decisions which may sound too philosophic and not really helpful but Time: 06:20 - 06:30 it's huge so just stay with me for a second just think about it if you don't have a large inheritance reaching 1 CR is a huge milestone it takes a lot of Time: 06:30 - 06:40 time to get there to give you an idea even a larger sip of 25,000 per month that has a 10% annual step up even with that you'll take more than 10 years to Time: 06:40 - 06:50 reach 1 CR so if you think about it during all that time when you're investing this money you're actually becoming more and more disciplined and that's not at all easy especially in Time: 06:50 - 07:00 today's world where it's so common to buy things on Emi just because it's so easy and constantly get bombarded with ads that push you to buy things that you don't need so to keep investing 25,000 Time: 07:00 - 07:10 per month and religiously increase it as your income goes up takes a lot of mental strength and discipline and the reward for that is an eight figure Time: 07:10 - 07:20 portfolio of 1 CR Rupees at the same time you have seen now how the stock market behaves during different times you know how it can crash 30 % in a Time: 07:20 - 07:30 matter of a few months or how it can even double your money in some other years or how it can even bore you to death by staying constant for a few years that's why when you hit your first Time: 07:30 - 07:40 cor it's now much easier to stay disciplined and keep investing as your portfolio grows from there on in investing conquering your mind and fears Time: 07:40 - 07:50 which very few people talk about is a huge part of the game and getting to your first cor is the best training to come out with notorious so now that you Time: 07:50 - 08:00 know that your financial life actually changes when you hit one CR how can you actually get there I'm going to share with you two easy strategies the first is maximizing how much money you can Time: 08:00 - 08:10 invest now I see this happening all the time when I'm talking to people about their Investments people are severely underinvested compared to how much they Time: 08:10 - 08:20 can invest so some people have a surplus of 25,000 rupees every month but they only invest 10,000 rupees others have a surplus of about 50,000 r and are only Time: 08:20 - 08:30 investing 20,000 rupees and it can also be seen with smaller amounts when someone has 5,000 rupees left at the end of each month but they're only investing 1,000 rupees whereas they can invest Time: 08:30 - 08:40 much higher amounts now what I'm about to say may seem like the dumbest thing to say but the more money you invest the quicker you will get to 1 CR rupees let Time: 08:40 - 08:50 me share an example as to how you even a small change to your sip amount can have a massive difference 10 15 20 years down the line so here you go a 10,000 per Time: 08:50 - 09:00 month sip growing at 14% annually with a 10% annual Step Up in its 15th year reaches 1 CR now let's increase that Time: 09:00 - 09:10 amount to 11,000 so just 10 more per and see how that changes the value at the end of 15 years now it has moved to 1.12 Time: 09:10 - 09:20 cres so you know 1,000 rupee difference adds 10 lakhs in just 15 years and if I move this to say 30 years you'll see the difference will be even more staish an 11,000 rupe sip grow to about Time: 09:20 - 09:30 13.75 crores whereas now if I change this to a 10,000 rupee sip that becomes 12 cr50 lakhs so the difference of that Time: 09:30 - 09:40 extra 1,000 rupees that you started investing 30 years ago is 1.25 crores which is not at all a small amount Time: 09:40 - 09:50 that's why invest as much as you can and don't hold back have an emergency fund so that in case you need money for your shorter term goals or R any emergencies you can always dip into that but for Time: 09:50 - 10:00 your long-term goals set to maximize your investing moving on to the second way you can save your first cor faster for that I'm going to share with you two Charlie Munger quotes Charlie Munger for Time: 10:00 - 10:10 those of you who don't know was an investing Legend and Warren Buffett's right-hand man his first quote goes something like this Charlie said in my whole life I have known no wise people Time: 10:10 - 10:20 who did not read all the time none zero look at how much emphasis is going into read reading and learning new things and Time: 10:20 - 10:30 his second quote which is amongst my favorite ones from him is about successful people and the common trades they share Charlie said I constantly see Time: 10:30 - 10:40 people rise in life who are not the smartest sometimes not even the most diligent but they are learning machines they go to bed every night a little Time: 10:40 - 10:50 wiser than they were when they got up and boy does that help particularly when you have a long way ahead of you at its scoree at its heart if you think about about it the second strategy is all Time: 10:50 - 11:00 about constant learning this could be targeted learning about the field that you're working in it could also be something totally different about something that you want to get better at Time: 11:00 - 11:10 or it could even be pursuing your own Curiosities which may not help right away but then remember what Steve Jobs said that the dots will connect when you look backward it will all make sense Time: 11:10 - 11:20 when you mix and match your various Curiosities and interests and build a space of your own I'll share my own personal story here so before I turn 23 I had written two Thriller novels gotten Time: 11:20 - 11:30 licensed in financial services in India and had started a podcast of my own which had about eight episodes now at that time I would have no way thought Time: 11:30 - 11:40 that today when I'm 29 years old I would be making educational personal finance videos online but all those skills kind of tied in together the Thriller novel Time: 11:40 - 11:50 writing made me a better writer which is today useful when I'm sharing all my thoughts and while I did not actively use my insurance license when I was a teenager it was a clear indic Dedication that I loved learning about the world of Time: 11:50 - 12:00 money and my podcast from back in 2018 and 19 gave me a taste of the world of social media so focus on constant Time: 12:00 - 12:10 learning and upskilling yourself because that just gives you more Avenues to earn more money and at times even earn money doing what you truly enjoy and that extra money then can fuel the foundation Time: 12:10 - 12:20 of your first K think long and hard about this video One K may seem like a far away dream but I wish you the very best in your Time: 12:20 - 12:30 journey to get there that's it from me today and I'll catch you in the next one Time: 12:30 - 12:40 My current portfolio is 4.5 cr.+ 2 flats.. no loan. I am 33 year old.  Targeting 15 cr by 2030.",

      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:10 wedding where should you invest money for your various short-term goals everyone keeps talking about the magic of compounding with mutual funds and sips in the long run but we still need Time: 00:10 - 00:20 money for various short-term goals because we need to live our life and pay for various things along the way so in this particular video I'm going to share with you six investment ideas for your Time: 00:20 - 00:30 short-term goals hello everyone if you're new to the channel I'm UD adad I've been licensed in the financial services space in India since 2015 and Time: 00:30 - 00:40 I've helped over 1,000 families make better financial decisions and through my YouTube videos I'm sharing all my years of experience so first up let's say you need money in the next 3 to 4 Time: 00:40 - 00:50 years I will walk you through an example of buying a car but it could really be anything so let's say you need 5 lakh save for the down payment of that car now I'll enter 5 LH in my master Time: 00:50 - 01:00 financial calculator which by the way you can get for free using the link below the like button so we need 5 lakhs in 4 years and let's say the inflation Time: 01:00 - 01:10 is about 8% now in that case the inflation adjusted value is 6.8 lakhs and in order to get there you have to invest about 12,250 rupees I have Time: 01:10 - 01:20 assumed a 7% return here let's say move it to 9% and in that case you need about now 11,700 rupees saved every month but where should you invest this are stocks Time: 01:20 - 01:30 or Equity mutual funds a good idea ideally no because the chances of losing money are higher when you're investing in the stock market for a shorter period Time: 01:30 - 01:40 like 3 to 4 years this risk of investing in stocks goes down with longer time frames in fact let me share with you a few numbers around this the Indian stock Time: 01:40 - 01:50 market has given annual returns of under 8% over any threeyear period since 1999 about 35% of the time and out of that you would have actually lost money 30% Time: 01:50 - 02:00 of the time over a 3E period and I've considered an 8% return here since that's what other safe instruments would have given over a 3 to 4 year period and knowing about the chances of these negative returns is super important I Time: 02:00 - 02:10 mean just imagine you're saving for the down payment of a house and you need let's say 20 lakh rupees for it so you invest that in the stock market thinking that it will be 20 lakhs or higher but Time: 02:10 - 02:20 when you actually need that money the stock market is low and now instead of 20 lakhs you have about 15 lakhs that's what actually happened in the Indian stock market in the early 2000s when the Time: 02:20 - 02:30 stock market's three-year return was- 18.5% so I'm going to share two better investing ideas with you for your shortterm goals between 3 to four years Time: 02:30 - 02:40 the first is an equity savings mutual fund it's a type of a mutual fund as you can tell that invests in stocks bonds and Arbitrage opportunities it does Time: 02:40 - 02:50 invest in stocks yes but the allocation to them is very low so even if stocks are volatile and risky in the short run the bonds and Arbitrage investing May makes These funds safe the average Time: 02:50 - 03:00 three-year rolling Return of the five largest funds in this space is 11.8% let me show you the portfolio of the icsi credential Equity savings fund Time: 03:00 - 03:10 which is the largest mutual fund in this particular space so you'd see it's investing across different assets where about 20 19 20% is in equities 15 odd Time: 03:10 - 03:20 per is in debt a very small amount in real estate as well but a lot of the money more than 60% is in cash or cash equivalence which which means it could be holding just cash that is not yet Time: 03:20 - 03:30 invested or it could also be holding Arbitrage opportunities in this fund now this fund has generated returns of more than 11% in the past one year and if we Time: 03:30 - 03:40 say zoom out the over a three-year period the annual return is about 9% and over 5 years about 8.7% but then if you notice during the covid crash this fund Time: 03:40 - 03:50 actually dropped in value so can Equity savings funds give negative returns let me again put this in numbers since 199 8 Time: 03:50 - 04:00 you would have gotten negative returns in equity saving funds on two occasions the first time was during theom bubble crash in the early 2000s when these funds fell by about 1% and the second Time: 04:00 - 04:10 time was during the covid crash of 2020 when they were down by about 4% for 1 month now it's important to know that these Falls were much lower than the overall stock market's fall which fell Time: 04:10 - 04:20 by about 50% in 2001 and almost 40% in 2020 so while these funds don't offer fixed returns they carry a minimal risk Time: 04:20 - 04:30 for an investment over 3 to 4 years that's why you can consider them if you're okay with handling that slight volatility and I personally like the equity savings funds from IC credential Time: 04:30 - 04:40 HDFC kotak and tataa you can also consider a conservative hybrid fund for a goal that is about 3 to four years away this kind of a fund invests about Time: 04:40 - 04:50 10 to 25% of its money in stocks or equities and the rest in bonds here the small allocation to stocks provid an Time: 04:50 - 05:00 injection of growth while the bonds add stability to the portfolio the average threee ring Return of the top five largest funds in this space is Time: 05:00 - 05:10 11.3% since 1998 conservative hybrid funds have also given negative returns two times over a three- year period just like Equity savings funds the first instance was in 2008 during the global Time: 05:10 - 05:20 financial crisis when these funds were down by about 1% but the overall stock market had crashed by almost 60% at the time Time: 05:20 - 05:30 and then in 2020 during the covid crash when they were down for about 2 months by 4% when the stock market had again tanked by almost 40% so once again their Time: 05:30 - 05:40 returns are not guaranteed but the odds of negative returns are very low over a three-year period and that's why it's important to have that three-year Horizon while you're investing in either Equity savings funds or conservative hybrid funds and in both those instances Time: 05:40 - 05:50 the fall was not a lot and it did not last for a long time now since both these funds carry a similar kind of a risk and return the where they are taxed Time: 05:50 - 06:00 becomes important while deciding which one to invest in it's important to remember that Equity savings funds are tax like stocks so you get one lakh of taxfree gains every year if you hold Time: 06:00 - 06:10 them for more than one year and post that one lakh you have to pay a 10% capital gains tax on the profit that you make and if you sell them within one Time: 06:10 - 06:20 year you pay a flat 15% tax on the gains that you've made conservative hybrid funds on the other hand have a higher taxation if you sell them within 3 years of investing the gains are taxable as Time: 06:20 - 06:30 per your income tax lab which could be very high if you sell them after 3 years the gains are taxed at 20% but after considering indexation which just means Time: 06:30 - 06:40 considering inflation first up let's look at how taxation affects the Returns on a conservative hibate fund let's say you've invested 1 lakh for 3 years and that has grown at 9% annually then that Time: 06:40 - 06:50 investment has post tax given returns of 1.25 lakhs as you can see the actual gain is 29,000 you pay a tax of about 3,000 800 on the other hand with an Time: 06:50 - 07:00 equity savings fund the same kind of investment made over 3 years would have post tax become 1.29 lakhs and that is because the tax that you pay here is Time: 07:00 - 07:10 zero because the total gains that you have made are less than 1 lak now remember this one lakh is across all your Investments so if you have sold any stocks elsewhere or mutual funds Time: 07:10 - 07:20 elsewhere that would be considered and if that is beyond a lack then You' have had to pay a 10% tax on this which is about 2900 rupees even in that case Equity savings funds are actually better Time: 07:20 - 07:30 in terms of Taxation for three plus year goals and that's why even I would personally invest in equity savings funds because I'm in a higher taxation bracket and this taxation bracket in Time: 07:30 - 07:40 case I want to redeem my money earlier also becomes beneficial now on to investment ideas for a shorter time period of anywhere between 90 days to 3 Time: 07:40 - 07:50 years so let's say you are planning a vacation in 2 years and you need 1 lakh rupees for it we'll again use my master financial calculator so we enter 1 lakh Time: 07:50 - 08:00 in our calculator 2 years to go let's keep the inflation at 8% and now we need 1ak 16,000 2 years later let's say you're getting an estimated return of 8% Time: 08:00 - 08:10 this time for that you need to invest about 4,500 rupees per month to hit that 1.16 lakhs now for such shorter goals it's very very important to factor in Time: 08:10 - 08:20 safety because there is no way that the money that you invested should reduce in value in that case I have four investing options for you the first is a good old Time: 08:20 - 08:30 fixed deposit safe and you know exactly how much money you're going to get for example let's check out HDFC bank's fixed deposit rates for a 2-year period Time: 08:30 - 08:40 so the 2-year returns are about 7% if you're not a senior citizen 7 and half% if you are a senior citizen it at times could be beneficial if you have a senior citizen family member to invest in their Time: 08:40 - 08:50 name but don't burden them just because you want to get half a per interest by having them pay higher taxes one more option that you have here is recurring deposits if you want to invest that Time: 08:50 - 09:00 money monthly and not as a lump suum but the two biggest issues that I have with RDS and fds are that first up the interest that you get on them is taxed at your income tax level so if you're in Time: 09:00 - 09:10 the 30% tax bracket you could end up paying very high taxes for example let's say you invest in the HDFC Bank FD which is 7% for 2 years for an investment of 1 Time: 09:10 - 09:20 lakh that would grow to about 1 L 14, 49500 but over over that 14,000 rupee interest you you have to pay 30% tax Time: 09:20 - 09:30 which means you are giving away 4,000 5,000 rupees just in taxes that's why your annual returns then drop lower than 5% so that's the implication of taxes Time: 09:30 - 09:40 they can eat into your returns big time so fds are a good idea if you're income is not taxable or you are in the 10% tax bracket secondly fds and RDS are not at Time: 09:40 - 09:50 all flexible and they're very illiquid so if you need that money before the tenure ends then you have to break that FD and at times even pay up penalty for Time: 09:50 - 10:00 breaking that FD having said that I am aware that there are a few now New Age platforms that don't have this penalty at all but you again have to register with them so that becomes an additional Time: 10:00 - 10:10 process then you can also opt for small Finance Bank fixed deposits where you get about half to 1% higher interest than regular Banks and they're safe since they're insured up to 5 lakhs under the depositor's insurance but I'm Time: 10:10 - 10:20 not a huge fan of trying to over optimize your Investments for small amounts or open new bank accounts just so that you get half a percent extra interest interest on an FD that's Time: 10:20 - 10:30 because the difference of that small higher interest is going to be negligible especially For Less Than 3 years in fact if you go to my master financial calculator and we changed this Time: 10:30 - 10:40 to 7% you would see that the total monthly investment that you need is literally less than 100 rupees whereas if this goes back to 8% it would be Time: 10:40 - 10:50 4,468 so I just don't think it's worth over optimizing your short-term investment interest so much now I personally don't prefer fds or RDS Time: 10:50 - 11:00 because they're very rigid and have high taxation to solve this rigidity and illiquidity problem you can consider even a highin savings account there are some special bank accounts that give an Time: 11:00 - 11:10 annual interest rate of over 7% on your savings account I'm putting up some examples on the screen but keep in mind that a lot of them require you to have a large deposit amount to get that higher Time: 11:10 - 11:20 interest instead of any of these I would consider either Arbitrage mutual funds or short-term debt mutual funds for my short-term goals under 3 years now to Time: 11:20 - 11:30 understand how Arbitrage funds work I'll share a real life example of an Arbitrage opportunity so let's say you want to buy apples and in the store next to your house you get apples for 100 Time: 11:30 - 11:40 rupees per kilo but if you walk 5 minutes away you'll get the same Apple for 95 rupees now there's a difference in price between the two markets so if you buy apples for 95 rupees and sell them to the store next to your house you Time: 11:40 - 11:50 end up making a profit of 5 rupees in the same way the fund managers of an Arbitrage fund take the advantage of price differences in the spot and the derivatives Market I know these are Time: 11:50 - 12:00 technical terms and I'll make a dedicated video on it soon to explain how Arbitrage funds work but because of this what's important to know is that Arbitrage funds have never given a Time: 12:00 - 12:10 negative return over a one plus year period in the Indian stock market and their average one-year rolling return in the past 10 years is 7.5% a short-term debt fund on the other Time: 12:10 - 12:20 hand is a type of a mutual fund that invests in bonds for example here's the ICA credential shortterm fund which has generated 8% returns in the past last year it manages over 18,000 cres as well Time: 12:20 - 12:30 now this particular mutual fund invests in various kinds of bonds the highest Holdings are government securities so if you notice you'll see the percentage of Time: 12:30 - 12:40 interest that is uh given by this particular paper and if I scroll down you'll see other private companies here as well by private I mean they're publicly listed but they're not owned by Time: 12:40 - 12:50 the government so LCC Housing Finance mud finance and again they have 1.64% holding in this particular portfolio in this category of short-term debt funds I like the funds offered by HDFC and ICA Time: 12:50 - 13:00 because they are very large funds and have been around for a very long time and the average one-ear rolling return of short-term debt funds in the past 10 years is Time: 13:00 - 13:10 88.4% now tell me in the comments if you want me to make a video on how to choose these debt funds and I will make it soon now given the almost 1% higher return in Time: 13:10 - 13:20 short-term debt funds than Arbitrage funds they become the obvious choice correct wrong because both are taxed very differently Arbitrage funds are Time: 13:20 - 13:30 taxed like Equity Funds or the way Equity savings funds we saw were taxed whereas profit from short- term debt funds is entirely taxed at your income tax lab to know how taxes affect returns Time: 13:30 - 13:40 I have made a handy Excel sheet which by the way you can get access to using the link below the like button so let's say youve invested 1 lakh rupees in a short-term debt fund and an Arbitrage Time: 13:40 - 13:50 Fund in that case the average one-ear return of a short-term debt fund is 8.4% which means post taxes if you're in the 30% tax bracket returns of 5 5.88% Time: 13:50 - 14:00 whereas in Arbitrage funds it's not dependent on your income after the first year there's a flat 10% taxation so in that case you get a return of 6.7% and have about 1.06 lakhs instead of 1.05 Time: 14:00 - 14:10 now remember if your if you haven't sold any Equity investments in one year this essentially becomes zero so then your post tax returns actually are the Time: 14:10 - 14:20 returns that you get for your fund so that's why I personally prefer Arbitrage funds uh we'll again just go through a couple of calculations of different tax la and till what point are Arbitrage Time: 14:20 - 14:30 funds more efficient so if you notice once again at 20% they're very similar so if you are in a lower tax bracket then short-term debt funds can be a good Time: 14:30 - 14:40 idea but for higher tax brackets Arbitrage funds would be the way to go and finally if you need money in less than 90 days you can still consider a short-term debt mutual fund if you want Time: 14:40 - 14:50 to really optimize and maximize your interest but if you want to keep things simple which I really believe in just keep that money in a simple savings account check out more resources in the Time: 14:50 - 15:00 description and I'll catch you in the next one Time: 15:00 - 15:10You will find so many videos about where to invest in the short term but the way he has explained in this video is really appreciated. It is important to know about how these various funds are taxed, Udayan You have explained it in a very brief manner. Kudos and Keep doing the good work . Thanks",

01:10 valuable asset which is your time that means less stress more freedom and the ability to focus on what really matters Time: 01:10 - 01:20 whether that's spending time with your family learning something new or pursuing a passion because at the end of the day if you think about it money is a to tool to help you live the life that Time: 01:20 - 01:30 you want so by simplifying your Investments you're not just growing wealth but you're gaining the freedom to live the life that you truly desire Time: 01:30 - 01:40 hello everyone I'm UD NAD I've been licensed in Indian Financial Services since 2015 first in insurance and then in mutual funds and so far I have helped Time: 01:40 - 01:50 over 1,500 families take better financial decisions and here on my YouTube channel I talk about all things money and personal development the first Time: 01:50 - 02:00 type of fund for a one mutual fund portfolio is an aggressive hybrid mutual fund and before we dive into it if you want to learn more about investing I'm hosting an exclusive personal finance Time: 02:00 - 02:10 master class on 15th September Sunday in it you'll get access to eight proprietary Finance calculators that I actually use while working with my Time: 02:10 - 02:20 clients and you may have seen a lot of these Excel sheets in the videos on my page you will also learn how to select mutual funds for your long-term goal go Time: 02:20 - 02:30 like retirement or also how to select investment options for shortterm goals like let's say you want to go for a vacation and for every Master Class registration I'll be donating one meal Time: 02:30 - 02:40 to three underprivileged schoolgoing kids in India spots are limited so grab your seats soon through the link in the description or the QR code that you see on the screen now let's talk about the Time: 02:40 - 02:50 first type of fund for a one mutual fund portfolio which as I shared is an aggressive hybrid fund now this type of mutual fund invests both in stocks and bonds as for sebi rules an aggressive Time: 02:50 - 03:00 hybrid mutual fund has to invest between 65 and 80% of its money in stocks and 20 to 35% in bonds now this mix of stocks Time: 03:00 - 03:10 and bonds makes aggressive hybrid funds super interesting you may think that having Bonds in the portfolio would reduce its return which is perfectly Time: 03:10 - 03:20 rational but what if I told you that is one big misconception let me put that in perspective a 10,000 per month sip with a 10% annual step up in the aggressive Time: 03:20 - 03:30 hybrid category would have become 4.64 CR in 25 years while in the nifty50 it would have grown to about 4.5 crores and Time: 03:30 - 03:40 the aggressive hybrid category has taken on marginally Lower risk while generating these higher returns this is captured in the standard deviation which is 2.06 for aggressive hybrid mutual Time: 03:40 - 03:50 funds whereas for the nifty 50 it is 2.17 this is also the safest investment amongst the five ones that I'll be sharing with you today now one of the Time: 03:50 - 04:00 reasons for the higher returns in the aggressive hybrid category is because of the bond exposure ironically people think bonds lower returns but because Time: 04:00 - 04:10 these kinds of funds have 20 25% bonds whenever the stock market tends to not do well the bond element in this portfolio tends to pull up the portfolio Time: 04:10 - 04:20 because the fall is lower so when the markets again start recovering it starts recovering from a slightly higher price point and because aggressive hybrid funds tend to carry lower risk than an Time: 04:20 - 04:30 out andout Equity portfolio they could be a wonderful idea for someone who's afraid to start investing in the market or a new investor let me show you the portfolio of a few big aggressive hybrid Time: 04:30 - 04:40 funds that have been around in the Indian stock market for a long time so if we sort them as for the money that they're managing the biggest Fund in India is the SBI Equity hybrid fund and Time: 04:40 - 04:50 if we look at where it is investing you'll realize how the split is between stocks and equities so if you notice equities 72.3 2% right now whereas the Time: 04:50 - 05:00 remaining is in safer assets that are non-stock Market related now remember uh in mutual funds fund managers can change Time: 05:00 - 05:10 how much money is in stocks or bonds so let's see what the allocation was like in December 2023 so back then Equity was 76.6% which was very high in March it Time: 05:10 - 05:20 was 75% in June a little under 75 and it is the lowest that it has been since December right now which is at 72 Time: 05:20 - 05:30 2% now in terms of where this money gets invested if you look at the stockh Holdings Reliance Industries has the highest allocation amongst the equity part of the portfolio followed by acsa Time: 05:30 - 05:40 bank and State Bank of India and if you look at the bonds in the portfolio you have got government bonds that are dominating the debt portfolio so you Time: 05:40 - 05:50 have got a 7.18% government of India bond that matures in 2033 a 7.3% bond that matures in 2053 these are the two highest EST weightage Bonds in the Time: 05:50 - 06:00 portfolio now let's filter aggressive hybrid funds as per the average three-year rolling return so if you strictly look at returns then ICA credential Quant and UTI have the best Time: 06:00 - 06:10 performing aggressive hybrid funds in this space and if you go by size then you have SBI ICA credential and HDFC Time: 06:10 - 06:20 that dominate this category the second type of fund for a one mutual fund portfolio is a flexi cap mutual fund now these funds give fund managers total Time: 06:20 - 06:30 freedom to invest across large cap midcap and small cap stocks just a quick refresher large cap stocks according to the sebi which is India stock market regulator are the top 100 stocks in Time: 06:30 - 06:40 India by size midcap stocks are stocks rank between 101 and 250 in terms of size and stocks between 251 and 500 in terms of size are small cap stocks now Time: 06:40 - 06:50 in the flexi Cap Fund there are no hard rules on how much needs to be invested in each of these categories so the fund manager can shift gears based on where Time: 06:50 - 07:00 the best opportunities are at any given time and that is the beauty of flexi cap mutual funds they are flexible if large cap stocks are doing well the fund Time: 07:00 - 07:10 manager can focus on them but if midcaps or small caps have opportunities and are showing potential for higher growth the fund manager can easily invest more money there and tap into that Time: 07:10 - 07:20 opportunity to give you an idea about returns uh 10,000 per month sip with a 10% annual step up in the flexi cap category for 2 5 years would have grown Time: 07:20 - 07:30 to 5.75 crores that's an xir of 14.1% the same investment made in the nifty50 would have grown to about 4.5 crores so the difference in returns is massive and Time: 07:30 - 07:40 it is possible because flexi cap mutual funds also tend to have mid and small cap stocks whereas the nifty50 only has the largest companies in India and here's the best part the flexi cap Time: 07:40 - 07:50 category traditionally has not taken on significantly more risk than the nifty50 and has a standard deviation of 2.32 let's take a look at some of the biggest Time: 07:50 - 08:00 flexi cap mutual funds in India the most popular one is the parak par flexi Cap Fund and it manages 75,000 plus scos it's a fund that a lot of people know about and we can see that Time: 08:00 - 08:10 reflecting in its AUM uh we'll quickly go to its portfolio and see where it is investing so in the past 5 years it has generated for a lumpsum investment a c Time: 08:10 - 08:20 year of 27.25 which is again fabulous in the past year it has gained 37% plus so if you had invested 1 lakh that would have grown to over 1.37 lakhs years where it Time: 08:20 - 08:30 is investing money its top holding is HDFC Bank where 8% of its money is invested and then it again has all these big names right power grid Corporation Time: 08:30 - 08:40 ITC Bajaj Holdings coal India maruti Suzuki and what's interesting about the parak flexi Gap is that you'll notice that it has some International stocks in Time: 08:40 - 08:50 it too you'll see her alphabet which is formerly Google Microsoft Facebook and it has a few other International stocks as well so it is one of these funds in India where majority of the money that Time: 08:50 - 09:00 it is investing is in Indian stocks but it has a small allocation also to International stocks for international diversification so you would see right away that even though this is a One Fund portfolio it has over 50 stocks in it Time: 09:00 - 09:10 and you're getting exposure to different sized Indian companies and not just that but you're also getting international funds exposure so it's well Diversified Time: 09:10 - 09:20 and that makes again because it's a one fund portfolio the risk of investing in it significantly less then you have the HDFC flexi cap and kotak cap as the Time: 09:20 - 09:30 second and third largest funds in India in this space if we sort These funds as per rolling returns then you will see quants flexi Cap Fund has done the best with 34.3 3% returns and then you have Time: 09:30 - 09:40 JM flexi cap and HDFC flexi cap at numbers two and three if you rank These funds as per threeyear average rolling return performance the third type of fund for a one mutual fund portfolio is Time: 09:40 - 09:50 a multicap mutual fund now these are a bit different from flexi cap funds because they have to invest in all three categories large cap midcap and small Time: 09:50 - 10:00 cap stocks so while the fund managers of flexi cap mutual funds can move money around freely between different types of stocks a multicap fund follows a set Time: 10:00 - 10:10 structure and as per sebi rules a multicap mutual fund must invest at least 25% each in large caps midcaps and small cap stocks that means you're Time: 10:10 - 10:20 spreading money across different types of stocks which helps both balance risk and reward years white could be a wonderful idea the large cap allocation can give you steady growth whereas the Time: 10:20 - 10:30 mid and small caps can give you that extra injection of growth that large caps may not be able to give a 10,000 per month sip with a 10% annual step up in the multicap category over 25 years Time: 10:30 - 10:40 would have grown to a whopping 6.5 crores which is an xir of 15% and that's once again much higher than nifty50 is Time: 10:40 - 10:50 4.5 crores for a similar kind of investment and this is understandable because multic caps by Nature have an inbuilt balance of large AP midcap and small cap stocks whereas the nifty50 Time: 10:50 - 11:00 only invests in India's 50 largest stocks and because multicap funds have a higher allocation to Mid and small cap stocks they have a standard deviation of Time: 11:00 - 11:10 2.79 which indicates more volatility than nifty50 although it's marginally high let's quickly check out the top multicap funds the filter that I've put Time: 11:10 - 11:20 here is that they should at least have been around for 5 years so you'd see there are seven funds that fit that criteria and the biggest one is nipon India multicap with 38,000 crores let's Time: 11:20 - 11:30 look at where it is investing its money so that we get a better idea in the past 5 years annualized returns of 28.7% which is fantastic once again the Time: 11:30 - 11:40 markets have been doing well ever since the covid crashed so you'll see all these fund returns being very very impressive in the past year this fund has done over 40% and if you go to its Time: 11:40 - 11:50 portfolio you will see a different kinds of stocks in it so HDFC IC Bank infosis Reliance these are the likely suspects because they're popular companies and then you have two smaller companies Time: 11:50 - 12:00 here as well that you may not have heard of but again that is the beauty of multic caps you get a bit of everything that is offered in the Indian stock market if we s funds as per threee Time: 12:00 - 12:10 average rolling returns then again npon India is the best performer followed by Quant and Mahindra manues multicap fund the fourth type of fund for a one mutual fund portfolio is a Nifty large midcap Time: 12:10 - 12:20 250 index fund and this one is actually my favorite from this entire list here's how it works 50% of the money in this particular index is allocated to the top Time: 12:20 - 12:30 100 large cap stocks in India and the remaining 50% to the 150 midap stocks in the Indian stock market so you're essentially investing in India's top 250 Time: 12:30 - 12:40 companies with just one fund and this index is rebalanced once every 3 months I love this index because of the mix of large caps and midcaps large cap stocks Time: 12:40 - 12:50 which are usually more stable and established help weather Market volatility whereas midcaps is where a lot of the growth could happen so you Time: 12:50 - 13:00 get best of both the worlds a diversified portfolio with the stability of large caps and in fact I had invested some money in this index for my niece soon after she was born 2 years ago to Time: 13:00 - 13:10 give you an idea as to how this index has performed again a 10,000 per month sip in it with a 10% annual step up over 25 years would have grown to 6.68 crores Time: 13:10 - 13:20 that's an xir of 15.1% and you see how it compares to the nifty 50 where your sip would have grown to 4. .5 cror and Time: 13:20 - 13:30 because this index has 50% of its money in midcaps its standard deviation that is volatility is also marginally higher than Nifty 50s at 2.58 again it's not Time: 13:30 - 13:40 very high but you should remember that when the markets are moving up and down that even this index will move a little more than a pure nifty50 index and right now there are only three funds that Time: 13:40 - 13:50 track this index and they're offered by edwise zeroda and icsi potential edwise in this space has the lowest expense ratio of 0.14 so that could be a good Time: 13:50 - 14:00 idea to consider and in fact that is where I had invested money for my niece but remember this is not a recommendation I'm only sharing this for educational purposes the fifth type of Time: 14:00 - 14:10 one mutual fund portfolio is a good old nifty50 Index Fund now this is one of the most well-known and widely used indices in India and for good reason Time: 14:10 - 14:20 because the nifty50 tracks India's top 50 companies remember these are the biggest and most established companies across various sectors in the Indian Time: 14:20 - 14:30 stock market so in a way when you're investing in the nifty50 index you're essentially owning a piece of India think of it as the foundation of the Indian stock market and while its Time: 14:30 - 14:40 returns might not be as explosive as midcaps or small caps you're getting a solid comparatively low- risk investment strategy while investing in the stock Time: 14:40 - 14:50 market that grows steadily over time and just because I said steady returns does not mean low returns because a 10,000 per month sip with a 10% annual step up over 25 years would have grown to 4.5 Time: 14:50 - 15:00 crores that's an xir of 12.44% funds from na'vi utti and HDFC can be considered if you want to invest Time: 15:00 - 15:10 in the nifty50 index and in my master class on 15th of September I'll be sharing an index fund selection tool and seven other Finance calculators that will make your investing life easier the Time: 15:10 - 15:20 seats are limited so register soon for it through the link in my bio now if you're only investing in one mutual fund there are a few important points that you should remember first up all these Time: 15:20 - 15:30 ideas that I've shared in this particular video have Equity heavy portfolios even the aggressive hybrid fund invests about 65 to 80% of its money in the stock market so while Time: 15:30 - 15:40 investing in any of these funds you should at least have a Time Horizon of s years if it's a onetime lumpsum investment whereas if it's an sip you Time: 15:40 - 15:50 should at least have a Time Horizon of 5 to six years because for lower time Horizons an equity heavy portfolio could be risky the second important point to not is that all the ideas that I have Time: 15:50 - 16:00 shared are broad-based investing ideas that means investing in a thematic fund or a sectoral fund or only in a small Cap Fund or only in a midcap fund may Time: 16:00 - 16:10 not be the best idea if you only want a one mutual fund portfolio because once again with just such a narrow allocation you are increasing the risk while Time: 16:10 - 16:20 investing and you may actually lose money while you adopt that strategy and lastly why am I a fan of a one mutual fund portfolio the the answer is Time: 16:20 - 16:30 simplicity so apart from saving time and effort a One Fund portfolio can stop analysis paralyses and can get you to start investing because if you think about it when we want to invest there is Time: 16:30 - 16:40 so much research that goes into where we should invest and that is great but after a point it's important to start taking action and then learn from that Time: 16:40 - 16:50 action and having a One Fund portfolio pushes you to take action because it is so simple that's it for today tell me in the comments which other topics you'd like me to cover in future videos again Time: 16:50 - 17:00 a lot of effort goes into making these videos so subscribe to the channel and don't forget to register for the master class and I'm excited to see you there Time: 17:00 - 17:10I've just begun learning about value investing, and I've found that many good stocks are undervalued despite their intrinsic value. If you had $200,000 to create a strong investment portfolio, which stocks would you choose for better returns?",

So as per the calculation on a  5% stepup the total corpus at\nthe end would be approx. 3.75Cr. Also dont forget in this total corpus at the end you need to pay\nthe LTCG-tax too.

      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:10 today there are over 2,500 mutual fund schemes so how do you select the best mutual funds out of all of these in this video I'm going to share with you three Time: 00:10 - 00:20 Index Fund ideas that you can consider to start investing I'm also going to share the advantages and disadvantages of each and even give you an idea as to Time: 00:20 - 00:30 which you should pick based on your Time: 00:30 - 00:40 profile hello everyone and welcome back to my channel I'm UD and I have been licensed in the financial services space in India since 2015 first in insurance Time: 00:40 - 00:50 and then in mutual funds and so far I have helped over 1,000 families make better financial decisions for today's Time: 00:50 - 01:00 video I'm going to lay down two ground rules first up these are ideas for your long-term goals so for goals that are let's say at least 7 years away and Time: 01:00 - 01:10 number two while I'm actually sharing mutual fund names none of these are recommendations use the information that I'm going to share to educate yourself Time: 01:10 - 01:20 then do your own research and even speak to a professional investment advisor before you start investing with that being said the first type of of index Time: 01:20 - 01:30 where you can start an sip is the Nifty large midcap 250 Index right now there are three mutual funds that track it they're offered by edel wise zeroda and Time: 01:30 - 01:40 icac credential and this is not a sponsored video by any means in fact none of the mutual funds that I would mention or the websites that I would be Time: 01:40 - 01:50 talking about are paying me to talk about them coming back to our video a 10,000 per month sip with a 10% step up in the Nifty large midcap 250 index Time: 01:50 - 02:00 since June 2009 would have grown to [Music] Time: 02:00 - 02:10 15.93% which is absolutely crazy when you think about it and I want to Time: 02:10 - 02:20 highlight here the magic of compounding because after the first year of starting this particular sip you would have invested 1 120,000 rupees and the value of that would have been 1.35 lakhs a Time: 02:20 - 02:30 growth of only 15,000 rupees and that may have seemed very low but as the years role you can see how investing for Time: 02:30 - 02:40 longer periods of time and being patient with your Investments would have started stacking up returns I'm going to dive deeper into this particular index in just a bit and also share with you which Time: 02:40 - 02:50 amongst edel Zer and IC credential has the best Index Fund for this particular category and why but before all of that it's important to understand what Time: 02:50 - 03:00 exactly is the Nifty large midcap 250 index and what is even an index fund now to understand index funds I want you to Time: 03:00 - 03:10 think of a Spotify playlist like for example the Bollywood 2000's love hits now after seeing its name and clicking on that particular playlist you know exactly what kind of songs to expect Time: 03:10 - 03:20 right or let's say you have a different playlist like the new music Hindi hits now in this one you can certainly say that you you would not find songs Time: 03:20 - 03:30 like or you suddenly wouldn't find them so Spotify playlist is a collection of songs with a common theme now just like Time: 03:30 - 03:40 that an index is a collection of stocks with a common theme it could be an index like the nifty50 index which is India's Time: 03:40 - 03:50 50 largest stocks or it could be the Nifty Auto index which has Indian Auto stocks now there are indexes that don't just have stocks but different assets as Time: 03:50 - 04:00 well but I will cover them in a different video now the Nifty large midcap 250 index has India's top 250 stocks where 50% of this index is made Time: 04:00 - 04:10 up of the 100 largest stocks in India and the rest 50% by 150 mediumsized stocks as per India's Market regulator sebi the top 100 companies by value on Time: 04:10 - 04:20 the Indian stock market are categorized as large cap stocks the next 150 are midcap stocks and and the next 250 are Time: 04:20 - 04:30 small cap stocks the Nifty large midcap 250 index essentially has all the large and midcap stocks of India together so by investing in just one such Index Fund Time: 04:30 - 04:40 you're buying all these 250 stocks in one go because the job of an index fund is to replicate its index 100% now on the other hand if you invest Time: 04:40 - 04:50 in a non-index fund let's say the parak parik flexi Cap Fund you don't invest in the same stocks as the index instead in Time: 04:50 - 05:00 it the fund manager in this case Rajiv Tucker and his team do their own research and identify the stocks they want to invest in and choosing such stocks requires a lot more time and work Time: 05:00 - 05:10 and hence actively manage funds like this like the parak parik flexi cap usually have a higher expense ratio or fee compared to an index fund so who decides which stocks will go into an Time: 05:10 - 05:20 index in the case of the Nifty large midcap 250 index it is the National Stock Exchange in fact let me share with you the top Holdings of this particular Time: 05:20 - 05:30 index where it invests money so you get a clearer idea so I'm on a website called ticker tape and as you can see I'm on the Nifty large midcap 250 index's Time: 05:30 - 05:40 page the highest holding of this particular index if I just sort this as per index weight is HDFC bank right now so 7.48% of the money in this fund if Time: 05:40 - 05:50 you invest today would go into HDFC bank that was followed by Reliance Industries at 6.38% so let's say you're investing 100 rupes out of that today 7.48 rupees Time: 05:50 - 06:00 would go towards HDFC bank and again you'll see recognizable faces right at the top right infosis L Andro ITC TCS and we can also see which stocks have Time: 06:00 - 06:10 the least amount of weightage in this particular index the lowest goes to Metro Brands which is 0.02% then you have new India Assurance at Time: 06:10 - 06:20 0.03% now I like this particular index because it gives you exposure to both large cap and midcap stocks in just one go the largest stocks in the realm of Time: 06:20 - 06:30 equity investing give you some sort of stability while the mediumsized stocks give you an extra injection of growth so you get a flavor of both in just one Time: 06:30 - 06:40 scoop if you think about it now which Nifty large midcap 250 Index Fund should you choose there are only three funds that track this particular index out of Time: 06:40 - 06:50 which two are less than Oney old now that makes a decision much easier the oldest Fund in this particular category is the edice Nifty large midcap to 50 index fund and that could be a good idea Time: 06:50 - 07:00 in fact I myself had invested about 1 lakh rupees cumulatively in September and October of 2023 in this particular fund and as you can see the current Time: 07:00 - 07:10 value of my investment is about 1.4 lakhs so the investment has grown over 27% and it's only been a few months Time: 07:10 - 07:20 which is absolutely crazy and honestly I don't take any credit in that investment uh that it has grown so much the market has done well the only right thing I did was to to invest money uh if you look at Time: 07:20 - 07:30 how much this fund has grown over a longer time frame so if you look at the 2-year return it's 30% annual return which means that Time: 07:30 - 07:40 roughly every 2 and a half years the value of your money in this particular index would have doubled if you look at the past onee performance it is even higher Time: 07:40 - 07:50 42.5 5% cagr again I don't think this is sustainable I personally would be happy if I get about 12 to 15% Returns on my overall portfolio over a long time frame Time: 07:50 - 08:00 about 10 12 years now the second type of index fund that you can consider investing in is a nifty50 Index Fund now the nifty50 index fund only invests in Time: 08:00 - 08:10 India's largest companies specifically the top 50 companies in India by market value and in fact that's how the index gets its name it is the most popular Time: 08:10 - 08:20 index in India a 10,000 per month sip started in it since June 2009 at a 10% annual Step Up would have grown to 13.8 Time: 08:20 - 08:30 lakhs in 2015 39.2 lakhs in 2020 and 85.3 laks in June 2024 now let's go to Time: 08:30 - 08:40 ticker tape once again to check out how this index looks like so in the past 5 years this index has generated Almost 100% returns that is if you had invested Time: 08:40 - 08:50 exactly 5 years ago you would have almost doubled the value of your money in the past one year it has generated almost 25% % returns so has had a Time: 08:50 - 09:00 fabulous performance and if you go down and look at what makes up and what constitutes this particular index let's go through this exercise once again where we look at the highest weightage Time: 09:00 - 09:10 first there's HDFC Bank Reliance Industries and IC Bank as the top three uh constituents of this index and the lowest are L&T M Tre HDFC life insurance Time: 09:10 - 09:20 where less than 1% of this index is made up by these stocks let's also quickly compare the returns of the Nifty 50 index to that of the Nifty large midcap Time: 09:20 - 09:30 250 index now in the first 5 to 6 years you would notice that the returns were very similar but then midcap stocks had a great time and that just boosted the Time: 09:30 - 09:40 returns of the Nifty large midcap 250 index and it took off which is understandable since midcaps have historically done better than large caps over longer periods of time what is Time: 09:40 - 09:50 surprising though is that the large midcap index is less volatile than the nifty50 index so it has less Wilder up and down movements we can actually Time: 09:50 - 10:00 quantify this by measuring the standard deviation of both these indices the large midcap index has a 5year standard deviation of Time: 10:00 - 10:10 18.2% while the nifty50 comes in at 18.97% the one-ear standard deviation though is in favor of the nifty50 now when it comes to choosing which nifty50 Time: 10:10 - 10:20 Index Fund to invest in the expense ratio and the tracking error of the index fund become the two most relevant factors think of expens ratio as the fee Time: 10:20 - 10:30 charged to you for investing in that fund now this expense ratio fee is the money that is used to run the fund that is paying salaries rent compliance charges among many other such expenses Time: 10:30 - 10:40 the lower the expense ratio the better tracking error on the other hand measures the difference between the movement of the index and the index fund Time: 10:40 - 10:50 now remember the job of the index fund is to replicate the index 100% so that's why even the tracking error must be as close to zero as possible now based on Time: 10:50 - 11:00 that I have compiled data of nifty50 index funds in India I have essentially considered funds that have been around for at least 2 years and they manage at Time: 11:00 - 11:10 least 1,000 cres of money so that there is some decent track record now as for this sheet you can see expense ratio in column C tracking error in column D and Time: 11:10 - 11:20 then the addition of both these in colum now ideally we want the addition of expense ratio and tracking error to be as low as possible so if we rank funds Time: 11:20 - 11:30 based on lowest to highest of that particular addition you'll see navi's nifty50 index fund coming at number one followed by bhan ICA Prudential and the Time: 11:30 - 11:40 others just to give you context as to how much of an impact that marginal change in expense ratio and tracking error has on returns I've also given you Time: 11:40 - 11:50 how much one lakh invested a year ago would have today been across all these funds so if you notice the range goes from about 1ak 25,4 9 to 1 Time: 11:50 - 12:00 12567 so the difference between the highest and the lowest performing Index Fund on a one-ear basis is not that much over a longer period that would grow a Time: 12:00 - 12:10 little more but if you're new to investing you can try to optimize nifty 50 Index Fund selection bases this tool but it's important to actually start investing without really worrying about Time: 12:10 - 12:20 these nuances at the beginning at least because getting started is important and then once you figure that out once you're comfort with it you can start Time: 12:20 - 12:30 focusing on the details also tell me in the comments if you want me to make more videos on how to select mutual funds I will in it dive deeper into Concepts like standard deviation tracking error Time: 12:30 - 12:40 expense ratios and share other metrics as well that you can use now let's move on to the third index that you can invest in and that is the Nifty 500 Time: 12:40 - 12:50 Index which invests in large cap midcap and small cap stocks you already saw how adding midcaps to your portfolio increased your returns what do you think an sip in the Nifty Time: 12:50 - 13:00 500 Index will look like since it has small caps as well the same 10,000 per month sip with a 10% annual Step Up started in 2009 would have grown to 14.4 Time: 13:00 - 13:10 lakhs in 2015 39.4 6 lakhs in 2020 and about 96 lakhs in June Time: 13:10 - 13:20 2024 now let's compare that to the performance of the previous two indices that we spoke about are you surprised by the result the Nifty large midcap 250 index is the Time: 13:20 - 13:30 best performer amongst these three indices in fact even it's fiveyear standard deviation or volatility is the Time: 13:30 - 13:40 lowest amongst the three now if you want to invest in a Nifty 500 Index Fund then the largest Fund in this particular category is the moila Nifty 500 Index Time: 13:40 - 13:50 Fund so that could be a good idea now the big question which one of the three index funds that I mentioned could you invest Time: 13:50 - 14:00 if I was starting out I would personally lean more towards either a Nifty large midcap 250 Index Fund or a nifty 50 index fund that is simply because as a new investor I may get a bit scared of Time: 14:00 - 14:10 the volatility that small cap stocks may bring and after I gain some more investing experience I would think of adding a dedicated small cap and a Time: 14:10 - 14:20 midcap fund now I'll make a video on how to select those as well very soon so hit the Subscribe button and I'll catch you in the next one Time: 14:20 - 14:30My mutual fund returns is 28% XIRR I hold one mid cap, one nifty 50, one small cap, one IT Index, quant tax saver, quant flexicap",

00:20 share nine signs that show you that you're on the right Financial track even if it doesn't always feel like that and this isn't just Theory I've been Time: 00:20 - 00:30 licensed in Indian Financial Services since 2015 and after working with thousands of people I've seen firsthand what really sets people up for long-term financial success so the first point is Time: 00:30 - 00:40 summed up perfectly by naal ravikant when he said a Fit Body a calm mind and a house full of love those are things Time: 00:40 - 00:50 that cannot be bought they must be earned it's one of my favorite set of words because just think about it good health is the foundation of everything Time: 00:50 - 01:00 as the saying goes a healthy person has a thousand wishes and a sick person only one so if you're taking care of your health that is exercising regularly Time: 01:00 - 01:10 eating right and sleeping well and long you're already ahead in the wealth game why because no amount of money can buy Time: 01:10 - 01:20 you a Fit Body and that's something that most people don't realize until it's too late in fact in India only 0.2% of the pop population has a gym membership Time: 01:20 - 01:30 significantly lower than a majority of the other countries and there is enough signs to prove that just one hour of strength training per week can lower the Time: 01:30 - 01:40 risk of dying from all causes by up to 20% and after realizing that I have been going to the gym myself three times a week for the past 3 months and it has Time: 01:40 - 01:50 been a superb experience I'm still new to it so still learning now one aspect that I want to improve about my own Fitness is my sleep and I want to a to Time: 01:50 - 02:00 get at least 7 and 1/2 to 8 hours of good quality sleep every single night then a house full of love now let's be honest what's the point of earning money if you're not sharing it with the people Time: 02:00 - 02:10 who truly matter to you a happy family and strong relationships are pricess they what bring true joy and fulfillment to life and you simply can't put a price Time: 02:10 - 02:20 tag on it and when it comes to having a calm mind let's face it in today's world it is so easy to get caught up in the chaos of Life notification deadlines Time: 02:20 - 02:30 distractions it's just a never ending cycle but a calm mind isn't something that just happens it's something that you work on over time whether that's Time: 02:30 - 02:40 through meditation mindfulness or simply taking a moment to disconnect now answer this question honestly when was the last time you spent even a few minutes not Time: 02:40 - 02:50 being stimulated by something that is no songs no podcast no videos running in the background just pure uninterrupted Time: 02:50 - 03:00 peace it's rare these days isn't it but finding those moments of calm can make all the difference both in your mental Clarity and does in your financial decisions which brings me to sign number Time: 03:00 - 03:10 two staying away from distractions now today's world sets you up to be distracted every single minute and usually it's our mobile phone that pulls Time: 03:10 - 03:20 our attention because of all the notifications that we keep getting undivided attention is an invaluable superpower Sophie Leroy introduced the concept of attention residue in which Time: 03:20 - 03:30 you're still thinking of a previous task as you start one more she explored how constantly switching between tasks is a huge productivity killer and a Time Time: 03:30 - 03:40 waster we all know about it already but wonderful to have signs back it up now one useful method that I have adopted to combat this is disabling notifications Time: 03:40 - 03:50 on my phone this way I pick up and check my phone on my terms and not anyone else's one more effective act that I have implemented is by installing an app Time: 03:50 - 04:00 called one sec and this is not a sponsored post by any means but it helps me reduce mindless scrolling on Instagram so every time I want to open Time: 04:00 - 04:10 say Instagram one sec asks me to wait for between 6 and 10 seconds then wants me to confirm whether I want to open Instagram and only only if I say yes Time: 04:10 - 04:20 does Instagram open and since I've started using one sec I have opened Instagram over 39% less times on an average day I got these ideas after read reading K newport's brilliant book deep Time: 04:20 - 04:30 work a few years ago which highlights the value of uninterrupted focus on a single task Newport says most people interrupt their work with quick glances Time: 04:30 - 04:40 at text messages emails inboxes slack channels social media feeds just in case something important has arrived by doing Time: 04:40 - 04:50 this you've put yourself he says in a persistent state of self-imposed cognitive handicap the flip side of this of course is that imagine the relative Time: 04:50 - 05:00 cognitive enhancement that would follow if you minimize all these distractions now I absolutely love this book deep work so I'm going to give away one copy Time: 05:00 - 05:10 to one lucky winner and all you have to do to enter this Lucky Draw is comment down below the like button which one of these nine signs that I'm sharing with you today resonates most with you now Time: 05:10 - 05:20 the best in the world today who have achieved financial success or or on track guard their attention with all their life life the third sign is about Time: 05:20 - 05:30 nailing the three fundamentals of personal finance these Essentials serve as a financial safety net and trust me they are absolutely non-negotiable the Time: 05:30 - 05:40 first one is health insurance you should have a plan that you own privately and not just rely on your corporate health insurance plan why is that because the Time: 05:40 - 05:50 day you leave your job you could be left vulnerable because now you don't have any cover whatsoever whereas a personal health insurance plan ensures that you're always covered no matter what and Time: 05:50 - 06:00 remember it's very easy to get health insurance as long as you're young and healthy but if you develop any critical life-threatening illness it's going to get hard to get a fresh new health Time: 06:00 - 06:10 insurance cover but if you have one from the past you can keep renewing it and even if you have claimed from it 100% you can still continue with that plan next up there is term insurance if you Time: 06:10 - 06:20 have any Financial dependents today or would have them in the next 5 to 10 years then get a term insurance that is 20 times your anual income it is the Time: 06:20 - 06:30 most affordable way to secure your family's future in case you were to pass away prematurely and finally the third and the final point in the fundamentals Time: 06:30 - 06:40 is having an emergency fund ideally you should have at least 6 months of your expenses saved up in a very safe place this fund acts as your buffer for Time: 06:40 - 06:50 unexpected situations that pop up in life whether it's a job loss a medical emergency or something else that catches you off guard and with these three fundamentals in place your building a Time: 06:50 - 07:00 solid foundation to weather life's Financial storms sign number four is not having foro or the fear of missing out while investing by acting based on your Time: 07:00 - 07:10 foro you're always thinking shortterm which is never a good idea for anything in fact Morgan howel the author of psychology of money said a lack of fomo Time: 07:10 - 07:20 has to be one of the most important investing skills and I would actually extend that to even spending money how many times do you compare what what you own to what others have whether it's a Time: 07:20 - 07:30 fancy new car that someone has bought or the pictures that they post of their latest trip to Euro it's very easy to believe that other people are doing much Time: 07:30 - 07:40 better than you whereas you may not entirely know the full picture now being in the financial services space I come across a lot of people who have been earning over say five six lakh rupees a Time: 07:40 - 07:50 month for many years and yet believe me there are people out there who earn that much but don't even have 10 lakh Rupees saved up they have taken on credit card Time: 07:50 - 08:00 loans personal loans to fund their lifestyle so the world outside may think that these folks have it all figured out whereas the reality is far from it Time: 08:00 - 08:10 people's lives that you see online on Instagram is literally 0.001% of what is actually happening noal ravikant in his very famous Twitter Time: 08:10 - 08:20 thread on how to get rich without getting lucky explains that the rich get rich by playing wealth games and not status games games now status games in Time: 08:20 - 08:30 case you're wondering what they are are games where you're constantly trying to one up others measuring success by external parameters like possessions or social media validation but what are Time: 08:30 - 08:40 wealth games they're all about building real value over time through smart Investments habits and patience now when you're playing wealth games you really Time: 08:40 - 08:50 stop worrying about what others are doing because you're laser focused on your own goals it's about creating freedom and Independence for yourself and not impressing others and that leads Time: 08:50 - 09:00 me to Charlie manga's brilliant advice someone he said will always be getting richer faster than you and that is not a tragedy the idea of caring that someone Time: 09:00 - 09:10 is making money faster than you is one of the deadliest Finance traps sign number five is all about the most powerful principles of personal finance Time: 09:10 - 09:20 pay yourself first it is the simplest and yet most effective way to build wealth and it's a rule that I I swear by Time: 09:20 - 09:30 here's how it works before you pay any bills whatsoever before you spend a single rupee on anything else you should invest at least 10% of your income and Time: 09:30 - 09:40 it doesn't matter if you're earning 30,000 rupees or 3 lakhs per month or 10 lakhs per month the key is to get into the habit of setting aside a percentage of your income for your future self Time: 09:40 - 09:50 consistently and 10% is the bare minimum if you can invest more money please go ahead and do that think of it this way most people spend first and try to save Time: 09:50 - 10:00 whatever is left at the end of each month but the problem with this approach is that there's usually nothing left unexpected expenses come up and before you know it your whole paycheck is gone Time: 10:00 - 10:10 let's break it down if you are earning 1 lakh per month and you invest 10% that is 10,000 rupees every single month without fail into something like an Time: 10:10 - 10:20 index fund or a mutual fund then over time thanks to the magic of compounding that amount could potentially grow to almost almost 1 CR assuming a 12% annual Time: 10:20 - 10:30 return now every month when we pay money to buy groceries order food online or pay any Emi we are essentially paying money to companies like Reliance Time: 10:30 - 10:40 Hindustan un liver HDFC bank and many others now they getting rich because of the money that you and I are spending so it's only fair for us to invest in these Time: 10:40 - 10:50 very same companies through something like a -50 Index Fund in fact n aora who's a CA professor and a wonderful YouTuber summed it up perfectly when he said it is every Indian's Birthright to Time: 10:50 - 11:00 invest in all these companies that we are making Rich sign number six is that you buy a car that costs less than 10% Time: 11:00 - 11:10 of your monthly inand income now I do understand that for many people who commute long distances have young families or they have to even provide care for older family members a car can Time: 11:10 - 11:20 be a necessity and if that's you then aim to keep the cost of this car under 15% of your monthly inance income and Time: 11:20 - 11:30 the reason you want to limit how much money you spend on your car is because cars are notorious for being the number one wealth killer because the moment you drive a new car out of the showroom its Time: 11:30 - 11:40 value starts to go down so it is a depreciating asset that's why by keeping your car purchase well within your income limits you're protecting your finances from getting drained by Time: 11:40 - 11:50 something that loses value over time sign number seven is that with your friends you talk ideas not gossip the conversations you have with your closest Time: 11:50 - 12:00 Circle play a huge role in shaping your mindset especially when it comes to money and success so if you're spending time with your friends talking about ideas like Financial Independence Time: 12:00 - 12:10 learning new skills business opportunities or personal growth you're already ahead of the curve and yes not every conversation with a friend has to be 100% productive all the time we all Time: 12:10 - 12:20 need a break and a laugh every now and then but if the balance is skewed too much towards gossip or trivial talk it can hold back from the growth that you Time: 12:20 - 12:30 want as Jim Ron said you're the average of the five people that you spend most time with and life is beautiful when those five people push you to grow Time: 12:30 - 12:40 encourage your Ambitions and challenge you to think bigger moving on to sign number eight and this is my favorite you're almost always learning something Time: 12:40 - 12:50 new whether it's reading taking a course watching insightful videos or just having meaningful conversations with people who are much smarter than you if you're constantly seeking out new Time: 12:50 - 13:00 knowledge you're on the right path the most successful people in the world are lifelong Learners they understand that the return on investment on learning is Time: 13:00 - 13:10 infinite Warren Buffett says that the key to success is going to bed a little smarter every day and it's true the more you read the more you build your mental Time: 13:10 - 13:20 toolkit to tackle life's challenges and seize Financial opportunities and the best part learning compounds which brings me to point number nine truly Time: 13:20 - 13:30 understanding the power of this mathematical equation if you haven't guessed already that's the formula of compound interest where p is the amount of money that you put in R is the return Time: 13:30 - 13:40 that you get and N is the years you are invested for now the most powerful factor in all these variables is n which Time: 13:40 - 13:50 represents time why because time in this case is raised two which makes it exponential so the longer you stay invested the more returns you multiply and it's important to understand that Time: 13:50 - 14:00 compound interest doesn't only apply to money it's true for everything whether that is knowledge building habits your health and even relationships and Time: 14:00 - 14:10 because n is exponential in nature the longer you do something the bigger impact it will have that's why it is so crucial to optimize for time so try to Time: 14:10 - 14:20 find a career that you can enjoy for the next 15 20 30 years so you can naturally get deeper into it learn things that you love because when you truly enjoy what you're learn you're just going to simply Time: 14:20 - 14:30 spend more time learning it and build relationships that support and grow with you over the years because with time they will compound in happiness and fulfillment compounding works everywhere Time: 14:30 - 14:40 so the sooner you get started the better your results will be and if you truly realize this and the eight other signs that I mentioned you are on the path to Time: 14:40 - 14:50 True wealth creation if you enjoyed this check out my video on why your wealth skyrockets after you reach one CR and I'll catch you in the next one Time: 14:50 - 15:00My outlook on money changed when I realized someone making $300,000 can retire broke & someone making $80,000 can retire a multi-millionaire. With the current market movement, you have $60k to invest. Where are you investing it?",
