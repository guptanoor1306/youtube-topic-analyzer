      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:10 long and here we have student B student B has a very calm 2hour study session they know exactly what to review how to review it and barely waste any time Time: 00:10 - 00:20 highlighting their notes or rereading the textbook come exam day I think you know who gets the better grade if you couldn't tell it's me by the way wait how I studied four times longer than you Time: 00:20 - 00:30 in this video I'm going to teach you how to study less and get higher grades so I graduated as the valid dictorian of my high school and I went on to double major at MIT and I'm not saying that to Time: 00:30 - 00:40 flex instead I want to provide some context so back in high school I took 11 AP classes peing at five my junior year and then at MIT I decided to double major pretty late which required me to Time: 00:40 - 00:50 stack up on a bunch of classes all at once so as you can imagine I had to be very efficient with my studying and the entire time I had to keep my GR grades Time: 00:50 - 01:00 up so my first tip is to disconnect yourself from the number of hours that you study as a student it's very easy to get fixated on the amount of time you spend studying instead of how you actually study and I get it right Time: 01:00 - 01:10 because it's very hard to measure the effectiveness of a study session but something like the amount of time you spend is a very concrete measure though it usually masks the true nature of the Time: 01:10 - 01:20 study session for example let's say I study for 5 hours now did I spend those 5 hours rereading my notes and highlighting everything I possibly could or did I quiz myself pretend to teach Time: 01:20 - 01:30 others and Tackle my weakest Concepts first those two behaviors would yield drastically different results all right so now that you're in the right mindset let's move on to tip number two read Time: 01:30 - 01:40 backwards this sounds really weird I know but bear with me this is a very valuable tip especially if you're cramming for an exam at the last minute so the night before an exam you're Time: 01:40 - 01:50 probably tempted to pull out your textbook and read the chapter the test is on but there's a problem the chapter is probably very long and you don't have enough time so what you're instead going to do to start at the end of the chapter Time: 01:50 - 02:00 you're going to start by looking at the chapter summaries and the key points and then work your way to the beginning and now that you're back at the start you're still not going to read the chapter Time: 02:00 - 02:10 normally you're going to do what I like to call a first pass you're going to look at all the headings all the charts all the bulit terms all the colorful boxes to get a high level understanding of what the chapter is about but of Time: 02:10 - 02:20 course you're still missing some of the key details so now you're going to do a second pass and no you're still not going to read the chapter normally instead you're going to go Section by section and read the first paragraph Time: 02:20 - 02:30 skim the body paragraphs and read the last paragraph So now after the second pass you should have a decent understanding of what the chapter is about but if you still have time to Time: 02:30 - 02:40 study now you can go back and read every single word individually all right and with that let's move on to tip number three batch your tasks so a huge problem Time: 02:40 - 02:50 that a lot of students deal with and maybe even you is something called context switching so for example the mindset that you have while reading something is different from the mindset you have while writing something which Time: 02:50 - 03:00 is different from the mindset you have while solving math problems switching from one form of thinking to another takes time something I like to call the transition cost for example let's say Time: 03:00 - 03:10 you spend an hour answering some brutal calculus problems and then you have to write an essay for your English class both of those tasks require very different forms of thinking it's Time: 03:10 - 03:20 probably going to take you a good 10 to 15 minutes just to get into the groove of the essay writing process so to save time while studying you have to minimize the number of transitions through a Time: 03:20 - 03:30 technique called batching and the premise of batching is very simple you're going to group together similar tasks and Tackle them together so for example instead of doing some math problems then an English essay then some Time: 03:30 - 03:40 science problems and then a history essay you're instead first going to do the math and science problems first together and then you're going to do the two essays this way you only have one Time: 03:40 - 03:50 mental transition instead of three now I use batching all the time in fact I'm using it right now once I finish filming this video I'm going to go ahead and film another one because I already have Time: 03:50 - 04:00 the light set up I have the camera set up I have the background set up if I were to film these videos at separate times I would just waste time taking everything down and then putting it back up oh and I have another quick tip for Time: 04:00 - 04:10 batching tasks once you batch your tasks you might notice that within a batch different tasks have different degrees of difficulty I always recommend that you tackle the easiest task first within any given batch this way it's much Time: 04:10 - 04:20 easier for you to transition into that new mental state that you might need to be in so for example if you bash together a bunch of writing tasks like write an essay work on a presentation Time: 04:20 - 04:30 and write a discussion post you should probably do the discussion post first because that'll take the least amount of effort and then you can follow this up with the outline and then the essay tip Time: 04:30 - 04:40 number four is to give yourself constraints now one of the easiest ways to spend less time studying is to give yourself less time to study and no I'm not being factious I'm 100% serious so Time: 04:40 - 04:50 there's an old adage called Parkinson's law that goes as follows work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion now this idea sounds fancy but it's simple however much time you Time: 04:50 - 05:00 give yourself to do a task is however much time you're going to take for example if you give yourself 3 days to work on an essay you're going to take up the full 3 days but if you give yourself Time: 05:00 - 05:10 only 3 hours you might be surprised to see how fast you can actually finish that essay so now while it's nice to space out your deadlines you don't want to give yourself too much time to work Time: 05:10 - 05:20 on an assignment because then you're just going to have the mental comfort of telling yourself oh I have hours or days or even weeks to complete this task and then you'll just work at a slower Pace Time: 05:20 - 05:30 now the easiest way to take advantage of Parkinson's law is to set a timer before you start an assignment first ask yourself how long is this assignment going to take then reduce that number by 10 to 20% and set your timer accordingly Time: 05:30 - 05:40 again you might be surprised by how fast you can actually finish that work so this technique is something that my apsy teacher actually used at the start of Time: 05:40 - 05:50 the school year he only gave us 30 minutes for each exam towards the middle of the school year he only gave us 25 minutes and then towards the end of the school year he only gave us 20 minutes minutes now Believe It or Not by the end Time: 05:50 - 06:00 of the school year most students were able to finish the exams even when only given 20 minutes I remember at the start of the school year he told us he was going to do this and we all thought that Time: 06:00 - 06:10 it was nuts but turns out he was on to something DeMarco if you're watching this shout out to you you helped me learn how to take test effectively all right and my next tip is to leverage AI Time: 06:10 - 06:20 now one of my favorite ways to cut down on study time is to use AI tools like grammarly who's the sponsor of this video so many of you know grammarly as a spelling and grammar tool but do you know that does way more than that let's Time: 06:20 - 06:30 say you have to write an essay you're staring at the prompt but have no idea what to write about this is where grammarly can help just open up grammarly and ask it to help you to brainstorm topics then tell grammarly Time: 06:30 - 06:40 what your essay is about and almost instantly it'll give you a handful of topic ideas oh and it doesn't stop there once you have your topic grammarly can also help you draft a research plan and Time: 06:40 - 06:50 even give you an outline now once you have the outline you start writing your essay and along the way grammarly ensures that your writing is clear and concise it'll check for common mistakes Time: 06:50 - 07:00 like passive voice subject verb disagreement and misplaced modifiers but it'll also analyze your piece as a whole and provide suggestions for cohesion flow and tone in fact with grammarly Pro Time: 07:00 - 07:10 you can indicate the exact tone you'd like to go for whether it's personable confident empathetic engaging witty or direct oh and once you're done writing you can also use grammarly's plagiarism detector to ensure that you can submit Time: 07:10 - 07:20 your essays with confidence grammarly is a must have for all students sign up and upgrade to grammarly Pro for 20% off using my link and now now back to the Time: 07:20 - 07:30 video so tip number six is don't idle and this again comes from an AP psych teacher so while you're working through an exam or doing some homework problems you are inevitably going to come across some problems that stump you and I'm not Time: 07:30 - 07:40 talking about problems that are just a little bit challenging I'm talking about problems that you legitimately do not know how to answer no matter how hard you try now the best thing that you can Time: 07:40 - 07:50 do in this scenario is to swallow your ego and move on and this was a huge issue for me back in school if I had spent 20 or 30 minutes trying to solve a problem I would feel terrible if I moved Time: 07:50 - 08:00 on without figuring out the answer but this ties into a psychological phenomenon known as the sunk cost fallacy now if you're not familiar with the sunos fallacy it is the phenomenon Time: 08:00 - 08:10 whereby a person is reluctant to abandon a strategy or course of action because they have heavily invested in it even when it's clear that abandonment would be more beneficial in other words just because you put a lot of time and effort Time: 08:10 - 08:20 into solving a problem that's going nowhere does not mean that you need to waste even more time in most cases you're better off tackling other problems first and then coming back to the ones that stumped you and this Time: 08:20 - 08:30 requires being comfortable answering things out of order so if you're doing a homework assignment maybe you answer the last problems first and the middle ones and then make your way to the start and if you're working through an exam the Time: 08:30 - 08:40 same principle holds don't ever feel compelled to answer all of an exam's questions in order unless they build upon each other just try to find a foothold somewhere work off that and Time: 08:40 - 08:50 then tackle everything else so tip number seven is to do mindless work first so there are two kinds of tasks you have fixed tasks and then you have variable tasks fixed Tas tasks are usually mindless work like working on Time: 08:50 - 09:00 flashcards or trying to find images for a presentation variable tasks usually require more mental energy for example writing an essay or brainstorming ideas Time: 09:00 - 09:10 for a group project now you should do your fixed tasks first and here's why so this bar represents the amount of time that you have for studying if you drop in your variable tasks first they're Time: 09:10 - 09:20 going to follow Parkinson's law in other words they're going to inflate and take up all of your available time and now you won't have time to fit in your fix tasks now fixed tasks on the other hand Time: 09:20 - 09:30 don't inflate like variable tasks something like create 20 flash cards is always going to take the same concrete defined amount of time so by doing your fixed tasks first you create a Time: 09:30 - 09:40 constraint for your variable tasks so when you drop them in yes they're going to inflate again but this way you manage to fit everything so this is a concept that's much easier to understand Time: 09:40 - 09:50 visually and shout out to my editors who I know have done an amazing job showing you how it works oh and by the way this is a concept that I came up with and have been following for years let me know in the comments how you feel about Time: 09:50 - 10:00 it and if it makes sense because I'm down to craft more productivity rules but I just want to make sure I don't sound like I'm crazy up here okay and the eighth and final tip is to tag your Time: 10:00 - 10:10 notes so students waste a ton of time rereading notes I have wasted a ton of time rereading my notes and this is usually because in the days leading up to an exam we don't really know what to focus on we just tell ourselves oh my Time: 10:10 - 10:20 God there's an exam coming up for unit 3 time to read everything I have about unit 3 but the reality is within any given unit there are topics that we know like the back of our hand hand and others that we're not super familiar Time: 10:20 - 10:30 with so if you want to spend less time studying you have to spend less time on the topics you're already comfortable with and that's why you should tag your notes during lecture while your teacher Time: 10:30 - 10:40 is speaking if they say something you're not too familiar with just put a star or some other symbol next to the bullet point this way when it comes time to review your notes your eyes are automatically drawn to the areas that Time: 10:40 - 10:50 you need to focus on now if you forget to tag your notes during lecture don't worry you can also do it after class just pull out your notes skim them as quickly as you can and tag any points that you're not super familiar with so Time: 10:50 - 11:00 that wraps up today's video hopefully you enjoyed it and by the way comment below to let me know how the school year is going for you so far are you enjoying it is it tough I would actually love to hear more from you guys and of course if Time: 11:00 - 11:10 you haven't already be sure to join the Discord join my newsletter And subscribe for more study tips Time: 11:10 - 11:201. its not about the hours 2. read backwards (1st,2nd,3rd pass) 3. batching (group and start w/ easiest task) 4. give urself a time limit 5. use AI tools 6. abandon old strategy if not useful (sunken cost fallacy) 7. do fixed tasks first 8. tag your notes like so i can come back to these tips btw guys this is not to REPLACE the video, rather to summarize",

      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:10 apparently half the students drop out after the first semester and homework assignments can take anywhere between 24 to 60 hours Bill Gates took this class Time: 00:10 - 00:20 and it's usually filled with former members of international math Olympia teams in other words some of the smartest math students on the planet I want to see what this class is all about Time: 00:20 - 00:30 I'm here to see who is actually taking it these are kids who were outliers in their High School how hard it actually is I say like math is really the only thing I do now and of course what Time: 00:30 - 00:40 actually happens inside math 55 so for the past few weeks I've been in contact with Joe Harris he's an Este mathematician working in the field of algebraic geometry and he's also the Time: 00:40 - 00:50 current math 55 Professor Not only was he kind enough to let me attend and even film one of his lectures but we'll be chatting with him after class my whole goal here is to understand what this Time: 00:50 - 01:00 course is actually like I want to understand how hard it is who's actually taking this course and what it takes to do well because here's the thing it has no prerequisites they simply say Time: 01:00 - 01:10 familiarity with proof-based mathematics is a plus and as former math 55 Professor Denny aru once said and I quote if you're reasonably good at math you love it and you have lots of time to Time: 01:10 - 01:20 devote to it then math 55 is completely fine for you I mean I enjoy math I took some pretty hard math courses at MIT but does that mean I'm reasonably good enough also do half the students Time: 01:20 - 01:30 actually drop out and do homework assignments really take up to 60 hours a week I mean that's more than a full-time job not to mention some people even say the course is a bit clicky among some Time: 01:30 - 01:40 math Majors taking math 55 is kind of like a status thing and apparently some students even come to Harvard just to take the class okay we're a bit early right now but the lecture is going to be inside that building right there the Time: 01:40 - 01:50 science center let's go wait inside now the science center is a special place at Harvard mostly because it feels nothing like Harvard unlike the Georgian architect and beautiful brick work that Time: 01:50 - 02:00 spans most the campus the science center is mostly made of steel and concrete this place is Harvard's undergraduate hub for Math and Science and it was only Time: 02:00 - 02:10 founded in 1973 and yes I say only because that means this building has only been around for 133% of Harvard's 387e history yet it's already brimming Time: 02:10 - 02:20 with some of the brightest stem mins in the world including Wan Jaya a math 55 student I met up with my first few weeks in the math math classes here it was like extremely difficult for me cuz like Time: 02:20 - 02:30 just simply because I've never done the proof before and I didn't really have any math background so it was like a lot of it was like self-doubt whether I could like you know succeed at math cuz like I've never been a math kid I'll be Time: 02:30 - 02:40 honest I'm pretty nervous right now and I'm not even taking the class I think it's because I don't know what to expect I don't know how big the classroom is I don't know how many students there are I just hope they don't mind me walking in Time: 02:40 - 02:50 with this camera granted I did get approval to film but since we have a couple minutes to spare let me tell you what this class is actually about so math 55 is actually two separate classes math ma 55A and math 55b the official Time: 02:50 - 03:00 title of 55A is studies in algebra and group Theory and the title of 55b is studies in real and complex analysis up until recently the class didn't really Time: 03:00 - 03:10 have a standardized curriculum the professors simply decided what they wanted to teach but that's been changing now bear with me I had to pull these quotes directly in 55A they teach linear and abstract algebra with a bit of Time: 03:10 - 03:20 representation Theory I wish I knew what that meant in 55b they teach real and complex analysis with a bit of algebraic topology now as I try to wrap my mind Time: 03:20 - 03:30 around these math concepts let's make our way to the lecture hall or lecture classroom I guess the first thing I noticed is that math 55 is in a pretty small classroom with around 20 to 30 Time: 03:30 - 03:40 students which is kind of funny because the actual enrollment is like 60 students now as the students roll in some go up to the professor to ask questions some are just chatting away but nothing feels too unusual or intense Time: 03:40 - 03:50 in fact Professor Harris looks like one of the friendliest guys I have ever seen but the stuff that he goes over not as friendly Time: 03:50 - 04:00 no there's no question as far as content goes as far as Pace goes as far as level of abstraction goes it's a tough course but it's not so bad today's topic that's not so bad is the cyer Von compon Time: 04:00 - 04:10 theorem according to Wikipedia this theorem expresses the fundamental group of a topological Space X in terms of the fundamental groups of two open path Time: 04:10 - 04:20 connected subspaces that cover X now I don't know what that means and chances are you don't either so here's a quick 60-second explanation courtesy of chat GPT so there's a field of math called Time: 04:20 - 04:30 algebraic topology and it studies shapes and spaces using algebra and this field is unusually obsessed with the number of holes and shapes this dut one hole this Time: 04:30 - 04:40 mug also one hole so in a sense topologist see these as the same shape because you can deform one into the other let's take a look at a couple more examples using Play-Doh here we have one Time: 04:40 - 04:50 hole again obviously this has two holes and here we have three holes now The Cypher Bon compon theorem explains what happens when you combine any two sh shapes it tells us how the loops and Time: 04:50 - 05:00 holes of the combined shape relate to those of the individual pieces of course this is a gross oversimplification the real explanation is a lot more advanced Time: 05:00 - 05:10 and it's almost indecipherable even for the professor if you look at the statement of Cipher Bon compa the general form of Cy Bon compa in monre I mean it's just to me it's impenetrable I Time: 05:10 - 05:20 cannot understand what he's talking about but in fact it's very easy to express in the language of categories and we're not getting the language of Time: 05:20 - 05:30 categories doesn't add any new results here it's just a way of expressing what Cypher non-confidence telling us and that's the beautiful part about this Time: 05:30 - 05:40 lecture he takes this obuse almost impossible to understand concept and makes it much more digestible by using a related concept quickly however the lecture starts ramping up Time: 05:40 - 05:50 B from Z to t such that V composed with v one is equal to V the diagrams on the Time: 05:50 - 06:00 board get more complex the symbols turn into hieroglyphics but Professor Harris's enthusiasm for the topic is infectious it makes it a fascinating circuit if we think of a star B Prime as Time: 06:00 - 06:10 the test object T we get an induced from a star B to that object even though the material has far Time: 06:10 - 06:20 surpassed what I learned and even the hardest math classes I took at MIT I can't help but stay engaged and the same goes for the students they're not afraid to ask questions are to be judged even Time: 06:20 - 06:30 as they're sitting among the brightest math students at Harvard there was a nice back and forth almost an open discussion within the classroom um big part of the course um I would argue from Time: 06:30 - 06:40 having spoken to professors and students alike is asking questions and not being afraid to do that but then I started to wonder who even are these kids who got up nice and early on a Wednesday morning Time: 06:40 - 06:50 to learn about some abstract math these are really bright kids even though a lot of the material is new to them or in some cases the way we approach the Time: 06:50 - 07:00 material is new to them they can handle it but why can they handle it what's the sort of background they're coming in with there's a lot of variation some have a background in competitive math Time: 07:00 - 07:10 like the olympiads some have been exposed to math in summer programs and some depending on geographical location Time: 07:10 - 07:20 are actually able to take uh university courses while they're in high school but not everyone here is coming in with such intense experience some of the students simply wanted a challenge and discovered Time: 07:20 - 07:30 their love of math in the process there's also the people who might have been attracted by the notoriety of the course originally but come to find um an Time: 07:30 - 07:40 appeal and a beauty to it for themselves on once they've experienced it and I found that this was exactly the case with M I was like not a math major Time: 07:40 - 07:50 coming in here I never really did like competition math experience I I have like no no competition math experience at all it's not like if you're like in Time: 07:50 - 08:00 like if you've never done a proof before like you're completely screwed it's like you just have to spend a little more time than everyone else does but like you'll get you'll get adjusted like a lot of stuff in this class is just like Time: 08:00 - 08:10 very elegant so this right here is a math 55 P set if you want to pause this video and try some other problems feel free now rumor has it that a single P Time: 08:10 - 08:20 set takes anywhere between 24 to 60 hours to complete I want you to think about that for a second 24 to 60 hours Time: 08:20 - 08:30 that's a 36-hour gap it's hard to believe that there's that much volatility between pets so I asked Wan for his Insight just strictly like doing the pets probably between 15 to 20 Time: 08:30 - 08:40 including like lectures and like just self-studying like the material mhm upper bound like maybe 30 like probably between 20 and 25 yeah clearly the pets Time: 08:40 - 08:50 don't take nearly as long as people say they do and students are expected to collaborate and then best of all the grading is very lenient okay okay so the grading is very lenient the pets don't Time: 08:50 - 09:00 take nearly as long as people say they do and the course has a collaborative nature so then why do half the students drop out well they don't that's just an Time: 09:00 - 09:10 outdated rumor the reputation might have been a little bit exaggerated over the course of the years and a lot of the sources that people were pulling from um Time: 09:10 - 09:20 were sources that dated back to the beginning of the course and so like any course um it evolved or the years with Time: 09:20 - 09:30 the students needs and with the way that pedagogy evolved itself especially mathematical pedagogy the rumor that half the students drop out comes from Time: 09:30 - 09:40 1970 back when yes half the students did drop out there's actually a quote from upen Professor David harader who took math 55 back in 1974 he said 70 students Time: 09:40 - 09:50 started it 20 finished it and 10 understood it but in the present day as of this Academic Year only 3.3% of math Time: 09:50 - 10:00 55 students have dropped out 61 started in math 55A and 59 remain in math 55b so then what was going on a few decades ago when students were seemingly running Time: 10:00 - 10:10 away from this course well first of all it used to be very different one of the problems we had with the course uh was that there wasn't really anything like a Time: 10:10 - 10:20 standard syllabus there were years when it was focused on one topic or another topic and there were years when it was extremely difficult ult than other years Time: 10:20 - 10:30 when it was normal and that's not a good thing you know if this is going to be the main introduction for a certain body of our math concentrators it should be Time: 10:30 - 10:40 you know more or less the same from year to year I think we're sort of gradually converging to that also students back then didn't have nearly the level of Time: 10:40 - 10:50 mathematical experience students have today summer math programs didn't exist the Olympiad I don't know if it existed but I certainly wasn't aware of it at time students coming in back then were Time: 10:50 - 11:00 smart but they didn't have anywhere like the background and that changed a year ago I asked you all what's your favorite subject in school and math was the most Time: 11:00 - 11:10 popular answer and then a few months later I asked what's the hardest subject for you in school math again was the most popular answer I think the same holds for these students math 55 is Time: 11:10 - 11:20 probably the hardest course they're in but it's also probably their favorite a lot of people say that the bonds that they form um through taking math 55 are Time: 11:20 - 11:30 bonds that last them through the rest of their time here at Harvard they come here and they discover there's actually not just one or two other kids who are Time: 11:30 - 11:40 like them but a whole Community MH higher education math isn't really about the individual and it's not even about how fast you can solve a certain problem to arrive to a certain specified Time: 11:40 - 11:50 conclusion it's really a community based field everyone's like extremely nice people are super kind if you're confused Time: 11:50 - 12:00 on anything like you can just ask someone and they'll like gladly explain it to you yeah it's super rewarding and the math department accepts you with like open arms and it's very nice is it challenging no doubt is it one of the Time: 12:00 - 12:10 hardest undergraduate math courses in the country probably but is it this Cutthroat ruthless unforgiving chor that people on the internet make it out to be Time: 12:10 - 12:20 absolutely not if you're interested in mathematics if you're motivated to learn mathematics and if you're willing to spend the time you can do this the sense of community both within the course and Time: 12:20 - 12:30 the math department is unparalleled these are some of the world's most Brilliant Minds working on some of the world's most pressing problems I think Time: 12:30 - 12:40 as a huge cohort of students who among whom are going to be the uh the leaders of the next generation of mathematicians Time: 12:40 - 12:50Who came here from the short 😂👇👇💯",

For one, Math 55 is solely for\nfreshmen.

At my time, I think there were around 6 such classes\n(19, 21, 22, 23, 25, 55). All of them more or less cover linear algebra and\nmultivariable calculus.

The class was more so a tour of grad level math through the\nlense of linear algebra... and I took it as a freshman. Homework took around\n35 hours to do for me per set, and I stressed a lot, but I made it. It was a highly\ncollaborative and leniently graded class as well. It was a 1 semester course.\nSo, it seems to me maybe other top unis just don't market their classes this\nway, even though they do offer them.",

      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:10 thinking and one of these exams the one that I'm most excited to talk about at the end of this video has a median score of zero in this video we're going to Time: 00:10 - 00:20 dive into each of these exams and what makes them so special we're going to look at the structure of these exams the kinds of questions that are on them and how students tend to do first up on our list is the us mle the United States Time: 00:20 - 00:30 medical licensing examination now I got stressed just reading about this one if you're one of my viewers who plans to become a doctor one day I applaud you Time: 00:30 - 00:40 because it is not an easy process the USMLE is a three-step Examination for medical licensure in the US in other words it's what you need to take in order to become a doctor now the US mle Time: 00:40 - 00:50 is different from the MCAT the MCAT is what you take to get into Medical School the US mle is what you take after you get into medical school and Tech techically this exam takes years to Time: 00:50 - 01:00 complete because you don't take it all at once it consists of three stages or steps as they call it most students will complete step one which covers basic Time: 01:00 - 01:10 science knowledge at the end of their second year in medical school they'll take step two which covers clinical knowledge during their fourth year in medical school and they'll take step three which covers patient management Time: 01:10 - 01:20 after they graduate usually during their first year in residency each of these steps is a very intense and lengthy exam Step One is an 8h hour exam that consists of 280 multiple choice Time: 01:20 - 01:30 questions covering topics like Anatomy biochemistry microbiology and many other areas if you're in high school I want you to Simply imagine spending the Time: 01:30 - 01:40 entire school day taking the most intense exam of your life got that cool now add 1 hour because step two is a 9-hour exam that consists of 318 Time: 01:40 - 01:50 multiple choice questions oh and in step two we're not dealing with basic science Concepts anymore now we're getting asked about things like internal medicine Time: 01:50 - 02:00 surgery and Pediatrics now if you're feeling tired I need you to stay awake because step three is an 18h hour exam that you take over the course of 2 days Time: 02:00 - 02:10 step three is all about applying your medical knowledge in the real world it consists of 412 multiple choice questions and 13 computer-based simulations to walk you through Time: 02:10 - 02:20 different patient scenarios let's look at some sample questions so this packet right here contains sample questions for step one and what you'll immediately notice is that these questions are long Time: 02:20 - 02:30 I don't think I've seen a multiple choice question this long in my life so this question right here asks you about a 14-year-old boy who's experiencing knee pain it gives you a lot of information about the patient and then Time: 02:30 - 02:40 it asks which of the following factors in this patient's history most increased his risk for developing this condition is it as BMI family history medication use previous fractures or recent Time: 02:40 - 02:50 physical activity and you'll very quickly notice that every single question has a very similar structure a blanky old patient comes to the office for these reasons and has has these Time: 02:50 - 03:00 symptoms lots of the questions also come with images and fair warning some of them are kind of graphic now step two questions look pretty similar on the surface because the question structure is almost the same but instead of asking Time: 03:00 - 03:10 about basic biology Concepts these questions ask about medical Knowledge and Skills now step three again very similar question structure but these are more geared towards the decision-making Time: 03:10 - 03:20 process in patient care on the screen now you can see some sample questions each of these three exams is out of 300 points in 2021 the average scores were 231 247 and 227 respectively and these Time: 03:20 - 03:30 three steps have surprisingly High Pass rates of 91% 98% and 98% respectively which I guess makes sense because these Time: 03:30 - 03:40 students were smart enough to get into medical school in the first place however if you want to hear about an exam that doesn't have as high of a pass rate look no further than the je India's Time: 03:40 - 03:50 engineering entrance exam the je is required for admission to various engineering colleges in India including the coveted iits the Indian Institutes Time: 03:50 - 04:00 of Technology more I looked into this exam the more grateful I felt for not needing to take this so the je consists of two parts je Main and Je Advanced if Time: 04:00 - 04:10 you do well enough on the main you'll qualify for the advanced and the advanced is what you need to do well on if you want to get into the iits so the main consists of three papers paper 1 Time: 04:10 - 04:20 paper 2 a and paper 2 b Paper 1 is required of all candidates and test them on their knowledge of physics math and chemistry 2 a and 2 B are optional depending on what you want to study each Time: 04:20 - 04:30 paper is a 3-hour exam that consists of multiple choice questions and numerical questions now je Advanced on the other hand only consists of two papers each Time: 04:30 - 04:40 paper is a three-hour online exam that consists of numerical questions and multiple choice questions that focus on physics math and chemistry so now how difficult is the je well to give you Time: 04:40 - 04:50 some perspective 1.5 million students take the main each year and only 10% qualify for advanced and then of the people who take Advanced only 25% of Time: 04:50 - 05:00 them qualify and get into an IIT in other words roughly 2.5% of the original test takers as former IIT Deli director Time: 05:00 - 05:10 Ram gopal ra once said the exam is tricky and complicated because it is designed to eliminate people or to reject candidates not to select them Time: 05:10 - 05:20 let's take a look at a few sample questions just to see how tricky and complicated it truly is first we're going to look at je Main and right off the bat we're dealing with integrals and you know as I'm looking at this I can't Time: 05:20 - 05:30 help but think about the dozens of people that DM me each month saying that the SAT is nothing compared to the je and now I see why for comparison let me Time: 05:30 - 05:40 show you the first math question on a practice SAT exam what is 10% of 470 now to be fair the digital sat is adaptive meaning the questions do get harder but Time: 05:40 - 05:50 this comparison is still hilarious anyways let's take a look at a couple more math questions we have some algebra we have some geometry we have some probability and actually let's try to answer this question right here A Pair Time: 05:50 - 06:00 of Dice is thrown five times for each throw a total of five is considered a success if the probability of at least four successes is K over 3 to the 11th Time: 06:00 - 06:10 then K is equal to what 82 123 164 or 75 I actually want you to pause this video and try to solve this problem yourself okay so first we have to figure out the Time: 06:10 - 06:20 probability of a success that is the probability that a pair of dice sums to five we can roll a one and a four a two and a three a three and a two or a four and a one that's for four possible ways Time: 06:20 - 06:30 out of 36 total meaning that our probability of success is 1 nth and our probability of failure is 8 9ths now let's call these values p and Q now the question is asking us about the Time: 06:30 - 06:40 probability of at least four successes so in other words the probability of four successes or five successes and to get that value We'll add the probability of four successes to the probability of Time: 06:40 - 06:50 five successes now to calculate those two probabilities we have to calculate the binomial distribution formula which I will not dive into here but if we simply plug the numbers in we get that Time: 06:50 - 07:00 the probability of at least four successes is 5 CH 4 * p 4 * Q + 5 CH 5 * P 5 which gives us 41 over 3^ 10 which Time: 07:00 - 07:10 is equal to 123 over 3 ^ of 11 meaning that K = 123 so the answer is 2 now we glossed over a lot of the math there but Time: 07:10 - 07:20 I just wanted to show you how involved these questions can get and that was just question number two by the way now let's quickly look at some example physics problems we're dealing with Time: 07:20 - 07:30 electromagnetism Digital Electronics fluid dynamics these questions span almost every major area of physics and same goes for the chemistry questions Time: 07:30 - 07:40 right on the first page we have Solid State chemistry electrochemistry organic chemistry these questions make AP chm seem not too bad and before we jump on to the next exam let me show you some je Time: 07:40 - 07:50 Advanced questions as well like je main this exam covers math physics and chemistry though as expected the questions are a lot trickier speaking of tricky questions next up we have the Time: 07:50 - 08:00 gaow whereas the je is India's undergraduate admission exam the gaow is China's held in June every year the galow is a 9-hour exam taken by 13 Time: 08:00 - 08:10 million high school students over the course of 2 to 3 days the exam focuses on Chinese math and a foreign language and students must choose between the Time: 08:10 - 08:20 Arts track or the science track the Arts track will further test examinees on History political science and geography whereas the science track will test them on physics chemistry and biology now Time: 08:20 - 08:30 what makes the gaow so difficult well unlike the SAT which has multiple administrations throughout the year the galow is only held once per year most Time: 08:30 - 08:40 Chinese students will only have one shot to take this exam unless they want to delay the onset of their college education like this 55-year-old man who has taken the galow 26 times and the Time: 08:40 - 08:50 scores these students receive directly influences the colleges they'll get into unlike in the us where we have a holistic admissions process meaning that admissions officers will look at the Time: 08:50 - 09:00 whole package instead of just test scores Chinese universities Focus just on the numbers so as expected this exam Spurs a heavy amount of stress and Time: 09:00 - 09:10 competition between classmates many students particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds see this exam as the only way to change their economic and social Destiny so how well do you Time: 09:10 - 09:20 need to do on the gaow to get into China's top universities well it varies by province because different provinces in China have slightly different administrations of the gal C to get into Time: 09:20 - 09:30 schools like peeking which is often touted as the Harvard of China students in some provinces need to score in the top 1% and students in other provinces need a score in the top. 5% so it's not Time: 09:30 - 09:40 a surprise that students spend years prepping for this exam let's look at a few sample questions now I'll be honest I struggled to find the English version of this exam so I'll start by showing Time: 09:40 - 09:50 you some questions in Chinese from the 20122 administration here we have some of the chemistry questions for students who chose the science track here are some of the biology questions questions and here are some of the math questions Time: 09:50 - 10:00 now I actually found some translated math questions but they come from the 2016 exam rest assured they're still similar to what students see on the gaow today let's read a couple of them off Time: 10:00 - 10:10 given an arithmetic sequence SN is the sum of the first n terms if A1 + a22 = -3 S5 = 10 then the value of A9 is what Time: 10:10 - 10:20 another question is in the figure below f is the right focus of the ellipse x^2 A2 + y^2 b^2 = 1 where where a is greater than b which is greater than Time: 10:20 - 10:30 zero a straight line Y = b/ 2 intersects the ellipse at points b c and angle BFC equal 90° then the eccentricity of the ellipse is what now some of you may also Time: 10:30 - 10:40 know the gala for its absurd essay prompts here are some prompts that showed up in previous years in 2013 some students were given the following topic it flies upward and a voice asks if it Time: 10:40 - 10:50 is tired it says no I'm not even joking that is the entire prompt here's another one from the 2013 beijan gaat how would Thomas ala Edison react to the mobile Time: 10:50 - 11:00 phone if he came to the 21st century no less than 800 words choose your own title now at least this one makes more sense and it sounds kind of interesting and now I actually found a copy of the Time: 11:00 - 11:10 2023 essays and used Google Translate to decipher the prompts here's how one of them reads people have better control over time due to technological development but some people become Time: 11:10 - 11:20 Servants of time what associations and thoughts does this sentence triggering you now if those questions blew your mind you are not ready for what's to come because we're about to cover the All Souls Fellowship exam I'm actually Time: 11:20 - 11:30 so excited to talk about this exam because it is unlike anything we've talked about so far so for some context the All Souls Fellowship exam is an extremely competitive and prestigious Time: 11:30 - 11:40 exam held by All Souls college at Oxford University this exam was actually once deemed the hardest exam in the world now All Souls only has graduate students and Time: 11:40 - 11:50 it administers this exam to search for its examination fellows these fellows get and I quote 7 years of research in ideal conditions in regular contact with Time: 11:50 - 12:00 leading scholars in their field and free from many of the pressures financial and otherwise which can afflict Graduate Studies in other words fellows get to pursue academic research without any Time: 12:00 - 12:10 worry and that too at the University of Oxford so what does this exam look like well it's 12 hours long it consists of four papers of 3 hours each two of the Time: 12:10 - 12:20 papers are related to the candidates field of study for example classical studies economics English literature history law philosophy or politics and the other two papers are General papers Time: 12:20 - 12:30 which contain questions on a wide array of topics let's take a look at a few starzing the super rich is not art it is shooting fish in a barrel discuss which Time: 12:30 - 12:40 aspects of someone's life should go into their obituary why never memorize something that you can look up is this good advice today no action or speech is ever truly spontaneous discuss and then Time: 12:40 - 12:50 finally how can Healthcare be funded I don't think I need to explain what makes this exam so difficult but you know what maybe these are just some outliers let's look at a couple other examples can Time: 12:50 - 13:00 objectifying another person ever be justified can an institution care an eternal life would be unlivable discuss how should we explain the notion of a biological species We Are All migrants Time: 13:00 - 13:10 Through Time discuss you know I feel simultaneously anxious and excited by these questions they do seem kind of fun to answer but at the same time where do Time: 13:10 - 13:20 you even start oh and by the way years ago this exam also used to have a one-word essay examinees were given one word and had to write an entire essay in Time: 13:20 - 13:30 response now let me show you some of the specialist papers here's the classical studies question I am honestly speechless uh but you know what let's look at some of the philosophy questions Time: 13:30 - 13:40 surely they can't be that bad are you a war stretching across a region of SpaceTime never mind they are that bad jokes aside 150 students take this exam each year of which the college will Time: 13:40 - 13:50 select two examination fellows that's a 1.33% okay so how does the college score these exams though well they don't or not in the sense you expect them to Time: 13:50 - 14:00 obviously the evaluation process for these sorts of questions is very subjective and the college says so themselves there is no single formula for gaining the fellowship the important Time: 14:00 - 14:10 thing is to write scripts that show you at your best bear in mind that you may need to allow yourself more latitude and ambition than usual in the fellowship examination some risks May yield Time: 14:10 - 14:20 significant rewards I'm going to let you think about that one now if you want to hear about another exam that will absolutely screw with your mind well you're in luck because next up we're talking about the putam I am so excited Time: 14:20 - 14:30 to talk about this exam because it genuinely fascinates me I've honestly thought about making a separate video just for this exam but why is it special Time: 14:30 - 14:40 what makes it so exciting well first of all the putnum is actually a competition the full name of it is the William LEL putam mathematical competition every single year 4,000 to 5,000 of the Time: 14:40 -

15:00 top five scorers are called the puam fellows and receive a cash prize of $2,500 and the school with the first place team wins a cash prize of Time: 15:00 - 15:10 $25,000 in recent years MIT has absolutely dominated the leaderboard I mean just take a look at the results from the 2022 competition so now what Time: 15:10 - 15:20 does the exam look like it lasts 6 hours and consist of 12 questions each worth 10 points these questions cover topics like algebra combinatorics G ometry and calculus now you might be wondering Time: 15:20 - 15:30 gohar I've taken algebra how hard can this exam really be well these questions require a whole different level of mathematical intuition let's look at a few sample questions here's question A5 Time: 15:30 - 15:40 from the 83rd putam Alice and Bob play a game on a board consisting of one row of 2022 consecutive squares they take turns Time: 15:40 - 15:50 placing tiles that cover two adjacent squares with Alice going first by rule a tile must not cover a square that is already covered by another tile the game ends when no tile can be placed Time: 15:50 - 16:00 according to this rule Alice's goal is to maximize the number of uncovered squares when the game ends Bob's goal is to minimize it what is the greatest number of uncovered squares that Alice Time: 16:00 - 16:10 can ensure at the end of the game no matter how Bob plays at very quick glance this question might seem a little doable but I looked at the results and out of the 546 top scorers only six got Time: 16:10 - 16:20 a perfect score on this question and 444 of them received no points okay but now let's look at at an easier question it's Time: 16:20 - 16:30 not easy but it's easier take a couple seconds to read that cool 288 of the 546 top scorers got a perfect score on this only 82 received no points go ahead and Time: 16:30 - 16:40 take a look at a couple more examples I think the length of these questions makes some of them deceivingly simple but once you start working with them they'll just mess with your mind now it is kind of fun to try and understand the Time: 16:40 - 16:50 solutions to these questions so just in case you're interested I'll link them in the description of this video and with that you can take a deep breath because we're done hopefully you had a fun time Time: 16:50 - 17:00 looking at some of the most challenging exams in the world let me know in the comments if you've actually taken one of these or plan to do so one day as always like And subscribe for more check out next admer for collegea help and I'll Time: 17:00 - 17:10 see you again next time Time: 17:10 - 17:20Bro forgot the \"I'm not a robot\" test",

      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:10 the neurotransmitter in your brain that's associated with feelings of happiness and pleasure while you're eating snacks watching movies or hanging out with friends your brain is releasing Time: 00:10 - 00:20 a ton of dopamine but when you go to your desk to work on some homework well it's not releasing as much the ultimate goal here is to trick your brain into Time: 00:20 - 00:30 releasing dopamine while you're studying but before we jump into that let's talk about dopamine itself I like to imagine that different activities in our lives give us different amounts of dopamine Time: 00:30 - 00:40 and we can put these activities on something I like to call the pleasure scale studying is all the way down here listening to music is probably here eating sugary snacks is here and then Time: 00:40 - 00:50 scrolling on your phone is all the way up here of course there are hundreds of other activities that can and do give us dopamine now before we discuss anything else I want you to ask yourself one Time: 00:50 - 01:00 question where is my Baseline dopamine level is it all the way down here is it all the way up here or is it somewhere in the middle because here's the truth Time: 01:00 - 01:10 the farther ahead your Baseline dopamine level is from studying the worse studying is going to feel to you but gohar what is a baseline dopamine level Time: 01:10 - 01:20 well think about the activities you engage in regularly the average amount of dopamine these activities release is your Baseline level so for example if you spend most most of your day Time: 01:20 - 01:30 scrolling through Tik Tok while eating candy and watching movies in the background chances are your Baseline dopamine level is all the way up here meaning that this is what normal life Time: 01:30 - 01:40 feels like to you so when you have to study which is all the way down here on the pleasure scale it's going to feel very painful on the other hand if you live a healthier lifestyle for example Time: 01:40 - 01:50 if you exercise limit your phone usage and avoid eating High processed foods your Baseline level is probably in a lower healthier range so in this situation studying doesn't feel as Time: 01:50 - 02:00 painful by the way this notion of a baseline dopamine level is not some precise measure it's simply a framework that I came with to assess my own behavior so now to trick our brains to Time: 02:00 - 02:10 enjoy studying there are two things that we can do first we can make the act of studying itself release more dopamine which in essence means moving it up the Time: 02:10 - 02:20 pleasure scale but there's also something else that we can do we can lower our Baseline dopamine level so this way when we have to study it feels less L painful and ideally we want to do Time: 02:20 - 02:30 both of these all right first let's talk about how to lower your Baseline dopamine level some people also call this a dopamine detox the first tip I Time: 02:30 - 02:40 have is to go on a 10 to 15 minute walk every single day no music no phone just you your thoughts and nature for many of us our phones aren't just a tool that we Time: 02:40 - 02:50 use they feel like an extension of our being I mean just think about it this way is your phone ever out of Arms Reach chances are you said no this dopamine box is sitting next to us 24/7 I mean Time: 02:50 - 03:00 it's sitting next to me right now the goal should be to bring this down just a little bit I'll be honest going on a walk without your phone is going to feel really weird at first because we are so Time: 03:00 - 03:10 used to holding our phones or having it in our pockets so when you first go outside without it you are going to feel like you're missing something but after some time you are going to overcome that Time: 03:10 - 03:20 feeling and it might even feel freeing as you go on these walks I encourage you to just sit with your thoughts to observe the smells the sights The Sounds because in today's era I feel like we Time: 03:20 - 03:30 seldom take time to observe the world around us tip number two is to implement a no screen rule for the first 30 minutes of the day and the last 30 minutes of the day remember you are in Time: 03:30 - 03:40 control of your phone not the other way around if you grab your phone first thing when you wake up you are implicitly surrendering yourself before the day has even started this sounds a Time: 03:40 - 03:50 little intense I know but my goal isn't to get you to abandon your phone all I'm saying is that you should give yourself the first 30 minutes of the day to stretch drink some water maybe regain Time: 03:50 - 04:00 Consciousness I'll admit there are some mornings when I grab my phone first thing and I mean first thing like before my vision has even kicked in and no surprise these end up being the mornings Time: 04:00 - 04:10 that I feel the laziest tip number three is to practice mindfulness or meditation for 10 minutes every single day now the main benefit here is that meditation is a great way to balance out all the Time: 04:10 - 04:20 distracting dopamine you might be getting throughout the day it's also a great way to lower cortisol which is your stress hormone as well as increase focus and here's a very simple five-step Time: 04:20 - 04:30 meditation routine first find a quiet place where you won't be disturbed for 10 minutes second sit in a comfortable position either in a chair or on the floor make sure your back is straight Time: 04:30 - 04:40 but not tense third start a timer for 10 minutes fourth close your eyes and focus on your breath try to notice the sensation of air flowing in and out fifth be present don't try to judge or Time: 04:40 - 04:50 fight any random thoughts simply acknowledge them and return your focus to your breath after implementing these habits hopefully you can lower your Baseline dopamine level but it still Time: 04:50 - 05:00 might be far away from studying on the pleasure scale so now the goal isn't to move your Baseline level even lower instead it's to move studying up the pleasure scale so we can make learning Time: 05:00 - 05:10 fun and you know what else makes learning fun the sponsor of this video skillshare skillshare is the ultimate online destination to pick up almost any skill that you can imagine from web Time: 05:10 - 05:20 development and video editing to productivity and mindfulness the platform has thousands of classes spanning all skill levels so no matter what you want to learn you're bound to Time: 05:20 - 05:30 find something that's the right fit for you personally I think it's super important for all students in today's world to have digital skills like programming and graphic design luckily Time: 05:30 - 05:40 skillshare not only offers classes for these skills but they also offer something called learning pths which are curated collections of classes designed to help you master specific skills for Time: 05:40 - 05:50 example I'm interested in taking the creative productivity learning path which will help me with everything from being more creative to optimizing my workflow what I love about skillshare is Time: 05:50 - 06:00 that you are learning from experts who are passionate about what they're teaching the lessons are energetic bite-sized and very easy to digest and as you take these classes you'll both learn the relevant knowledge and also Time: 06:00 - 06:10 get the chance to apply that knowledge through projects best of all you can access the classes from whenever wherever so they're easy to fit into your schedule as a busy student if Time: 06:10 - 06:20 you're ready to pick up some new skills this school year head to my description the first 500 people to use the link in my description will get a free 1-month trial of skillshare get started today Time: 06:20 - 06:30 and now back to the video okay so for this next part of the video we're going to talk about how to make studying more enjoyable in other words move it up the pleasure scale to do this you have to Time: 06:30 - 06:40 consider five different factors where what how when who and why first we have to consider where if you're always studying in a dark dingy environment Time: 06:40 - 06:50 something as simple as studying in a different room can make studying more pleasurable back in college I would love studying in different campus libraries particularly Barker Library which was located right underneath the MIT Dome Time: 06:50 - 07:00 here take a look at a few pictures and tell me this doesn't look mesmerizing but if you're not in college yet you could study at your local library instead or maybe a cafe or even outside Time: 07:00 - 07:10 choose a place that's novel but not distracting for example you don't want to study in a place with too many people or too much noise even if it feels like a fun place to be now if you don't feel Time: 07:10 - 07:20 like walking or driving somewhere to study don't worry because you can still make it feel like you're studying somewhere new just head to YouTube and search up Ambiance and instantly you Time: 07:20 - 07:30 will find videos each between 2 and 10 hours long that will transport you into different worlds for example do you want to study in a bookstore Cafe while listening to Jazz no well what about a Time: 07:30 - 07:40 cozy wooden house in the forest while listening to some rainfall or what about a cabin or what about a spaceship or what about Hogwarts not going to lie I Time: 07:40 - 07:50 sometimes throw that one on while working I would definitely recommend next you have to consider what you study with I mean doesn't it always feel exciting to study with a new notebook or a new in of pens or pencils no am I the Time: 07:50 - 08:00 only one I remember back when I was taking AP Cal I got the ti84 plus C which is that fancy graphing calculator with a colored screen I kid you not just Time: 08:00 - 08:10 because I had that calculator I actually enjoyed doing my Cal homework for the first few weeks of that class now the point here isn't to go out and buy a bunch of expensive things to make studying more fun if you have the budget Time: 08:10 - 08:20 to buy a few new things great but the main point here is to introduce just a pinch of novelty and that could be as small as using a pen instead of a pencil Time: 08:20 - 08:30 or Cornell notes instead of the outline method actually I'm not the biggest fan of Cornell notes so maybe not that okay so we just talked about where and what now I want you to think about how you Time: 08:30 - 08:40 study now the problem with how we study is that the payoff is all the way at the end only after studying for 2 3 or 4 hours when we can finally check studying off our to-do list do we feel that sense Time: 08:40 - 08:50 of gratification but while we study we usually feel pretty miserable so we have to figure out a way to feel that sense of gratification not just just after Time: 08:50 - 09:00 studying but while studying and this requires us to hack our brains reward system so I have a question for you what is the most satisfying feeling as a student besides doing well on an exam Time: 09:00 - 09:10 it's checking things off your to-do list so the trick here is to create a super granular to-do list on a sticky note and place it next to you while you're studying this way you can feel the Time: 09:10 - 09:20 satisfaction of checking things off while you're working and not just after for example you can write things down like read five pages read 10 pages read 15 Pages or write one paragraph two Time: 09:20 - 09:30 paragraphs three paragraphs by having this granular to-do list studying will start to feel like a game and obviously games are pretty fun now if you want to take this even one step further you can Time: 09:30 - 09:40 associate each thing on your checklist with a different reward for example next to read 10 pages you could put down take a 5-minute break or grab a snack so now Time: 09:40 - 09:50 you're going to feel the pleasure both of checking things off and getting rewarded for making progress this is literally a way to turn studying into a fun video game and if this doesn't move Time: 09:50 - 10:00 it up the pleasure scale then I don't know what will next I want you to focus on when you study now this is totally up to personal preference but I feel much better when I tackle hard homework assignments earlier in the day so for Time: 10:00 - 10:10 example back in high school I would do homework right after school or better yet even during school I can't even begin to explain how great it felt to finish homework during study hall and Time: 10:10 - 10:20 this was especially the case during my senior year when I was taking 5 AP classes and also applying to colleges I would also try to squeeze and work in between classes for example if I got to Time: 10:20 - 10:30 class A few minutes early or if I had a few free minutes at the end of a class I would just pull out a homework assignment and answer the first question right then and there this way once I got Time: 10:30 - 10:40 home I no longer felt that burden of starting an assignment from scratch instead I just had to keep the momentum going now I will add one caveat to this however numerous studies show that Time: 10:40 - 10:50 studying right before bed can help with memory consolidation however I'm still going to stick to my original point I still think it's beneficial to study as early as possible in the day however Time: 10:50 - 11:00 right before bed maybe you can throw in a Light review session all right next I want you to consider who you study with now I'll be honest finding a friend to work with is one of the easiest ways to make studying more fun yes you have Time: 11:00 - 11:10 someone who can quiz you or explain Concepts but you also have someone who can help reduce the stress some of my best memories from college come from when I was studying with my friends at 1 Time: 11:10 - 11:20 or 2: a.m. and it was during these late night study sessions when we had some of our funniest moments which does lead me to one caveat you should only study with your friends for certain kinds of assignments studying with them the night Time: 11:20 - 11:30 before a big exam might be a recipe for disaster if yall don't know how to stay disciplined and focused now unfortunately my friends and I did not have that discipline all the time which Time: 11:30 - 11:40 is why we wouldn't really study together before huge midterms or finals but during the week we would always get together for pets or anything else that wasn't as important and then finally I Time: 11:40 - 11:50 want you to consider why you study many students study just for the grade not for the sake of actually learning the content and look I don't blame you I I'm not jumping for joy at the thought of Time: 11:50 - 12:00 learning about Hamlet or the KB cycle but education is a privilege and to be well read in this era where the world is more distracting and distracted than ever is a gift so I want you to switch Time: 12:00 - 12:10 your perspective instead of thinking I have to study this think I get to study this this one subtle shift can make studying feel so much more enjoyable and Time: 12:10 - 12:20 meaningful and yes while I understand that the individual topics might feel a bit irrelevant school isn't just about learning a bunch of random facts and formulas though it might feel like that Time: 12:20 - 12:30 at times school is instead about who you become in the process regardless of whether you want to be a doctor a lawyer an engineer or even if you don't want to Time: 12:30 - 12:40 go to college you will have to learn to synthesize information think critically and approach complex problems all of which are skills you learn as a student Time: 12:40 - 12:50 so even if School feels irrelevant or pointless owledge the benefits and how that develops you as a person to survive in the real world so hopefully with the these six key aspects in mind you can Time: 12:50 - 13:00 make studying feel not only bearable but also enjoyable and if you want to make studying feel even more enjoyable feel free to join my Discord which has over 180,000 students from all around the Time: 13:00 - 13:10 world you can join my newsletter the studio student for weekly study tips and you can always subscribe for more tips thanks for watching and I'll see you again next week Time: 13:10 - 13:201. 10~15 min walk each day (likely morning); no phone usage at all, sit with thoughts, feelings, sights, senses 2. No phone for first 30 minutes and last 30 minutes of the day 3. Practice mindfulness/meditation 10 minutes each day (balance out dopamine, increase focus) 4. Where (you study): study in a different, more comfortable space 5. What (you study with): new supplies/material, introduce a pinch of novelty 6. How (you study): what is the most satisfying feeling as a student 7. When (you study): earlier in the day (right after school or even during school) 8. Who (you study with): friend/study buddy makes studying much more fun 9. Why (you study): study with purpose, a goal",

00:20 is so cold that icicles start to form on the shower head only once I've lost all motor function in my fingers I'll decide to jump out and start my next habit of the day meditation now this one's Time: 00:20 - 00:30 special I'll sit still for hours as I contemplate the meaning of the universe I'll dwell on string theory and the Big Bang as I listen to Mozart's entire discography and after that well it's Time: 00:30 - 00:40 time for breakfast nothing like some straight vegetables and a cup of water to start the day usually by now it's around 3:30 a.m. so I'll spend the next 4 hours before school reading up on next Time: 00:40 - 00:50 week's lectures and of course this is all a lie I never have and never will ever in my life wake up at 3:00 in the morning and cold hours I don't really Time: 00:50 - 01:00 like them let's break down The Five Habits that actually helped me succeed as a student all right let's break down habit number one back in high school I would follow an after school routine and I Time: 01:00 - 01:10 genuinely believe this is one of the best habits that you can form as a student now here's the reality for most students that you might even be familiar Time: 01:10 - 01:20 with they'll come home from school they'll sit on the couch they'll bring out their phone and they'll end up scrolling for hours on end the whole point of having an after school routine and more importantly actually following Time: 01:20 - 01:30 it is to make sure you don't get lost in this Rabbit Hole essentially you want to make it as easy as possible to jump into work as soon as you come home but goar Time: 01:30 - 01:40 what if I'm exhausted and don't want to do any work you know what you can take a break but here's the thing you have to use a timer don't just sit on the couch and tell yourself oh I'm just taking a Time: 01:40 - 01:50 little break if you want to take an actual Break by all means do so but make sure that in 15 minutes or in 30 minutes your alarm goes off and you get to to Time: 01:50 - 02:00 work otherwise you'll just find yourself scrolling Tik Tok endlessly now here's what my routine roughly looked like in high school I would come home from school and I would relax for 10 to 15 minutes then I'd spend the next 10 to 15 Time: 02:00 - 02:10 minutes getting ready to work both physically and mentally I'd clean up my work space I'd bring out my supplies I'd update my to-do list I'd make sure that everything that I needed to work was Time: 02:10 - 02:20 primed and ready to go and then I just jump right into work I would grind for anywhere between 30 minutes to an hour or just when it was time to eat dinner Time: 02:20 - 02:30 after dinner i' come back to my desk and I'd start my first real grind session of the day I would sometimes work for 2 3 or even 4 hours straight but now here's Time: 02:30 - 02:40 the thing every student grinds differently some students prefer to focus on one different subject every single day for example they might do math on Monday science on Tuesday Time: 02:40 - 02:50 English on Wednesday and so on other students myself included prefer to do a little bit of each subject every single day and that leads me into my next habit for pretty much all of high school and Time: 02:50 - 03:00 college I would evenly distribute everything for example if I had 2 weeks to do a 70-page AP psych reading I would read five pages every day if I had 3 Time: 03:00 - 03:10 Days To Do 24 AP Cal problems I would answer eight problems every day honestly this habit gave me so much comfort because it prevented me from cramming there were so many points during Time: 03:10 - 03:20 freshman year of high school when I had 1 two or even 3 weeks to do an assignment but I would find myself doing it within the final few days and I'm going to be hon Hest with you I still Time: 03:20 - 03:30 follow this Habit to this day for example when it came to this video I had around seven scenes and 7even days to shoot it so I've been shooting one scene every day yes I find this habit pretty Time: 03:30 - 03:40 helpful but I think the next one is what actually allowed me to get straight A all right before we jump into the next habit I want to talk a little bit about Time: 03:40 - 03:50 how school can be pretty stressful at times not only do you have to balance academics with extracurriculars but you also have to think about friends family Hobbies and so much more look all of Time: 03:50 - 04:00 this is a natural part of being a student and if you find yourself feeling pretty stressed know that you're not alone but I get it sometimes it might just feel like too much and you really Time: 04:00 - 04:10 want to talk to someone and that's where the sponsor of this video comes in better help look if you've ever thought about therapy you've probably realized that starting is pretty hard sometimes Time: 04:10 - 04:20 you might not be able to find a therapist around you and at other times the idea of doing a face-to-face therapy session sounds kind of intimidating well better help is a platform form that Time: 04:20 - 04:30 makes starting therapy super easy all you have to do is fill out a short questionnaire and within 48 hours they'll match you to one of the 30,000 licensed therapists that are in their Time: 04:30 - 04:40 Network and the best part is you can do your sessions in almost any format you can do it as a phone call a video chat or even over text you can book these sessions whenever you have time Time: 04:40 - 04:50 throughout the week and make it a habit to check in on yourself and take care of your mental health if you think you might benefit from therapy and want to check out better help then head to this link clicking it will not only support Time: 04:50 - 05:00 this channel but it'll also get you 10% off your first month all right now on to the next habit all right I have some good news and I have some bad news so Time: 05:00 - 05:10 I'm guessing you want to hear the bad news first out of all the habits that I'm going through in this video this is probably the one that's the hardest to implement but the good news is that out of all the habits this is probably the Time: 05:10 - 05:20 one that will have the biggest impact on your grades all right you need to get into the habit of confronting your knowledge gaps and now you might be sitting there saying well gohar I Time: 05:20 - 05:30 already do that I study every single day I go through my flashcards and so on and yes this is a way of confronting your knowledge gaps but I genuinely believe the students who do well in school go Time: 05:30 - 05:40 one step further so let's walk through a little scenario let's say you're sitting in a push and your teacher's handing back the last exam you get yours back and you see you got five out of 30 Time: 05:40 - 05:50 questions wrong you start flipping through your exam packet you look at each error but you just tell yourself oh these were dumb mistakes and then let's say a few hours later you're sitting at home studying for the next aush exam and Time: 05:50 - 06:00 you come across the terms horizontal integration and vertical integration now deep down you know you don't fully understand these terms but what do you Time: 06:00 - 06:10 do because you've heard of them before and because they sound Vaguely Familiar you just say oh yeah I know what these mean and you move on look if you have had this experience you are not alone Time: 06:10 - 06:20 and I have had it myself plenty of times but the reality is in these situations you have to accept what it is you don't know and do whatever you can to fill in that knowledge gap for example if you Time: 06:20 - 06:30 get an exam question wrong instead of just dismissing it I want you to imagine yourself taking that exam again and answering that exact same question go through your train of logic rewrite Time: 06:30 - 06:40 these steps if necessary and figure out exactly where things went wrong similarly if you come across a term or a concept you're not too familiar with in Time: 06:40 - 06:50 that moment you should pull up Quizlet your flashcards your textbook whatever resource you need to fully understand that term yes this habit will make your study sessions longer and more Time: 06:50 - 07:00 uncomfortable but as you've probably heard many times over the internet if you're uncomfortable it means you're learning in my opinion it's very easy to just dismiss or put off the things you Time: 07:00 - 07:10 don't fully understand and you need to do everything you can to prevent that from happening now there's another habit I want you to follow as well let's talk about it all right so this next habit is less Time: 07:10 - 07:20 of a habit and more of a life philosophy and here it is get comfortable asking for things so I'm going to go ahead and put this in the context of college Time: 07:20 - 07:30 admissions if you're a high school student there's a good chance you've seen those College acceptance videos all over YouTube you see these students screaming jumping up and down getting into a bunch of Ivy League schools so Time: 07:30 - 07:40 like any normal high school student what do you do well you try to figure out what the heck they did in high school slowly but surely you find out about the activities they did the awards they won Time: 07:40 - 07:50 and you slowly tell yourself there is no way I could ever do this myself and look part of me accepted the fact that I probably couldn't do most of that stuff stuff for example some of the students Time: 07:50 - 08:00 that are winning these International math competitions literally start training while they're in elementary school but at the same time I was looking at some of these activities and Time: 08:00 - 08:10 accomplishments and telling myself there might be a way that I could do that for example a lot of these Superstar students were doing scientific research in high school and I slowly realized Time: 08:10 - 08:20 wait if I just email professors at colleges around me I could probably get a research position myself and that's what I did I sent off a bunch of emails Not Afraid asking for a potential Time: 08:20 - 08:30 research assistant position or an internship position and before you knew it one of those professors got back to me and offered me a position and I actually did a similar thing to become editor and chief of my school's Time: 08:30 - 08:40 newspaper so I joined newspaper Club my freshman year and by the time I was a junior I had written a bunch of Articles and I even helped to digitize the entire School paper now there really wasn't a Time: 08:40 - 08:50 formal way of choosing editor and chief so when the old one was graduating I went up to the adviser and asked hey could I just be the next editor and chief and given my track record it Time: 08:50 - 09:00 wasn't too hard for her to say yes look the big takeaway here is that if you really want to bolster your high school resume lots of things won't just be handed to you in fact some of these Time: 09:00 - 09:10 things don't even have applications you kind of just need to understand what you want who you'll potentially have to ask and then have the guts to go and ask them this could be for research getting a leadership role job shadowing starting Time: 09:10 - 09:20 a club getting funding for a business and so on trust me learning how to send the right cold message to the right person can drastically change your high school trajectory maybe I'll make a Time: 09:20 - 09:30 video just about this let me know oh okay so uh next habit I want you to do something that you enjoy every Time: 09:30 - 09:40 single day it could be listening to music it could be watching your favorite TV show honestly if all you're doing is working day in and day out you're eventually going to burn out as a student and look I'm not asking you to Time: 09:40 - 09:50 indulge yourself for like several hours every day I'm just saying that you should find something small that makes your day a little bit better maybe it's going for a walk maybe it's reading a little bit maybe just trying out a new Time: 09:50 - 10:00 hobby a little bit of variety that comes in the form of doing these small things that make your day a bit better can make it so much easier to be a student now look you might be sitting there saying gohar I'm taking like four or five AP Time: 10:00 - 10:10 classes I do not have time to read or watch TV shows and yeah I totally get that so I have two other Solutions one just do something you enjoy each day even if it's just for 10 or 15 minutes Time: 10:10 - 10:20 if you're short on time that's totally fine just do something small to make the day a bit better or at the very least if you can't find time during the weekdays make sure that you decompress or do Time: 10:20 - 10:30 something special on the weekends look I hope the take away from this video wasn't that you have to just keep grinding and keep working hard 24/7 it's super important to balance academics with all the other parts of your life Time: 10:30 - 10:40 like friends family hobbies and so on and speaking of doing things for fun I actually got to go to the gym right now so like And subscribe for more Time: 10:40 - 10:50For every like I will study 10 mins 😂😂",

00:30 video if you or a loved one has been diagnosed with brain rot this video is for you brain rot is a chronic condition that affects millions of students worldwide symptoms include having the Time: 00:30 - 00:40 attention span of a goldfish constantly checking your phone for new notifications filling Every Idle moment in your life with short form content and the worst symptom of them all not being able to focus without Subway Surfers Time: 00:40 - 00:50 playing on the side can I please have my phone back no keep listening fortunately I've helped thousands of students overcome this condition but I need you to follow my advice care carefully and Time: 00:50 - 01:00 watch this video Until the End here's the harsh truth about brain Rob once you start it's very hard to stop social media isn't designed to give you content that's good for you it's designed to Time: 01:00 - 01:10 give you content it knows you're going to watch whether it's going to enhance your life in some way or detract from it most students trap themselves in what I call a brain rot cycle they'll engage with a few brain rot videos on the Time: 01:10 - 01:20 timeline triggering the algorithm to believe hey this student likes brain rot so what does the algorithm do it serves the student even more brain rot and it becomes Comes This NeverEnding cycle Time: 01:20 - 01:30 that's why the first thing you need to do to treat your brain rot is something called an algorithm detox you need to train the algorithm to give you rich and fulfilling content what I like to call Time: 01:30 - 01:40 Brain nourishment the next time you see a cheap piece of content on the timeline I need you to hold down and press not interested you can also try to scroll by as fast as possible just so the Time: 01:40 - 01:50 algorithm doesn't get the wrong idea but an algorithm detox isn't just about getting the algorithm to show you less bad content it's also about getting the algorithm to show you more good content Time: 01:50 - 02:00 so for example if you see an educational video feel free to like comment and even subscribe to the Creator I hope you're getting the hint but in all seriousness try to consume longer and richer media Time: 02:00 - 02:10 to not only fix your attention span but to signal to the algorithm that that's the kind of content that you like seek out documentaries seek out podcasts be Time: 02:10 - 02:20 intentional about your media consumption the people who beat brain rot are intentional consumers and the people who brain rot beats are passive consumers they just go wherever the algorithm Time: 02:20 - 02:30 takes them if you don't know where to find richer content here are some of my favorite channels Vsauce veritasium Wendover Productions and Mark Rober my favorite podcast include Founders which is mostly for entrepreneurial people as Time: 02:30 - 02:40 well as how I built this which is also for entrepreneurial people if any of you have any science or History Podcast recommendations just drop them in the comments so doing an algorithm detox is Time: 02:40 - 02:50 a great first step in treating your brain rot but it alone is not sufficient you can very much have a detoxified algorithm and still be glued to your phone that's why the second step in Time: 02:50 - 03:00 treating brain rot is setting boundaries technology has crept its way into every single corner of our Lives some Corners that it shouldn't even be exploring for example I have some friends who cannot Time: 03:00 - 03:10 take a shower without their phones oh yeah I do that all the time what I'm going to let that soak in for a second no punen intended see now I understand bringing your phone to the bathroom Time: 03:10 - 03:20 actually even that is kind of weird in my opinion but taking it into the shower just signals a whole another level of dependence part of overcoming R rot is Time: 03:20 - 03:30 being able to easily transition between the digital world and the real world and loosening this crippling dependence on technology if you do not draw a clear line indicating where technology should Time: 03:30 - 03:40 and shouldn't be in your life it will constantly beg for your attention and pull you out of the present moment thankfully I'm pretty sure that none of you are using your phones in the shower but I am sure you're using your phone in Time: 03:40 - 03:50 situations you shouldn't be whether that's dinner with family while doing homework or even in class setting boundaries is as simple as creating physical distance between you and technology and important situations for Time: 03:50 - 04:00 example unless you're using your phone as a calculator or as a timer keep it away from you while you're doing homework if you're in school maybe just keep your phone in your backpack that's actually one weird thing I did in high Time: 04:00 - 04:10 school I kept my phone in my backpack instead of my pocket but it was great because I never felt tempted to use it during class now the harsh reality is nobody is going to enforce these boundaries for you you need not only the Time: 04:10 - 04:20 discipline but the self-respect to follow these rules that you set for yourself I have a question for you if your teacher tells you to do a homework assignment even if you really don't want Time: 04:20 - 04:30 to you're still going to do it right if your coach tells you to run a mile in the blistering heat even if you're exhausted you're still going to do it right and if your parents tell you to throw out the garbage even if it's Time: 04:30 - 04:40 pouring outside you're still going to gladly do it right well maybe not gladly but you're still going to do it so when you tell yourself that you're going to put your phone away in Focus why don't you listen to yourself you need to hold Time: 04:40 - 04:50 yourself in as high regard as you do these other people in your life your ability to make a promise to yourself and keep that promise will not only help you overcome brain rot but also succeed Time: 04:50 - 05:00 in every single area of your life dude it's not over yet let's face it we turn to brain rot whenever we're bored but if we're not bored then we Time: 05:00 - 05:10 won't turn to brain rot you need to find meaningful ways to fill the time whenever you're bored and one way to do so is by learning a new skill for example you can learn to program you can Time: 05:10 - 05:20 learn to play an instrument you can learn to Garden or you can even learn a new language which is where the sponsor of this video comes in mangoda I have always wanted to learn Spanish in fact I Time: 05:20 - 05:30 took four years of Spanish in high school but when I visited Spain 2 years ago and got trapped in an elevator the only word that I knew how to say was a udam man I would love to travel to Spain Time: 05:30 - 05:40 again and I would even love to make videos in Spanish so that's why I recently signed up for one of lingoda language learning courses these courses offer a rich and immersive learning experience with certified native level Time: 05:40 - 05:50 speakers they go over real world language for everyday situations including humor accents and expressions I visited Ling's website SEL ected Spanish and got started with lingot flex Time: 05:50 - 06:00 which is one of their three different options lingoda Flex is for those who want to take classes on their own time either one-on-one or in small groups lingoda teams is for those who want to Time: 06:00 - 06:10 stick with the same teachers and classmates and lingoda Sprint is a two-month challenge for those who want to accelerate their language learning journey I was really pleased with how easy it was to sign up it only took Time: 06:10 - 06:20 three steps the first was to choose my level of difficulty the second was to book my first class and the third was to download the lesson materials although the material was easy to understand I Time: 06:20 - 06:30 was a bit nervous I mean what if I forgot a word or mispronounced something luckily my first class was way better than I could have imagined I was in a class with four other students and the professor was super kind and sweet Time: 06:30 - 06:40 during class we went over vocab we went over dialogue and then after class the instructor sent us personalized feedback so we could pinpoint our weaknesses Time: 06:40 - 06:50 after having taken several classes I can genuinely say I feel an improvement in my Spanish and can say more than just a UDA man learn with lingoda and tailor your learning path to your goals click the link in my description or use the Time: 06:50 - 07:00 discount code go hard for $25 off when signing up that's such a good deal it is and now back to the video so I have a question do you remember the first day Time: 07:00 - 07:10 you used Chad GPT gemini or Claude do you remember how Blown Away you felt AI is only going to continue to get more powerful over the coming years in ways Time: 07:10 - 07:20 that we can't even imagine and as this happens I imagine people will split into one of two groups those who use AI to supplement their mental Capac capacities Time: 07:20 - 07:30 and those who use AI as a mental crutch that's why before this technology gets any stronger I need you to lose the crutches well what does that mean I need you to stop over relying on technology Time: 07:30 - 07:40 at the expense of your own mental fortitude for example we'll lunge for our phones even to do the simplest calculations quick what's 30% of 20 Time: 07:40 - 07:50 shoot um um um five did you really just say five other times we'll use AI to write these Sim list messages for example an email to a Time: 07:50 - 08:00 teacher quick can you tell me which sentence is grammatically correct and why the list of assignments are due next week or the list of assignments is due next week although using AI to write Time: 08:00 - 08:10 emails or to do mental math is not the end of the world we cannot become over Reliant otherwise we will just gradually weaken our abilities to do mental math Time: 08:10 - 08:20 to write grammatically correct sentences and to articulate our thoughts a simple way to see this is to think of your brain as a muscle those moments when you're using your brain power to calculate something or stiff through Time: 08:20 - 08:30 your thoughts are the moments when you're strengthening your neural Pathways and embracing these mental challenges literally Alters the structure of your brain for example a 2004 study by Bogan deky found that Time: 08:30 - 08:40 learning to juggle increased gray matter in brain areas involved with visual motion processing another study in Frontiers in human Neuroscience found that older adults who underwent memory Time: 08:40 - 08:50 training experienced increased cortical thickness in several brain areas parts of their brain literally got thicker now I'm not sitting here saying that you Time: 08:50 - 09:00 should renounce all technology and only rely on your mind for example I use AI all the time often to help with coding tasks and even writing tasks just make sure you're relying more on your actual Time: 09:00 - 09:10 intelligence instead of an artificial one he's low-key cooking yeah first off if you have made it to this point of the video congratulations it seems like you are already following the first tip now Time: 09:10 - 09:20 I have an observation and you can tell me if you think I'm right or wrong but I believe that today's younger generation sucks at dealing with items this and Time: 09:20 - 09:30 look I've been guilty of this myself but hear me out if we have two free minutes in between classes we'll go on our phones if we have two free minutes before meeting we'll go on our phones and if we have a minute in between sets Time: 09:30 - 09:40 at the gym We'll go on our phones we have become hardwired to pull out our phones to fill up Every Idle moment of our existence and often we're pulling our phone out for no other reason than Time: 09:40 - 09:50 to fill that moment it's not like we're pulling it out to respond to important texts or emails it's usually just to scroll through social media and get that instant dopamine hit if you are serious Time: 09:50 - 10:00 about curing your brain rot I need you to embrace idleness whenever you have a free moment take a deep breath stretch drink some water observe the environment around you try to be present in the Time: 10:00 - 10:10 moment I'm sure we're all extremely busy people running from one class to another from one meeting to another these idle moments are a gift and they're few and Time: 10:10 - 10:20 far between instead of filling them with meaningless stimulation just try to cherish the moment if you don't take time to embrace the idol moments to just sit back and be present in the world Time: 10:20 - 10:30 around you life is going to go by like this and I'm not saying this to scare you you're young and have so much more life to live I just want to tell you now while you're still young so you can Time: 10:30 - 10:40 fully experience and feel where life takes you over the coming years and decades dang wow Bros got me thinking too now so throughout this video I've been repeating one idea over and over Time: 10:40 - 10:50 use your phone less use your phone less use your phone less and at this point you might believe that brain rot is the result of using your phone to much now Time: 10:50 - 11:00 yes while that is a cause it's not the only cause brain rot is also the result of how you treat your body as a whole that's why in order to cure it you need to monitor the system let's start off Time: 11:00 - 11:10 with the most important part of that system your diet you know how sugar makes your teeth rot well it also makes your brain rot in a way a 2022 study in neurology found that those who ate the Time: 11:10 - 11:20 most junk food had a 28% faster rate of global cognitive decline and a 25% faster rate of executive function decline compared to those who ate the Time: 11:20 - 11:30 least amount of junk food to improve your brain health consume food that's rich in omega- 3 fatty acids antioxidants and vitamins particularly B vitamins now this doesn't mean that eating fish and Time: 11:30 - 11:40 blueberries is going to turn you into Einstein but numerous studies show that antioxidants and omega-3 fatty acids can help slow the rate of cognitive decline in older adults now another important Time: 11:40 - 11:50 part of the system is physical exercise regular physical exercise has been shown to increase the size of the hippocampus the part of the brain brain involved in Time: 11:50 - 12:00 verbal memory and learning a study published in the Journal of Alzheimer's disease found that older adults who engage in regular aerobic exercise had not only larger brain volumes but better cognitive function compared to their Time: 12:00 -

      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:10 want them to be but you know you have it in you you know you could do better you know you could get straight A if you just lock in for the rest of the semester look if you're trying to go from an F to an A in one week or even Time: 00:10 - 00:20 one semester this video is not going to help you but if you're trying to go from a b to an A or from a c to a b and you genuinely commit to the advice in this Time: 00:20 - 00:30 video you will succeed but before I dive into all my different techniques and ways that you can improve your grade you have to ask yourself one important question why are your grades not where Time: 00:30 - 00:40 you want them to be and I want you to answer this honestly I think most students have one of these four answers you're overwhelmed you're struggling Time: 00:40 - 00:50 you're distracted or you're lazy and look I don't mean that in a rude way I have been all four of these things at one point or another but if you genuinely want to improve your grades as Time: 00:50 - 01:00 quickly as possible you need to evaluate your situation honestly if you're overwhelmed it means your grades aren't where you want them to be because you have way too much on your plate maybe you're taking a bunch of AP classes Time: 01:00 - 01:10 maybe you're in a bunch of extracurriculars and because of these commitments you can't fully devote yourself to your academics if you're struggling it means you might have the Time: 01:10 - 01:20 time and you're actually putting in the work but you simply can't grasp the content in other words it's hard to get that information to stick inside your brain if you're distracted it means you're struggling to focus and complete Time: 01:20 - 01:30 your work maybe because you're going on your phone you're playing video games you're watching Netflix or something else and if you're lazy well it just means you're lazy that doesn't mean you Time: 01:30 - 01:40 don't do the work it simply means you don't give it your all for example maybe you finish 80% of your homework and call it a day or maybe you spend 30 minutes studying for an exam and think that's Time: 01:40 - 01:50 enough you might just be one of these things or you might be all four so let's dive into Concrete Solutions for each scenario so you can turn your grades around as quickly as possible scenario Time: 01:50 - 02:00 number one you're overwhelmed my junior year of high school I made a huge mistake I enrolled into five AP classes now mind you junior year is one of the Time: 02:00 - 02:10 hardest years of high school it's the year you have to start thinking about college apps prepping for standardized tests it's the year some of your extracurriculars might get really serious but for some reason I wanted to Time: 02:10 - 02:20 push myself to the absolute Max so I went up to my guidance counselor and asked her to put me into AP chem AP Cal AP Lang APUSH and AP Euro now you might Time: 02:20 - 02:30 be saying goart two history APS well not for long a week into the school year I realized there was no way I was going to be able to handle all those courses so I Time: 02:30 - 02:40 ended up dropping AP Euro I swapped it out for a study hall and I don't regret that decision at all doing so gave me more time to study for the ACT to devote to newspaper Club to have a life outside Time: 02:40 - 02:50 of school so if you're in a similar situation if you're overwhelmed I want you to step back and seriously consider which commitments you can drop whether it's an elective you don't need or a Time: 02:50 - 03:00 club you're not excited about cut down to make time for the stuff that matters but let's say you watch this video towards the end of the school year obviously you can't just drop your Time: 03:00 - 03:10 commitments in that case I have another tip make special requests if you have too much on your plate and can't complete an assignment on time email your teacher not a day before but Time: 03:10 - 03:20 several days before and I promise you they'll be willing to accommodate if you're part of a club and can't make it to a weekly meeting because you have to study for the SAT tell tell them in Time: 03:20 - 03:30 advance and I promise you they'll find a way to keep you involved I think the mistake most students make is that they'll either never ask for these accommodations or they'll ask for them way too late I promise if you plan ahead Time: 03:30 - 03:40 and ask the right people weeks or even days in advance you'll find a way to balance everything all right scenario number two you're struggling and before Time: 03:40 - 03:50 I continue yes I know that you're struggling could technically also mean you're overwhelmed but in the context of this video it means you're putting in the work but struggling to grasp the Time: 03:50 - 04:00 information the first step here and this might hit hard for the overachievers watching this is to let go of your ego if you've always been the smart kid or if things have always come easy to you Time: 04:00 - 04:10 you have to realize that struggle is okay and that it's an inevitable part of the learning process this is a lesson that hit so hard for me my freshman year Time: 04:10 - 04:20 of college so the highest level of physics I had taken before entering MIT was honors physics because my school didn't offer AP Physics and let me tell you the the jump from honors physics at Time: 04:20 - 04:30 my small public high school to introductory physics at MIT was astounding it felt like going from a light jog to a fullon Sprint but what I Time: 04:30 - 04:40 did and what I recommend you do is leverage every resource at your disposal this might not be super relevant if you're in high school but if you're in college you probably have office hours Time: 04:40 - 04:50 your school might have a tutoring center I want you to make the most of these resources I loved office hours because sometimes they would just give you the answers to really different ult homework Time: 04:50 - 05:00 problems but more importantly they give you a step-by-step explanation and really help you understand the fundamentals now if you're in high school and don't have access to office hours or a tutoring center I want you to Time: 05:00 - 05:10 leverage study partners and even ai ai is changing the studying game and I'm sorry I've been meaning to make a video about Ai and studying for a while now Time: 05:10 - 05:20 but very quickly let me tell you a couple ways that you can use it you can have it explain Concepts to you like you're 5 years old you can have it generate practice questions and you can even have it gener at study schedules Time: 05:20 - 05:30 like the possibilities are wild okay and I also recommend that you find a study partner but I don't recommend that you work with them always but if there's a concept or unit you don't understand and Time: 05:30 - 05:40 you have a huge exam coming up meet up with them try to tackle it together and explain the concept to one another if you've been following the channel for a while now you know we love the strategy Time: 05:40 - 05:50 which is also known as definement technique and you know what else we love browsing the internet safely which is where the sponsor of this video comes in Surf shark surf surf shark is a VPN a Time: 05:50 -

06:50 surf shark all right and moving on to scenario number three you're distracted all right this is a big one that I'm sure affects us all especially in this Time: 06:50 - 07:00 era when we're all just glued to our phones it feels like it's just getting harder and harder to sit down and do work so look I could easily just sit here and tell you to put your phone away while working and go about my day but Time: 07:00 - 07:10 you know that's easier said than done I know that's easier said than done so let me give you a couple practical Solutions if you're decent at staying focused and Time: 07:10 - 07:20 only sometimes get distracted by your phone I recommend silencing notifications placing your phone face down and simply doing your work if it's a bit hard harder for you to stay off Time: 07:20 - 07:30 your phone I recommend setting time limits and placing your phone in a different room while working but if you really struggle you'll need an external Force to hold you accountable so in that Time: 07:30 - 07:40 case I recommend having a family member or a roommate keep your phone away from you while you're working oh and here's a bonus tip use grayscale mode it'll make your phone less fun to use and help you Time: 07:40 - 07:50 stay off of it I'll be honest I tried doing this a while ago and although it worked it was really hard but I've heard of people having pretty decent success with this strategy okay so you've taken Time: 07:50 - 08:00 care of your phone but maybe you're still struggling to focus the next step is to declutter your mind and your space when it comes to decluttering your space just get rid of any objects or garbage Time: 08:00 - 08:10 that might distract you I'm a fan of keeping your study space relatively minimal and when it comes to decluttering your mind try using ambient sounds like white pink or even Brown noise some people use these sounds to Time: 08:10 - 08:20 help them with sleep some people use them to help them with stress but a lot of students use them to help with Focus personally I like brown noise the most pink and white seem just a bit too harsh Time: 08:20 - 08:30 all right and scenario number four you're lazy okay so in this situation the issue might not be that you're overwhelmed or that you're struggling is that you're simply not motivated to do Time: 08:30 - 08:40 the work for example maybe you start your assignments late and only do 50% of them maybe you start studying for an exam at the very last minute or maybe you are finishing your assignment and Time: 08:40 - 08:50 you are putting in the time but maybe you're just studying in a lazy way let me explain you have two kinds of studying you have passive studying and you have active active studying passive Time: 08:50 - 09:00 studying includes rereading the textbook re-watching lectures highlighting your notes active studying on the other hand is when you're engaging with the content and assessing your knowledge for example Time: 09:00 - 09:10 doing practice questions pretending to teach others not just rereading your notes but rewriting key Concepts and diagrams in your own words now here's the dangerous part passive studying Time: 09:10 - 09:20 feels just as effective as active studying it feels like you're putting in the work but it's nowhere near as effective as active studying it's like eating a bunch of junk food versus a Time: 09:20 - 09:30 nutritious meal in the moment you're going to feel full after both but in the long run that garbage meal is not going to give you the nutrients that you need so if you've been passively studying for Time: 09:30 - 09:40 most of your exams and want to actually make a quick and effective comeback you have to switch over to more active modes all right and my next piece of advice if Time: 09:40 - 09:50 you're lazy visualize the outcome how will you feel if you get the grades you want how will you feel if you get that a end up on the honor roll or end up in the top 10% of your class I want you to Time: 09:50 - 10:00 actually close your eyes as you're imagining this as corny as that sounds try to legitimately feel that sense of catharsis and relief that achieving your goals is going to bring now channel that Time: 10:00 - 10:10 feeling and use it to get rid of that laziness find that spark you need to give your work your all and you can also Imagine things Beyond school for example Time: 10:10 - 10:20 Career Success the amount of money that you're make the things that you're going to own try to picture whatever it is that's going to motivate you but let's say unfortunately that doesn't work what then now I'm not as big a fan of this Time: 10:20 - 10:30 method but imagine the opposite how would you feel if you continue being lazy if you don't put in the work I think positive reinforcement is a much healthier and more effective way of Time: 10:30 - 10:40 gaining motivation but sometimes a pinch of negative reinforcement especially when you really don't feel like working can kind of go a long way guys I believe Time: 10:40 - 10:50 in you and I know you have what it takes to make the academic comeback you need if you need more support feel free to check out my Discord server huge thank you again to Surf Truck for sponsoring this video and I'll see you again next Time: 10:50 - 11:00 week Time: 11:00 - 11:101 like = 1 hour studying (pls guys i have an exam in 3 weeks ) Update : sorry guys if i kept yall waiting but the exams took place during 2 weeks  and now im done with them, im still waiting for my results tho wish me luck :) (Btw aint no way i can possibly study 1100 hours in 3 weeks 💀)",

00:20 started your work why is it so hard to start your work and how can you be more productive and before we jump into the video if you're a high school student or know a high school student that needs Time: 00:20 - 00:30 help improving their grades and applying to college check out next admit the link is in my description we do college essay reviews we hop on consultation calls with students and we're also soon launching something called the high Time: 00:30 - 00:40 school roadmap you can learn more about it and find the link to the wait list in my description below so a mice and productivity Guru that's grinding 24 7. of course not but I did grind throughout Time: 00:40 - 00:50 all four years of high school then all four years of college and I did learn a few things along the way chances are if you're struggling to start your work your inflating reality and the reason Time: 00:50 - 01:00 this is happening is because you're stockpiling your work so when you get an assignment you just put it in your calendar and that's that but I recommend that when you get an assignment try to Time: 01:00 - 01:10 figure out how long it actually is and even predict how long you think it'll take you to complete it if you just take assignments and throw them onto your to-do list without actually looking at Time: 01:10 - 01:20 them you're just gonna feel overwhelmed in your head all you're going to be thinking is oh my God I have these five assignments that I haven't even started I don't know where to begin what to do for them Etc but if you take some time Time: 01:20 - 01:30 to at least look at your assignments and have some grasp on reality you'll feel way less overwhelmed when it's time to start your work at the end of the day Time: 01:30 - 01:40 this is how much work you have to do and this is what it feels like inside your head and by at least taking the time to read through your assignments and predict how long they'll take you this Time: 01:40 - 01:50 is what it'll start to feel like alright once you've stopped inflating reality and grounded your expectations I think the next step is to gain some sense of control now this this might not be Time: 01:50 - 02:00 feasible all the time but as soon as you get an assignment try to answer just the first question right then and there if it's an essay maybe try to Bullet some ideas or even write your first sentence Time: 02:00 - 02:10 the reason this at least worked for me is because once I started my work in school as soon as I got home I felt way less overwhelmed about starting I didn't Time: 02:10 - 02:20 need to muster up that activation energy to get the ball rolling and by the time I got home instead of feeling that dread of having to start a homework assignment I just had to keep the momentum going Time: 02:20 - 02:30 and that leads into my next Point try to create an after-school routine and if you can just start your work as soon as you get home now of course you can take a break but I recommend using a timer Time: 02:30 - 02:40 take a break for 15 minutes 30 minutes even 45 minutes make sure you have a defined cut off point for when you stop relaxing and start working now chances Time: 02:40 - 02:50 are even when it's time to start working maybe you still feel unmotivated maybe starting your work in school wasn't enough to make it easier to start your work once you got home and if that's the Time: 02:50 - 03:00 case I recommend focusing on the minimum viable step when you know you have to start your work you probably feel overwhelmed just think okay I have to go Time: 03:00 - 03:10 and sit at my desk and that's it don't think about all the other things you have to do don't think about all the other steps in the process just do the Time: 03:10 - 03:20 simplest and easiest thing you possibly can in that moment to get started and maybe it's not even going to your desk maybe it's just standing up but do whatever you have to do to even make a Time: 03:20 - 03:30 tiny amount of progress okay now all of this is well and good but let's assume you have a bunch of tasks what order should you tackle them in alright so Time: 03:30 - 03:40 something I did back in school and something I do even to this day is practice something called fixed before flexible okay so bear with me some tasks are fixed meaning that they'll usually Time: 03:40 - 03:50 take some concrete defined amount of time for example every day I try to read for 30 minutes I try to work out for one hour I might do something else for 45 Time: 03:50 - 04:00 minutes these tasks take up a fixed amount of time now flexible tasks on the other hand might vary writing an essay might take 30 minutes it might take two hours who really knows so tasks that Time: 04:00 - 04:10 don't take up a defined amount of time are flexible tasks and now before I put this whole idea together I want to explain a third concept Parkinson's law Time: 04:10 - 04:20 this informal law states work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion so here's the way fixed before flexible works you have all of Time: 04:20 - 04:30 this time in the day if you do your flexible tasks first because you haven't created bounds or figured out when you're going to do your fixed tasks these flexible tasks according to Parkinson's law are just going to expand Time: 04:30 - 04:40 and take up all your time and this way you'll probably have way less time for your fixed tasks or might not be able to complete them whatsoever but if you do Time: 04:40 - 04:50 your fixed tasks first you create a constraint for these flexible tasks according to Parkinson's law yeah the tasks might take up the rest of your time but at least you made time for those fixed tasks and now you get to Time: 04:50 - 05:00 complete everything another tool I loved using to be more productive and get more stuff done was a timer just having that pressure of the timer running would Time: 05:00 - 05:10 really keep me focused on the tasks that I had to complete next another thing that I love to do throughout high school was to evenly distribute everything so if I got assigned a 70 page reading that Time: 05:10 - 05:20 was due in a week I would simply read 10 pages every day if I had a math assignment that was 28 questions I would do four questions Every Day Distributing my work evenly just made life a lot Time: 05:20 - 05:30 easier and prevented me from doing all my work at the last minute now of course there were times when I didn't do this and I did push things off until the last minute and that was not fun but Time: 05:30 - 05:40 regardless I always did my best to follow this rule okay and I just remembered there was one other random technique that I would sometimes use in school it's called the countdown method Time: 05:40 - 05:50 so starting your work in school or finding the minimum viable step doesn't help you start your work just give yourself a countdown you can count down from 10 five three it doesn't matter but Time: 05:50 - 06:00 as soon as the countdown is over you should find that impulse to just jump up and start your work might not always work but it could come in handy and lastly it is impossible to be a machine Time: 06:00 - 06:10 that's just working and getting stuff done 24 7. so do remember to take breaks you can take a five minute break every 30 minutes you could do a 15 minute Time: 06:10 - 06:20 break every two hours find a system or routine that works for you because everyone has different levels of energy Time: 06:20 - 06:30Gohar Khan is probably that one kid at school that could play video games during the whole class and still gets the highest grades.",

00:20 nap wait what first day of school the new school year is right around the corner and this is going to be your year this is going to be the year build Time: 00:20 - 00:30 better study habits get better grades crush your extracurriculars and even get enough sleep well hopefully in this video I'm going to cover eight tips to help you make this your best school year Time: 00:30 - 00:40 yet tip number one you're not who you were last year chances are you're taking harder courses this year than you did last year and it makes sense if you feel nervous especially if you didn't do that Time: 00:40 - 00:50 well in your classes last year but I've noticed that students approach this feeling in one of two ways either with a fixed mindset or a growth mindset having that growth mindset is critical if you Time: 00:50 - 01:00 want to do well this school year a growth mindset is when you believe you can develop your intelligence and your skills through hard work for example let's say you get a c on a test instead Time: 01:00 - 01:10 of seeing that c as a setback you see that as an opportunity to develop your study habits and get a better grade on the next exam now a person with the fixed mindset on the other hand believes Time: 01:10 - 01:20 their skills and intelligence are set in stone so if they get a Cen test they're just going to assume that's how the world works and they're going to think there's nothing they can do to improve their grade but I'm here to tell you Time: 01:20 - 01:30 something special if you are watching this video it means you have a growth mindset because you believe that by listening to the advice in this video that you can improve your academic Time: 01:30 - 01:40 performance now just to give you an idea of how powerful a growth mindset can be a paper from Stanford Professor Carol DWI who actually coined these terms growth mindset and fixed mindset found Time: 01:40 - 01:50 that students with a growth mindset consistently outperformed those with a fixed mindset here's a quote from one of her papers although students with more of a fixed mindset and students with more growth mindset entered junior high Time: 01:50 - 02:00 school with identical past achievement test scores their math grades differed by the end of their first term and diverged increasingly over the next 2 years students with a growth mindset Time: 02:00 - 02:10 showed continuous Improvement those with the fixed mindset did not tip number two is to declutter everything and this one's actually pretty fun going into the new school year you're going to Time: 02:10 - 02:20 declutter in two stages first you're going to declutter your digital workspace and then you're going to declutter your physical workspace so to declutter your digital workspace I want you to head to Google Drive select that Time: 02:20 - 02:30 mess of files that's just sitting there and move everything into a folder called archive boom there we go everything probably looks way cleaner now but we're not done just yet now I want you to Time: 02:30 - 02:40 create three folders called classes extracurriculars and other in the classes folder you're going to create a folder for each of your classes and you're going to color code them according to this guide look this is the Time: 02:40 - 02:50 only correct way to do it if you disagree you can argue in the comments in the extracurriculars folder you're going to create a folder for each of your clubs and activities and then in the other folder is where you you'll Time: 02:50 - 03:00 keep everything else and of course you can also add other folders like personal finance and health but these are the four base folders that I think every student needs oh and by the way if you have any important documents in that Time: 03:00 - 03:10 archive folder just pull it out and move it where you need it to be oh and also clean out your email inbox because I know you have thousands of unread emails unsubscribe from newsletters you don't care about subscribe to my newsletter Time: 03:10 - 03:20 which is linked in the description and then also delete any messages that you don't really need anymore now decluttering your physical workspace on the other hand is a bit more straightforward get rid of all the garbage that's in your backpack get rid Time: 03:20 - 03:30 of all the garbage that's on your desk and also get a desk organizer to store all your stationery this way if you're ever at your desk and your backpack's far away you don't have to trudge across your room or the entire house to get Time: 03:30 - 03:40 what you need tip number three is to reduce the noise you have to eliminate any distractions that can hold you back this school year I want you to grab your phone and delete any apps that are Time: 03:40 - 03:50 wasting your time and don't do this Based On A vibe check look at your screen time and look at the apps that you are using the most every single week now I either want you to delete these apps or set up time limits but make sure Time: 03:50 - 04:00 your time limits aren't too aggressive like don't set a time limit for 5 or 10 minutes because chances are whenever that notification pops up you're just going to dismiss it instead look at your average usage and set your time limit Time: 04:00 - 04:10 accordingly for example if you're using YouTube for an hour a day preferably to watch my videos start off by setting your time limit to 45 minutes a day then the following week you can set it to 30 Time: 04:10 - 04:20 minutes a day but jumping straight from an hour to 30 minutes or even 15 minutes might feel a bit too aggressive now if you want to go even one step further I recommend that you use Focus mode which Time: 04:20 - 04:30 will block out notifications from people and apps for a certain amount of time iOS already comes with the work Focus that you can use whenever you need to lock in but even then let's say you still get distracted and cannot focus Time: 04:30 - 04:40 for the life of you I have a quote or I guess a question that I want you to think about how do I want to wake up tomorrow I heard this from Dr K who is a phenomenal YouTuber who I actually met Time: 04:40 - 04:50 recently and it felt like a huge wakeup call for me like just think to yourself if you don't do your work right now how will you feel the next morning and that thought alone should be enough to motivate you all right tip number four Time: 04:50 - 05:00 is to lean in and this really isn't a tip this is more of a request whatever you're interested in whether it's programming biology chemistry music movies I want you to go all in not only Time: 05:00 - 05:10 will this be fulfilling for you but colleges love to see students who are passionate and committed to something for example let's say you're interested Time: 05:10 - 05:20 in sustainability and want to start an organization to clean up litter in your community I want you to think of a name find people to join you create an action plan and build a website to spread the word but building a website can be kind Time: 05:20 - 05:30 of tough which is where the sponsor of this video comes in Fiverr Fiverr is the best place to find worldclass Freelancers to help you with digital work think graphic design video editing Time: 05:30 - 05:40 web development pretty much all the skills you would need to start up a passion project let's head over to Fiverr and use their new AI tool Neo to find the perfect freelancer to build the Time: 05:40 - 05:50 web page for our organization we're going to share information about what we're working on which in this case is a landing page for a sustainability organization and quickly Neo will provide us with a list of freelancer Time: 05:50 - 06:00 options now I know what you're thinking you probably don't have a huge budget for your organization which is fine you can adjust the filters to find Freelancers who are in your price range and it's also super easy to vet the Time: 06:00 - 06:10 quality of these Freelancers by looking at their ratings or their portfolios their ratings are based on previous projects they have worked on and their portfolios will give you a sense of the quality to expect a few days ago I Time: 06:10 - 06:20 reached out to a freelancer on Fiverr to build the landing page for this organization I reached out to savior who clearly knows what they're doing in terms of design we had a little back and Time: 06:20 - 06:30 forth about the project details and within a couple days they came back to me with a fully functional website now you can use Fiverr for a lot more than just web development you can also use it for video editing you can also use it Time: 06:30 - 06:40 for graphic design the point here is to make sure that you are focusing on the parts of the project that matter most and delegate everything else so in the case of this organization you would need Time: 06:40 - 06:50 to spend most of your time getting people on board and hosting initiatives and it's the Freelancers on Fiverr that can help with everything else so you can bring your vision to life head over to fiber. c/g goart to check out the Time: 06:50 - 07:00 services available to you and use code goart for 10% off and now let's get back to the video tip number five is to create an organization system before the Time: 07:00 - 07:10 year starts you need a place where you can keep track of all your academic and all your extracurricular responsibilities however not all organization systems are created equal I Time: 07:10 - 07:20 find that students use organization systems that span four different levels now the level that's the best fit for you depends on the kind of person you are and the amount of stuff that you have to do person personally I use a Time: 07:20 - 07:30 level four system today so level one is using a pen and a notebook which I believe is highly underrated many people assume that a pen and a notebook isn't enough but in reality at the heart of Time: 07:30 - 07:40 any good productivity system is having a place where you can write down what you have to do and then track what you have done a to-do list in your notebook helps you do just that level two is using a Time: 07:40 - 07:50 digital to-do list usually with an app like to-do list or even the reminders app on your iPhone by the way the reminders app has some pretty cool secrets that a lot of people don't know about for example on a reminder you can Time: 07:50 - 08:00 set a location so that it pops up whenever you're in a specific place so if you set the location as your house the reminder will pop up whenever you come home from school which can be pretty useful you can also toggle Time: 08:00 - 08:10 something called when messaging which will show you the reminder whenever you're texting someone in particular so for example if you're working with someone on a group project this would be a pretty useful toggle to activate level Time: 08:10 - 08:20 three is using a calendar app like Google calendar and calendar apps are beneficial because you can track what you have to do and then also when you're going to do them I highly recommend Time: 08:20 - 08:30 using a calendar app if you're an upper classman because I imagine that you are juggling a ton of different things create blocks in your calendar for classes extracurriculars study sessions Time: 08:30 - 08:40 workouts and everything else this method of creating blocks in your calendar is known as time blocking which I believe is extremely useful if you're a student because students drastically Time: 08:40 - 08:50 overestimate the amount of time they have only when you time block your responsibilities do you get a sense of how quickly you have to work and when you have to work now level four is using Time: 08:50 - 09:00 a productivity app like notion to create an operating system for your life some people also call this a second brain this is a digital system that allows you to track your assignments your exams Time: 09:00 - 09:10 your extracurriculars your workout routine your finances your college applications and so so much more later this fall I'm actually going to release my own oce template which I believe is Time: 09:10 - 09:20 the ultimate system for students who want to stay organized and get ahead in every aspect of their life if you want to be notified when it comes out fill out the interest form in the description of this video tip number six study when Time: 09:20 - 09:30 you don't have to I can already imagine what you're thinking this is illogical this doesn't make sense go hard what are you talking about but this is the ultimate life hack if you only study Time: 09:30 - 09:40 when you have to there are going to be some weeks when you barely have to study and some weeks when you are studying a ton and this constant fluctuation can get pretty stressful as a student but if Time: 09:40 - 09:50 you instead study the same amount every single week even when you don't really have anything to study you will feel so much calmer as a student for example if you don't have a lot of stuff to study Time: 09:50 - 10:00 one week just read ahead so that by the time you do have to study a lot you don't have to panic because you've already read ahead so while your friends and classmates might be going through this stressful cycle of ups and downs Time: 10:00 - 10:10 you are maintaining this calm consistency and doing just as well if not better tip number seven don't do it solo the reason I did so well in high Time: 10:10 - 10:20 school is because my best friend challenged me we were on the exact same wavelength we had the exact same goals we had the exact same vision and having that person in my life helped me stay motivated why because I had someone Time: 10:20 - 10:30 holding me to higher standards someone who was cheering me on and someone who could support me in times that I was feeling super stressed for example while I was going through the college application process my friend and I Time: 10:30 - 10:40 helped each other stay on top of everything because we both were applying to the exact same schools we were able to keep each other in check and keep each other motivated if you can find someone in your life whether it's an Time: 10:40 - 10:50 adult a friend a family member a parent to be that source of inspiration or support you are going to excel this school year now if you don't have someone in your life who can hold you to Time: 10:50 - 11:00 these goals don't worry because you have this community drop a comment with what your goals are for this year and try to make it detailed don't just say I want better grades okay and if you're watching this video days weeks or even Time: 11:00 - 11:10 months after I published it I want you to go into the comments and check in on the people who left the comment see how their goals are going and see if they're staying consistent and tip number eight Time: 11:10 - 11:20 is to get on your teachers good side it is critical to do this as early as possible and here's how you're going to do it without looking like a teacher's pet within the classroom try to answer a question most classes don't try to Time: 11:20 - 11:30 answer every single question because then you'll just look like a tryhard your goal is to show that you care about the class and show that you're engaged and then of course you also want to ask Time: 11:30 - 11:40 questions but make them thoughtful for example don't ask your teacher to define a term or repeat what they've already said instead ask them a question that they might have to think about for a second and these tend to be the Time: 11:40 - 11:50 questions that start with the why or a how if you want to go even further you can email them a question after class though I feel most teachers are kind of split about this some might be impressed Time: 11:50 - 12:00 by the email and appreciate your thoughtfulness others might think that you're just being lazy and should look up the stuff yourself and finally getting on your teacher's good side isn't just about getting good grades and being smart it's also about getting your Time: 12:00 - 12:10 teacher to like you as a person so be friendly with them chat with them before and after class and Don't Force It just try to be a genuinely kind thoughtful and interested person and I guarantee Time: 12:10 - 12:20 you that your teachers will like you and with that we have wrapped up today's video if you haven't already join my Discord server where we have over 170,000 students from around the world Time: 12:20 -

      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:10 problem no problem okay what are you doing what are you doing stop that Time: 00:10 - 00:20 please please stop I mean I know the feeling I know how it feels to strain your wrist and your neck as you're trying to copy down everything your teacher says but in these instances not Time: 00:20 - 00:30 taking is often a comfort mechanism and not necessarily a learning mechanism scribbling everything down as fast as possible gives us a false sense of Time: 00:30 - 00:40 progress Although our hands are active our mind usually isn't in this video I'm going to talk about five common note-taking mistakes and how to fix them all right mistake number one Time: 00:40 - 00:50 transcribing instead of translating so as we covered at the start of this video you should never transcribe your lecture if you are trying to copy down every single word you're teach teacher says Time: 00:50 - 01:00 you're probably doing yourself a disservice why because you can most likely find the lecture recordings and the lecture slides online we often rush to take notes because it excuses us from Time: 01:00 - 01:10 the harder and more important task thinking in fact I argue that many students would be better off taking zero notes during lecture and forcing Time: 01:10 - 01:20 themselves to pay attention instead but chances are you don't want to do that and fair you probably should write something down during lecture so let me tell you a better way to to take notes Time: 01:20 - 01:30 instead of transcribing which is writing everything down verbatim focus on translating which is writing things down in your own words as your professor Time: 01:30 - 01:40 speaks avoid the urge to continuously write instead I want you to take notes in chunks focus on your professor's words for 10 to 20 seconds let it digest and then write the main points in your Time: 01:40 - 01:50 own words if you've never taken notes like this before it's going to feel uncomfortable because it'll feel like you're glossing over the important stuff the diagrams the the facts the dates the Time: 01:50 - 02:00 events but the truth is you can revisit all these specific Minor Details on your own time what you will not have access to later however is your professors and Time: 02:00 - 02:10 the overarching themes and ideas they want to convey in fact these are often the ideas your professor might communicate on the spot and in the moment they might not be available in a textbook or some external resource Time: 02:10 - 02:20 here's another way to think about it learning is like Pottery you focus on the overall shape and structure first and then once you have that in place you can go in and focus on the Minor Details Time: 02:20 - 02:30 and patterns to bring your Masterpiece to life knowledge Works similarly instead of going right into the little details you need to create the structure Time: 02:30 - 02:40 first and this is often through the key themes and messages and ideas and then once you have a sense of what you're learning and why you're learning it then you can drill down with all the Minor Details to refine your understanding all Time: 02:40 - 02:50 this comes back to the one lesson that I preach on this channel over and over again discomfort is a byproduct of learning actively engage engaging with Time: 02:50 - 03:00 your professor's words instead of passively copying everything down is hard and most students won't want to do that but you can either actively engage during lecture and trim down your study Time: 03:00 - 03:10 time outside of class or you can passively engage and drastically extend your study sessions mistake number two obsessing over form now what do I mean by this by Form I'm referring to the Time: 03:10 - 03:20 aesthetic and the format of your notes now I don't mean to sound like a hater when I'm saying this but aesthetically pleasing notes are very over at if you Time: 03:20 - 03:30 want to decorate your notes and make them look pretty outside of class please by all means do so and don't let me stop you but do not obsess over the aesthetic while you're in lecture for two reasons Time: 03:30 - 03:40 first the more you focus on the aesthetic the less you focus on the actual lecture embellishing your notes just gives you a false sense of productivity and second you'll be in a Time: 03:40 - 03:50 constant state of panic trying to keep up with your professor and so again we run into this issue where you're not actively engaging with the lecture content okay now let's talk about the Time: 03:50 - 04:00 format of your notes some of the smartest students I know obsess over the format and rightfully so they want to make sure that their notes are neat and organized to maximize their learning but Time: 04:00 - 04:10 my advice don't overthink it choose a format that works for you and run with it for example if you don't like Cornell notes don't use Cornell notes because some academic Guru told you that they Time: 04:10 - 04:20 were effective which they are by the way but I totally understand why you might not be a fan of them again what matters more is the process of not taking itself for example are you actively engaging Time: 04:20 - 04:30 are you processing ideas in your own words are you focusing on the key themes and messages that's what matters more but I would be remiss if I didn't at Time: 04:30 - 04:40 least tell you what the different note-taking formats are so let's run through them quickly again if any of these resonate with you great if not keep doing you first we have the good old outline method and this is the Time: 04:40 - 04:50 notetaking method that carried me throughout high school and college and the premise is pretty simple organize information hierarchically hierarch hierarchically is that how you say that Time: 04:50 - 05:00 use bullets to put main topics at the top followed by subtopics underneath I prefer this format because it gives me the most space to work with which isn't necessarily the case with the second Time: 05:00 - 05:10 format Cornell notes so for Cornell notes you want to divide your page into three sections in narrow left column for cues and questions a wider right column for the notes themselves and then a Time: 05:10 - 05:20 section at the bottom for summaries a benefit of this structure is that it forces active engagement with the electure material but a drawback is that it takes a lot more time time after Time: 05:20 - 05:30 class or maybe even during class you're going to have to remember to fill out that summary section for every single page now if you're not a fan of writing summaries then you might be a fan of Time: 05:30 - 05:40 this third format the box method now I'll admit this one is a bit unusual and I've never used it myself but the idea is simple group similar notes together and box them this can provide clear Time: 05:40 - 05:50 visual separation between distinct ideas which can make studying a lot easier but my favorite not taking format at least the one to study with are mind m Maps Time: 05:50 - 06:00 mind maps are great because they reflect the interconnected nature of knowledge you have a central idea in the middle and then you have related ideas branching off and then you can integrate distinct colors with separate areas of Time: 06:00 - 06:10 the Mind map to help with memory retention but I know what you're wondering goart didn't you say you used the outline method during school and not mind maps that's correct I used the Time: 06:10 - 06:20 outline method to take notes during class but I used mind maps to study outside of class mind maps can get very messy if you're using them dur in lecture because you might not know when Time: 06:20 - 06:30 to split a branch into a sub Branch or when to use different colors that's why I think that mind maps are instead useful when you're familiar with the concept and understand the surrounding Time: 06:30 - 06:40 landscape once you've acquired knowledge you can then use a mind map to make sense of it and see how everything fits together you know what else should fit together your study tools which is why I want to show you something cool that Time: 06:40 - 06:50 Opera is doing they've partnered with Spotify to reimagine the way we listen to music while working and it gets even better right now Opera is offering three months of Spotify Premium for free that Time: 06:50 - 07:00 means you can listen without ads download your music to listen anytime anywhere and organize your playlist to listen in whatever order you want you can claim your free trial by downloading Time: 07:00 - 07:10 the Opera browser and heading to the Opera player sidebar just note that this offer varies by country now let me show you Opera in action especially the video pop out feature you can detach the video Time: 07:10 - 07:20 you're watching so and place it anywhere on your screen keeping it on top of other windows this is super helpful for those who love to watch while they browse but don't want to keep switching Time: 07:20 - 07:30 between tabs but what I really love is how customizable Opera is watch this I can set a theme like Midsummer adjust the colors add some subtle sound effects and create the perfect environment for Time: 07:30 - 07:40 focusing head to the link in my description to download Opera today and claim your free Spotify Premium offer and now back to the video mistake number three ignoring your inner monologue so Time: 07:40 - 07:50 you know that voice inside your head during lecture the one that's like oh wait this doesn't make any sense or wait how does that work capture these thoughts in your notes doing so is a Time: 07:50 - 08:00 great way to reflect on the material and to make your notes much more memorable for example as I'm reading a book I will annotate my exact thoughts in the margins if I find something funny I will Time: 08:00 - 08:10 write down LOL or if I find something weird I'll say WTF followed by an explanation or sometimes if we're talking about a person that reminds me of someone that I know or if we're Time: 08:10 - 08:20 talking about an event that reminds me of something that I've experienced I will also note that down the more personal you can make your notes and connect these distinct Concepts to your own lived experiences the easier it's Time: 08:20 - 08:30 going to be to retain that information the most important type of annotation though in my opinion is the question mark if something confuses you anything Time: 08:30 - 08:40 confuses you during lecture even for just a moment write down a question mark in the margin and in the moment not later not via email not after class raise your hand and ask for Time: 08:40 - 08:50 clarification because I promise you the ideas that you're telling yourself you'll revisit on your own time you won't you will probably forget about it as soon as lecture ends and also over Time: 08:50 - 09:00 the course of the semester you'll encounter more material than you can possibly imagine and you will not have time to go back through everything and see which parts confused you those question marks will be your indicators Time: 09:00 - 09:10 and they will guide your study sessions so this way you can skip over the self-explanatory Concepts and double down on what confuses you mistake number four failing to contextualize knowledge Time: 09:10 - 09:20 doesn't exist in isolation when you learn something new it's probably connected to something you've learned previously or it's related to an adjacent Topic in a different class your Time: 09:20 - 09:30 knowledge exists in the shape of a tree in other words it looks kind of like a mind map when you take notes on a new topic you have to embed it in your knowledge Network in other words you Time: 09:30 - 09:40 have to take this new piece of information and connect it to an old piece of information if you fail to establish these connections your new knowledge will exist in isolation and Time: 09:40 - 09:50 slowly wither away over time but what does this process look like how do you actually create these connections and contextualize your knowledge well I have have three methods for you method number Time: 09:50 - 10:00 one is to include callbacks if you're taking notes on a topic that feels familiar say so in your notes literally write down something like this reminds me of the theorems we learned last week Time: 10:00 - 10:10 or this reminds me of reaction rates in chemistry you can embed these callbacks into your notes as you're taking them or you can add them to the margins after class now an even stronger way to Time: 10:10 - 10:20 contextualize your knowledge is Method number two draw comparisons callbacks are great but they're simple you're creating a connection without EXP exploring the basis for that connection Time: 10:20 - 10:30 to further solidify your knowledge include a call back followed by a point of similarity or a point of differentiation for example let's say you're taking notes on photosynthesis a Time: 10:30 - 10:40 call back might be this Builds on our study of cellular respiration then a point of similarity might be both processes involve energy conversion and Time: 10:40 - 10:50 then if you want to take it even further a point of differentiation might be photosynthesis stores energy in glucose whereas cellular respiration releases it now you don't have have to do this with Time: 10:50 - 11:00 all your notes all the time but it's an especially useful exercise if you're studying for an exam and want to make sense of different concepts okay and then method number three map it out as I Time: 11:00 - 11:10 said earlier mind maps are a great study tool in addition to taking notes during class I also recommend that you have a mind map that you build out over the course of a semester or a unit after Time: 11:10 - 11:20 each lecture come back to this mind map and see if you can find a place to fit in these new Concepts that you just learned the more connections you can draw between these new Concepts and the Time: 11:20 - 11:30 existing topics on your mind map the better off you're going to be all right and then mistake number five this is perhaps one of the biggest mistakes students make when taking notes doing a single pass let me explain no student is Time: 11:30 - 11:40 going to take perfect notes on the first go but what do most students do they take their notes they close their notebooks and they don't revisit them Time: 11:40 - 11:50 until exam time or better yet just never at all here's what I think you should do instead after you finish taking your notes great put them away and go about about your day but after 24 hours or Time: 11:50 - 12:00 even the same night I want you to revisit what you wrote down what you'll notice is that some of the stuff might not make sense to you or some of the stuff you might want to flesh out even Time: 12:00 - 12:10 further this is the exercise and these are the realizations that separate decent students from phenomenal students because it's uncomfortable taking notes is the easy part using your notes to Time: 12:10 - 12:20 test Challenge and solidify your understanding is the harder and the more important part in this whole process so as you're taking notes consider leaving Time: 12:20 - 12:30 gaps every few lines so you have space to come back and refine your thoughts you'll want to revisit your notes shortly after you've taken them maybe even the night of and then you'll want to revisit them 3 days later and then 5 Time: 12:30 - 12:40 days later and 2 weeks later and so on this of course is the principle of space repetition which I'm sure every study tuber on this platform has talked about the idea is to revisit your notes at Time: 12:40 - 12:50 increasing intervals to prevent the knowledge from decaying use these blank lines to elaborate on any points or to clarify confusing details and at the the same time quiz yourself as you're going Time: 12:50 - 13:00 through your notes rereading your notes is a bit overrated you also want to actively quiz yourself as you're doing so so review a chunk cover it up with a piece of paper and then try to recite Time: 13:00 - 13:10 the main points in your own words better yet take your notes and pretend you're teaching that material to someone else this of course is the fan technique which I've talked about in previous Time: 13:10 - 13:20 videos and this study method is one I lived by especially for my social studies courses the overarching idea here is that your notes shouldn't just be some stale resource that you create once and then abandon rather your notes Time: 13:20 - 13:30 should be a resource that you revisit review and refine over the course of a semester y'all that does it for today's video if you have a moment please take a Time: 13:30 - 13:40 minute or two to leave a meaningful comment and let me know what resonated most with you and also if you want to excel in school and organize everything you have going on check out my notion Time: 13:40 - 13:50 template which is linked in the description of this video y'all best of luck this school year I hope 2025 is treating you right and I'll see you again next week Time: 13:50 - 14:00Gohar i found out how to cheat on my tests, i first take the notes my teacher gave me, she said all the things we took notes down will be on the test, so i thinked of a way to always cheat on tests. It always slips under their noses. First. You want to take the notes. Step 2. Now you want to keep looking over the notes, over, over, and over again, till you memorize each thing. Step 3. Once your done. On the day of the test. You practically have the answer key in your head. Its full proof.",

Relating aesthetic,\nI've got used on keeping and making them aesthetic, so that I'm able to study ,\naka stay organized..\nFor me during the class I have the \"messy notes\" which are important things\nmy teacher says that I won't find in textbook or powerpoints.. Then in my main\nnote taking notebook I write them down and after finishing (I made sure I\nunderstood everything, write in my way, ask ai to help me In any gaps) then I\nstart either memorizing, practicing, depends on subject.\nFor questions in class, if it's a question that would take a long time to explain or\ntoo complicated, I like to keep it to myself so when I come back to study, I'd\nask ai (perplexity or gpt) to explain and help understand.. Then if there is still a\ngap I'd ask my teacher the next day..\n9:50 I",
