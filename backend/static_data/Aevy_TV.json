      "transcript": "Time: 00:02 - 00:05 talking about social transformation Time: 00:05 - 00:07 economic transformation no cities in the Time: 00:07 - 00:10 history of human civilization as we know Time: 00:10 - 00:13 that was able to do Time: 00:13 - 00:15 this it all started when I kept seeing Time: 00:15 - 00:17 these posts everywhere about India Time: 00:17 - 00:20 becoming a Time: 00:20 - 00:22 superpower you know the ones where Time: 00:22 - 00:24 everyone's saying how we are going to be Time: 00:24 - 00:26 China become the world's Factory and Time: 00:26 - 00:29 honestly with all these opinions flying Time: 00:29 - 00:31 around I started questioning what is Time: 00:31 - 00:34 actually happening in China right Time: 00:34 - 00:37 now I mean for the last 20 years they've Time: 00:37 - 00:40 been making everything that phone you're Time: 00:40 - 00:43 watching this on Chinese your laptop Time: 00:43 - 00:46 probably Chinese even the new electric Time: 00:46 - 00:48 cars everyone's talking about yep those Time: 00:48 - 00:50 are Chinese too and you know the crazy Time: 00:50 - 00:53 part this was a country that was once Time: 00:53 - 00:55 poorer than Africa so the question is Time: 00:55 - 00:58 how did they pull this off what is the Time: 00:58 - 01:01 secret sauce you know everyone's got Time: 01:01 - 01:04 opinions about China but how many people Time: 01:04 - 01:06 have actually been there to see what is Time: 01:06 - 01:08 happening so when we got the chance we Time: 01:08 - 01:11 decided to do something about Time: 01:11 - 01:14 it our team was builting shenen the Time: 01:14 - 01:17 Silicon Valley of China for a project so Time: 01:17 - 01:19 we took this opportunity to study and Time: 01:19 - 01:21 learn about what China is really like Time: 01:21 - 01:24 they visited factories spoke to so many Time: 01:24 - 01:26 Natives and saw the actual state of the Time: 01:26 - 01:28 city let me show you what we found cuz Time: 01:28 - 01:30 trust me it was nothing like what we had Time: 01:30 - 01:34 expected now before we begin our trip Time: 01:38 - 01:40 through China and show you all that we Time: 01:40 - 01:42 discovered and learned here's something Time: 01:42 - 01:44 interesting have you ever thought about Time: 01:44 - 01:47 what makes a country grow okay so Time: 01:47 - 01:49 there's this economist Robert solo who Time: 01:49 - 01:52 kind of got it right he says it's three Time: 01:52 - 01:54 things Capital labor and Technology the Time: 01:54 - 01:58 country start by building stuff that's Time: 01:58 - 02:00 factories machines infrastructure but Time: 02:00 - 02:03 there's the catch there's a limit to how Time: 02:03 - 02:05 much you can grow just by building Time: 02:05 - 02:07 things the real game changer is actually Time: 02:07 - 02:10 technology so let's begin our journey Time: 02:10 - 02:13 through China the first surprise Time: 02:13 - 02:14 actually hit our team as soon as they Time: 02:14 - 02:17 landed you know how we always complain Time: 02:17 - 02:19 about pollution in our cities so just Time: 02:19 - 02:21 out of curiosity they did a quick aqi Time: 02:21 - 02:23 check there guess what the number was 31 Time: 02:23 - 02:27 that two in an industrial house Time: 02:27 - 02:30 not bad at all right but that was just Time: 02:30 - 02:32 the beginning our first real interesting Time: 02:32 - 02:34 experience of the Chinese Tech and Time: 02:34 - 02:36 automation that we have been hearing Time: 02:36 - 02:38 about came from the taxi driver you know Time: 02:38 - 02:41 how we're also used to Google Maps right Time: 02:41 - 02:43 he wasn't using Google Maps he was using Time: 02:43 - 02:45 something called aaps and I want you Time: 02:45 - 02:47 guys to see this now this app wasn't Time: 02:47 - 02:50 just showing directions it was actually Time: 02:50 - 02:52 showing real time traffic signals and Time: 02:52 - 02:55 speed cameras every traffic light every Time: 02:55 - 02:58 speed trap literally everything was on Time: 02:58 - 03:00 this so when the taxi driver was asked Time: 03:00 - 03:02 about it he shared that it was made by Time: 03:02 - 03:04 Alibaba and everyone there is using it Time: 03:04 - 03:07 and apparently it's extremely accurate Time: 03:07 - 03:10 and finally they arrived at their hotel Time: 03:10 - 03:12 just a regular Hotel nothing fancy and Time: 03:12 - 03:15 what do they find robots no display Time: 03:15 - 03:18 pieces but actual working robots moving Time: 03:18 - 03:21 around getting into elevators by Time: 03:21 - 03:23 themselves delivering stuff to rooms now Time: 03:23 - 03:26 obviously this will get anybody Time: 03:26 - 03:27 intrigued so they ask the receptionist Time: 03:27 - 03:29 about it and she shared that this is Time: 03:29 - 03:31 literally found in almost all hotels of Time: 03:31 - 03:33 China and it actually does a bunch of Time: 03:33 - 03:35 things so the kitchen staff loads it Time: 03:35 - 03:37 with food and it automatically delivers Time: 03:37 - 03:40 the same to the rooms the receptionist Time: 03:40 - 03:42 was like we've had these for years and Time: 03:42 - 03:44 it's honestly very very common when you Time: 03:44 - 03:46 hear something crazier alibaba's been Time: 03:46 - 03:49 running a completely automated hotel in Time: 03:49 - 03:52 China since Time: 03:52 - 03:53 2018 no human staff at all how Wild is Time: 03:53 - 03:57 that now here's when things started Time: 03:57 - 03:59 getting really interesting and we also Time: 03:59 - 04:01 started learning more about the culture Time: 04:01 - 04:03 in China so when the team tried to pay Time: 04:03 - 04:05 for something with cash people literally Time: 04:05 - 04:07 looked at them like they were from Time: 04:07 - 04:08 another Century you know just like we Time: 04:08 - 04:10 have UPI in India in China as well every Time: 04:10 - 04:14 single thing happens through your phone Time: 04:14 - 04:16 but here's the interesting part most of Time: 04:16 - 04:18 it is all through one single app check Time: 04:18 - 04:22 this out this is we chat imagine if Time: 04:22 - 04:25 WhatsApp Netflix Uber PTM and Spotify Time: 04:25 - 04:29 had a baby Time: 04:29 - 04:30 that is WeChat for you you want to text Time: 04:30 - 04:32 someone WeChat you need to book a cab Time: 04:32 - 04:34 WeChat watch videos WeChat make payments Time: 04:34 - 04:37 vat it has 1.3 billion monthly active Time: 04:37 - 04:41 users equating to about 80% of China's Time: 04:41 - 04:45 population now I think I've mentioned in Time: 04:45 - 04:47 a lot of our videos how much we love Time: 04:47 - 04:49 studying infra the roads so I was asking Time: 04:49 - 04:52 my team how's the commute how the infra Time: 04:52 - 04:54 there so they made a very interesting Time: 04:54 - 04:56 observation on how almost every taxi in Time: 04:56 - 04:59 shenen is electric not some not most Time: 04:59 - 05:02 literally 99% so at first we assume that Time: 05:02 - 05:05 maybe it's just the taxis but no a large Time: 05:05 - 05:08 number of regular people are driving EVS Time: 05:08 - 05:10 too guess why China has a strange Time: 05:10 - 05:13 Lottery system for gas vehicle number Time: 05:13 - 05:15 plates so many people who've been in the Time: 05:15 - 05:17 lottery pool for longer than 5 years Time: 05:17 - 05:19 competing with more than 3 million Time: 05:19 - 05:22 fellow residents for one of these ples Time: 05:22 - 05:24 you see traffic congestion and air Time: 05:24 - 05:26 pollution are such big headaches there Time: 05:26 - 05:29 that the government since 2011 has used Time: 05:29 - 05:31 this Lottery to restrict the number of Time: 05:31 - 05:33 cars registered each year but on the Time: 05:33 - 05:36 other hand if you look at EES you can Time: 05:36 - 05:38 just walk in and drive out no Lottery no Time: 05:38 - 05:41 waiting now let me show you some Time: 05:41 - 05:43 interesting numbers around this running Time: 05:43 - 05:44 an electric vehicle there costs around Time: 05:44 - 05:47 600 Yan that's around 7,000 rupees per Time: 05:47 - 05:49 month but if you look at a gas vehicle Time: 05:49 - 05:52 that's between 1700 to 3,800 Yan that's Time: 05:52 - 05:56 18,000 to 41,800 Time: 05:56 - 05:59 rupes so the math is pretty clear right Time: 05:59 - 06:01 now this is also the reason why there's Time: 06:01 - 06:03 been such a big boom of eveve industry Time: 06:03 - 06:05 in China now coming back to the roads so Time: 06:05 - 06:08 when it came to maintaining Road Time: 06:08 - 06:09 discipline and stopping people from Time: 06:09 - 06:11 disrupting the Traffic Systems the Time: 06:11 - 06:13 government has installed AI facial Time: 06:13 - 06:15 recognition cameras and it was quite Time: 06:15 - 06:17 interesting to see because literally Time: 06:17 - 06:19 nobody not even a single person the team Time: 06:19 - 06:22 saw jumped a signal traffic light you Time: 06:22 - 06:25 know through this trip as we were Time: 06:25 - 06:27 continuously talking to our teams and Time: 06:27 - 06:29 kind of immersing ourselves in this Time: 06:29 - 06:30 high-tech environment we began to Time: 06:30 - 06:32 realize how rapidly AI is growing across Time: 06:32 - 06:35 the world and in workplaces it wasn't Time: 06:35 - 06:37 just about robots or cameras AI was Time: 06:37 - 06:39 literally present in hospitals Time: 06:39 - 06:41 classrooms grocery stores everywhere and Time: 06:41 - 06:45 witnessing these advancements firsthand Time: 06:45 - 06:47 made us realize that embracing AI is no Time: 06:47 - 06:50 longer just an option but a necessity Time: 06:50 - 06:52 for all it also made me think about M's Time: 06:52 - 06:55 law the observation of the number of Time: 06:55 - 06:57 transistors on a microchip doubles Time: 06:57 - 06:59 approximately every 2 years effectively Time: 06:59 - 07:02 doubling computing power while the cost Time: 07:02 - 07:05 halves the mura mainly talks about Time: 07:05 - 07:07 semiconductors and Hardware it also Time: 07:07 - 07:09 symbolizes the exponential Pace at which Time: 07:09 - 07:12 technology advances you know none of us Time: 07:12 - 07:13 know how much more technology will Time: 07:13 - 07:15 evolve but this experience in China Time: 07:15 - 07:17 served as a wakeup call to be prepared Time: 07:17 - 07:19 for the future to thrive in this new era Time: 07:19 - 07:22 we need to adapt and explore new ways to Time: 07:22 - 07:24 upscale and stay ahead of the curve and Time: 07:24 - 07:27 that's why we partnered with IBM to Time: 07:27 - 07:29 bring this to you IBM skills build is a Time: 07:29 - 07:31 free digital learning platform designed Time: 07:31 - 07:34 to empower individuals with the skills Time: 07:34 - 07:36 needed in today's job market whether Time: 07:36 - 07:39 you're a developer or aspiring to become Time: 07:39 - 07:41 one the new course use generative AI for Time: 07:41 - 07:44 software development is a game changer Time: 07:44 - 07:46 in this course you learn how AI can help Time: 07:46 - 07:48 you write new code switch code between Time: 07:48 - 07:51 programming languages and fix common Time: 07:51 - 07:53 coding issues you'll get hands-on Time: 07:53 - 07:55 experience using IBN Watson X in a Time: 07:55 - 07:57 simulated environment to great code Time: 07:57 - 08:00 using prompts but the best part about Time: 08:00 - 08:01 IBM's scor is that you don't have to Time: 08:01 - 08:03 burn a hole in your pocket and spend Time: 08:03 - 08:05 hours trying to complete it it's Time: 08:05 - 08:07 absolutely free and all you need to Time: 08:07 - 08:09 spend is just one hour of your time and Time: 08:09 - 08:12 gain skills which will make you ready Time: 08:12 - 08:13 for the future if you're interested in Time: 08:13 - 08:15 learning this and staying ahead in this Time: 08:15 - 08:18 rapidly evolving field I highly Time: 08:18 - 08:20 recommend checking out IBM skills build Time: 08:20 - 08:22 and their course on generative AI for Time: 08:22 - 08:24 software development I'm linking the Time: 08:24 - 08:26 course in the description below Time: 08:26 - 08:32 now you know one more important thing we Time: 08:32 - 08:34 observed in China was that automation Time: 08:34 - 08:36 wasn't something which was restricted to Time: 08:36 - 08:38 normal civilian life alone so our team Time: 08:38 - 08:40 has set up multiple meetings with Time: 08:40 - 08:42 different different vendors for one Time: 08:42 - 08:44 project that we had experimenting with Time: 08:44 - 08:45 at AOS so one of the vendors had invited Time: 08:45 - 08:48 the team to his Factory and offered a Time: 08:48 - 08:49 full tour so as the team ventured deeper Time: 08:49 - 08:52 inside the factory and reach the Time: 08:52 - 08:53 production floor they were literally Time: 08:53 - 08:56 amazed inside this massive room these Time: 08:56 - 08:58 giant machines were turnning our Time: 08:58 - 09:00 products at an unimaginable speed all in Time: 09:00 - 09:03 one go and you know what there were more Time: 09:03 - 09:05 than 20 machines and only one person Time: 09:05 - 09:09 overlooking them now it wasn't that the Time: 09:09 - 09:11 entire Factory had a single worker but Time: 09:11 - 09:13 the human to machine ratio was Time: 09:13 - 09:14 interesting the humans that were there Time: 09:14 - 09:16 they were mainly working on the assembly Time: 09:16 - 09:17 lines now apart from this there was one Time: 09:17 - 09:19 more thing that really intrigued us Time: 09:19 - 09:20 about the factory workers that's the Time: 09:20 - 09:22 wages a factory worker in China makes Time: 09:22 - 09:25 about Time: 09:25 - 09:26 8,871 per month that's about 1 lakh Time: 09:26 - 09:30 3,000 you know that's when we also Time: 09:30 - 09:32 realize something that labor in China is Time: 09:32 - 09:34 not cheap at least not anymore the Time: 09:34 - 09:36 second vendor that we had set up a Time: 09:36 - 09:37 meeting with said that this has actually Time: 09:37 - 09:40 been a pretty common myth outside China Time: 09:40 - 09:42 because it used to be a thing of the Time: 09:42 - 09:43 past when China especially shenen was Time: 09:43 - 09:46 starting to become the electronic Hub of Time: 09:46 - 09:48 the world in fact the labor costs in Time: 09:48 - 09:49 China are now more than many Asian Time: 09:49 - 09:52 countries too so the labor is not cheap Time: 09:52 - 09:54 anymore why are companies still going to Time: 09:54 - 09:56 China for manufacturing and what Time: 09:56 - 09:58 explains their unprecedent ented growth Time: 09:58 - 10:00 in manufacturing the secret Source now Time: 10:00 - 10:02 their competitive Advantage as Economist Time: 10:02 - 10:05 Michael pattis puts it unlike the usual Time: 10:05 - 10:07 make it cheaper game China wins by Time: 10:07 - 10:09 getting massive support from his Time: 10:09 - 10:11 government we're talking topnotch Time: 10:11 - 10:13 infrastructures PD clearances and super Time: 10:13 - 10:16 cheap credit that Lads foreign companies Time: 10:16 - 10:18 to setup shop there so between 1985 and Time: 10:18 - 10:21 2005 foreign investment P into China at Time: 10:21 - 10:24 nearly 3% of its GDP annually way more Time: 10:24 - 10:28 than Japan ever saw during its boom but Time: 10:28 - 10:31 it's not just foreign cash the Chinese Time: 10:31 - 10:33 government has been throwing support at Time: 10:33 - 10:34 domestic companies too setting up around Time: 10:34 - 10:37 2,000 funds since 2014 to boost Time: 10:37 - 10:39 high-tech Industries it's honestly no Time: 10:39 - 10:41 wonder that China managed to overtake Time: 10:41 - 10:43 the US in manufacturing in just 15 to 20 Time: 10:43 - 10:46 years a process that took us a century Time: 10:46 - 10:49 to pull off against the UK it's Time: 10:49 - 10:51 absolutely wild so we asked this person Time: 10:51 - 10:53 that how exactly did China Reach This Time: 10:53 - 10:55 stage his answer was pretty interesting Time: 10:55 - 10:57 he was like I'm not going to tell you Time: 10:57 - 10:59 you have to experience it yourself he Time: 10:59 - 11:01 said go to this area called hang Bay and Time: 11:01 - 11:03 visit the Hang Bay Museum if you want to Time: 11:03 - 11:06 learn about the history of Time: 11:06 - 11:09 Shenzhen so Hong B by the way is the Time: 11:11 - 11:14 world's largest electronics market and Time: 11:14 - 11:17 the museum that the team visited had the Time: 11:17 - 11:19 entire history of how it and shenen came Time: 11:19 - 11:23 to be what it is today the experience Time: 11:23 - 11:25 inside the museum was mad by the way Time: 11:25 - 11:27 check out some of the visuals it had a Time: 11:27 - 11:29 whole map of chenine with LED lights and Time: 11:29 - 11:32 some of the most Cutting Edge Time: 11:32 - 11:33 Technologies from the past and also Time: 11:33 - 11:35 these cute miniature a robs that were a Time: 11:35 - 11:37 representation of the future but the Time: 11:37 - 11:39 most fascinating thing was shenen story Time: 11:39 - 11:42 let me share you know shenen was Time: 11:42 - 11:43 actually a fishing Village back until Time: 11:43 - 11:45 1979 with a population of just 30,000 Time: 11:45 - 11:49 people but in 1980 it all changed when Time: 11:49 - 11:53 the Chinese government under the Time: 11:53 - 11:55 leadership of dang Xing designated Time: 11:55 - 11:58 shenin as the the country's first Time: 11:58 - 12:00 special economic zone this was actually Time: 12:00 - 12:02 a bold experiment a testing ground for Time: 12:02 - 12:04 economic reforms and opening up to the Time: 12:04 - 12:06 global market this SEC status meant that Time: 12:06 - 12:10 Shenzhen became a magnet for foreign Time: 12:10 - 12:12 investment offering tax incentives and a Time: 12:12 - 12:15 more relaxed regulatory environment Time: 12:15 - 12:17 entrepreneurs and workers from all over Time: 12:17 - 12:20 China flocked to the city bringing with Time: 12:20 - 12:23 them ambition and a willingness to Time: 12:23 - 12:25 innovate the population exploded and Time: 12:25 - 12:27 with that came rap ID Urban Development Time: 12:27 - 12:31 by the 1990s shenzen had established Time: 12:31 - 12:33 itself as a manufacturing Hub producing Time: 12:33 - 12:36 Goods at an unprecedented scale but you Time: 12:36 - 12:38 know rather than resting on its Laurels Time: 12:38 - 12:41 the city continued to evolve the local Time: 12:41 - 12:43 government also invested heavily in Time: 12:43 - 12:46 infrastructure education technology Time: 12:46 - 12:48 laying the groundwork for a shift from Time: 12:48 - 12:50 manufacturing to Innovation fast forward Time: 12:50 - 12:53 to today and Shenzhen is home to some of Time: 12:53 - 12:56 the world's leading Tech giants like Time: 12:56 - 12:58 Huawei tensen and DJI after the museum Time: 12:58 - 13:01 and learning all about shenen history Time: 13:01 - 13:04 the team spent a lot of time speaking to Time: 13:04 - 13:05 the locals and learn so much about the Time: 13:05 - 13:07 culture the cost of living how much they Time: 13:07 - 13:10 spend also what do they think of Time: 13:10 - 13:16 India number one number one number Time: 13:16 - 13:21 one now here's where I also want to bust Time: 13:21 - 13:24 some myths about China and more Time: 13:24 - 13:26 importantly about its people but before Time: 13:26 - 13:28 that I want to show you all the data we Time: 13:28 - 13:29 collected and the quick rundown of the Time: 13:29 - 13:31 cost of living in a city like shenen we Time: 13:31 - 13:33 made a whole chart of all the basic Time: 13:33 - 13:35 expenses that you can look at I'm also Time: 13:35 - 13:37 going to put it in the link now starting Time: 13:37 - 13:39 with rent if you're in shenen renting a Time: 13:39 - 13:41 one-bedroom apartment outside the city Time: 13:41 - 13:43 center which could by the way look like Time: 13:43 - 13:45 this will cost you around 3,500 to 5,1 Time: 13:45 - 13:49 which is roughly 40,000 to 57,500 rupes Time: 13:49 - 13:53 now in the city center this jumps to 7,1 Time: 13:53 - 13:56 to 10,1 or roughly 80,000 to around 1 Time: 13:56 - 14:00 15,000 rupees then there's basic Time: 14:00 - 14:01 necessities like electricity and water Time: 14:01 - 14:03 which is around 300 to 600 W but when it Time: 14:03 - 14:07 comes to Transportation shenen public Time: 14:07 - 14:09 transport is incredibly affordable and Time: 14:09 - 14:11 efficient a monthly pass is around 200 Time: 14:11 - 14:14 to 400 W an occasional meal outside cost Time: 14:14 - 14:17 between 500 to 1,000 W now dining out in Time: 14:17 - 14:20 nice restaurants in chenin is a bit on Time: 14:20 - 14:22 the pricier side but the portions and Time: 14:22 - 14:24 variety were definitely worth it is what Time: 14:24 - 14:27 my team said and finally for Time: 14:27 - 14:29 miscellaneous expenses like Time: 14:29 - 14:30 entertainment and shopping a budget of Time: 14:30 - 14:32 1,000 to 2001 in chenin gives you access Time: 14:32 - 14:35 to some of the best technology Time: 14:35 - 14:37 entertainment and recreational Time: 14:37 - 14:39 activities for a family of four though Time: 14:39 - 14:41 it's approximately 15,000 which is Time: 14:41 - 14:44 around 1.77 lakhs now coming to the Time: 14:44 - 14:48 myths you know sitting here in India we Time: 14:48 - 14:50 all had these thoughts that the Chinese Time: 14:50 - 14:52 might be a bit unfriendly especially Time: 14:52 - 14:54 since China's pretty much cut from the Time: 14:54 - 14:55 entire world but going around the city Time: 14:55 - 14:58 meeting all these vendors going to Time: 14:58 - 15:00 factories talking to so many strangers Time: 15:00 - 15:02 and visiting the place in real life has Time: 15:02 - 15:05 made us realize how hospitable Chinese Time: 15:05 - 15:07 people are also one more thing every Time: 15:07 - 15:10 time you ask them about India they're Time: 15:10 - 15:12 all obsessed with Amir Khan and almost Time: 15:12 - 15:14 every person the team met had watched Time: 15:14 - 15:16 dungle and three idiots and they really Time: 15:16 - 15:18 really loved it so at lunch with this Time: 15:18 - 15:21 potential vendor he mentioned that the Time: 15:21 - 15:23 business ecosystem the entrepreneurs Time: 15:23 - 15:25 especially overall seemed quite happy Time: 15:25 - 15:27 with the government and credited them Time: 15:27 - 15:29 for creating an environment for Time: 15:29 - 15:31 businesses to grow so one of the other Time: 15:31 - 15:33 locals that the team had met there also Time: 15:33 - 15:35 gave an example of this local company Time: 15:35 - 15:36 called zidu which makes these tiny Time: 15:36 - 15:38 electric cars which the government had Time: 15:38 - 15:40 helped he shared how in 2019 this Time: 15:40 - 15:43 company had literally gone bankrupt but Time: 15:43 - 15:45 the government pumped money into it and Time: 15:45 - 15:47 last year brought it back to support the Time: 15:47 - 15:50 EV industry and Entrepreneurship also Time: 15:50 - 15:52 shared how the government is very Time: 15:52 - 15:53 meticulous about making their citizens Time: 15:53 - 15:56 lives better and this was also something Time: 15:56 - 15:57 the team observed and shared said that Time: 15:57 - 15:59 the roads are super clean and almost Time: 15:59 - 16:01 every second Road had this massive Time: 16:01 - 16:03 machine sprinkling water and cleaning Time: 16:03 - 16:05 the roads by the way shenen also has a Time: 16:05 - 16:08 lot of bucks so local shed the shenen is Time: 16:08 - 16:10 actually called the sponge city in China Time: 16:10 - 16:12 and the government has deliberately Time: 16:12 - 16:14 created a lot of parks for a very Time: 16:14 - 16:16 particular reason so spun City we learn Time: 16:16 - 16:19 is a whole Urban concept that the Time: 16:19 - 16:21 Chinese government has brought that's Time: 16:21 - 16:23 designed to act like a sponge literally Time: 16:23 - 16:25 soaking up rainwater instead of letting Time: 16:25 - 16:27 it run off and cause floods so in shenen Time: 16:27 - 16:30 they have done this by creating Time: 16:30 - 16:31 Pavements tons of green spaces and parks Time: 16:31 - 16:35 and design them in such a manner that Time: 16:35 - 16:36 they absorb water and don't let it Time: 16:36 - 16:39 spread to the city and cause any Time: 16:39 - 16:41 problems now one more interesting thing Time: 16:41 - 16:42 that our team observed during this day Time: 16:42 - 16:44 was that they didn't see a single Time: 16:44 - 16:46 homeless person in chenin now that made Time: 16:46 - 16:49 them very curious and then they found Time: 16:49 - 16:50 out that there's more to the story so in Time: 16:50 - 16:52 China there's a thing called huko think Time: 16:52 - 16:54 of it like an internal passport without Time: 16:54 - 16:56 this Urban Huka migrants come can't Time: 16:56 - 16:59 access the same Services as City Time: 16:59 - 17:01 residents and what it has done is it's Time: 17:01 - 17:02 created this invisible divide in their Time: 17:02 - 17:04 society so while yes China is a Time: 17:04 - 17:07 fascinating country but like every Time: 17:07 - 17:08 single country it also has got some Time: 17:08 - 17:10 problems and while the average income of Time: 17:10 - 17:12 even blue CED workers and quality of Time: 17:12 - 17:15 life in China seems elevated like India Time: 17:15 - 17:18 we found that China is also very very Time: 17:18 - 17:20 complex country and to understand it you Time: 17:20 - 17:22 need to actually visit it and spend a Time: 17:22 - 17:25 lot of time there but honestly this trip Time: 17:25 - 17:27 to China actually left us with a lot of Time: 17:27 - 17:29 learnings and we feel like there's so Time: 17:29 - 17:31 much that we can also learn from them Time: 17:31 - 17:33 and take and apply to India as well for Time: 17:33 - 17:35 example the power of good policies Time: 17:35 - 17:38 cannot be overstated China's deliberate Time: 17:38 - 17:40 investment in infrastructure education Time: 17:40 - 17:42 and technology has created a fertile Time: 17:42 - 17:45 ground for Innovation secondly them Time: 17:45 - 17:47 investing in human capital through Time: 17:47 - 17:48 upskilling has really paid off their Time: 17:48 -

17:59 focusing on upskilling here and creating Time: 17:59 - 18:01 a denser pool of skilled people we can Time: 18:01 - 18:03 also harness our vast human resources to Time: 18:03 - 18:06 drive economic growth this essentially Time: 18:06 - 18:08 means enhancing vocational training Time: 18:08 - 18:10 promoting stem education and encouraging Time: 18:10 - 18:12 continuous learning to prepare our Time: 18:12 - 18:14 Workforce for the demands of a rapidly Time: 18:14 -

18:27 India too has made significant strides Time: 18:27 - 18:30 with initiatives like digital India and Time: 18:30 - 18:32 UPI I feel like there's a lot of immense Time: 18:32 - 18:35 potential to further integrate Time: 18:35 - 18:37 technology to improve efficiency Time: 18:37 - 18:39 accessibility and Innovation across all Time: 18:39 - 18:42 the sectors but perhaps the most Time: 18:42 - 18:44 significant takeaway is the importance Time: 18:44 - 18:46 of bold ambition coupled with actionable Time: 18:46 - 18:49 strategies and honestly here's what Time: 18:49 - 18:50 makes me really optimistic about India a Time: 18:50 - 18:53 talent potential is incredible I mean Time: 18:53 - 18:56 we've all seen how Indians can adap ad Time: 18:56 - 18:59 and Excel anywhere in the world now Time: 18:59 - 19:01 imagine if you could create those same Time: 19:01 - 19:03 opportunities right here in our own Time: 19:03 -

      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:10 going to take it? Let's see. Do you have a minute? Mom. Time: 00:10 - 00:20 What is this? So, uh, we had a wild idea for the next AV video. We were thinking Time: 00:20 - 00:30 that they could send you off into the dark web. You know, have you explore it for like 48 hours and show the audience what's out there. Is that even legal? Time: 00:30 - 00:40 It's legal. I mean, I guess as long as you don't do anything illegal, basically. But, like, don't do anything like just don't do illegal What if we this video and influence our audience to go Time: 00:40 - 00:50 to the dark web and they end up in places we don't want them to? Then I don't know. I don't know. These kinds of educational videos, they usually have the opposite effect. So, maybe we could Time: 00:50 - 01:00 take the risk. And uh I don't know. Just I I don't think our audience is dumb enough that they're going to go to the dark web and get themselves into trouble. Okay. I don't mind doing the video, but Time: 01:00 - 01:10 are we sure they won't? Time: 01:10 - 01:20 All right, I want you to try something out, okay? Go to your Google account Time: 01:20 - 01:30 settings and look for the option that lets you monitor your security breaches cuz chances are your information has been leaked somewhere in the dark web. Time: 01:30 - 01:40 And if your data indeed was breached like my information was, then you have to watch this video till the end. You see, for the longest time, I've been very fascinated by the concept of the Time: 01:40 - 01:50 dark web. And by fascinated, I also mean a little bit unsettled because all I have heard is that the most terrible bits of humanity can be found neatly Time: 01:50 - 02:00 organized within the strands of the dark web. Drugs, weapons, human trafficking, God knows what else could be down there. Time: 02:00 - 02:10 We'd been told that it's definitely a place to stay away from and naturally that made all of us all the more curious. So we did our thing, dove deep Time: 02:10 - 02:20 into it and what we learned was that we knew very little about all this. You see the most inaccessible and unexplored territories known to man are space, the Time: 02:20 - 02:30 oceans and also the internet. It is literally so unbelievably vast and filled with so many interesting tidbits. Time: 02:30 - 02:40 And today we're going to take you through all of it from what the internet really is to why this sinister dark web was created in the first place. And Time: 02:40 - 02:50 finally, we are going to go as far into the dark web as we legally can so that you never have to. Time: 02:50 - 03:00 So, when we started to go down the rabbit hole, the very first door was just, \"What the hell is the internet?\" Like, have you guys ever wondered where Time: 03:00 - 03:10 the internet exists or how your floating little phone can somehow send a text message to someone all the way in Japan? It's pretty simple, actually. Stay with me. So, your phone has a Wi-Fi chip in Time: 03:10 - 03:20 it, and its main function is to decode the radio waves coming from the router. The router then connects to a few other devices in your house. Maybe your Time: 03:20 - 03:30 laptop, your smart TV, and even other computers. Together, they form a local area network. Easy stuff, no? But now, this router connects to a modem which Time: 03:30 - 03:40 transmits data through cables or airwaves to your internet service provider. Suddenly, you're part of a regional network with thousands of other computers doing the same thing. Your ISP Time: 03:40 - 03:50 then plugs into something much bigger. That's the national backbone. Just picture massive fiber optic cables stretching across the country carrying Time: 03:50 - 04:00 data at the speed of light. These cables connect every ISP in the country creating a nationwide web of smaller regional networks all talking to each Time: 04:00 - 04:10 other. Zoom out one more time and you'll see that this national network of ISPs rely on submarine cables lying on the ocean floor and satellites orbiting overhead to link globally. They Time: 04:10 - 04:20 basically do so by connecting to global exchange points which are called internet exchange points or IXPS. That's how your phone connects to this global network and lets you send a message to Time: 04:20 - 04:30 someone all the way in Japan. And that's the internet. But you know what's really insane right now as you're watching this? You think you're using the Time: 04:30 - 04:40 entirety of the internet, but you're not. You're using maybe 4% of it. The Google searches, the Instagram scrolling, these YouTube videos, and Time: 04:40 - 04:50 every website you've ever visited, all of it combined barely scratches the surface. This visible part, everything you can access through a search engine Time: 04:50 - 05:00 is called the surface web. It's clean, indexed, and visible. But it's really nothing compared to what lies beneath, which is the deep web. And it makes up Time: 05:00 - 05:10 about 94% of the internet. Now, don't worry. The deep web isn't just some scary criminal underworld. It's just private. Websites that haven't been discovered and indexed Time: 05:10 - 05:20 by crawlers, your emails, your cloud storage, that Google doc you set to private, your Netflix account, even your online banking, they all sit isolated in Time: 05:20 - 05:30 the deep web, fully functional but inaccessible to others. But then there's the dark web. And this is where things get interesting or unsettling. The dark Time: 05:30 - 05:40 web is not really a specific part of the internet that exists somewhere or some place. Rather, it refers to a bunch of websites hosted on various servers Time: 05:40 - 05:50 around the world that you cannot access without following protocol. That's all. So, how do you get access to these sites? You basically need specialized software like the tour browser which Time: 05:50 - 06:00 creates anonymity for you by passing you through layers of encryptions through a process called onion routing. Now this process makes everything very hush- hush Time: 06:00 - 06:10 and untraceable and hence dark. They're not inherently evil. They're just exclusive. And believe it or not, it was created by by the US government. Our goal was to uh create uh more secure Time: 06:10 - 06:20 uh internet communications for uh the government. It's called tour and among other uses Time: 06:20 - 06:30 can help people navigate the so-called dark web which is often used for criminal activity. But it's been revealed that government agencies are still sponsoring it. Eagle criminal Time: 06:30 - 06:40 activity. Imagine this. In the 1990s, researchers at the US Naval Research Lab had a problem. How do you communicate Time: 06:40 - 06:50 sensitive information online when everyone might be watching? So they created to the onion router. The problem was if only government agents used the Time: 06:50 - 07:00 network, it would be obvious who was on it. all sensitive information would stick out like a sortum because that's the only traffic. So by 2002 DARPA the same people who helped create the Time: 07:00 - 07:10 internet made to public. The idea was to get millions of regular people to crowd the same network essentially creating a cover for military personnel. This one Time: 07:10 - 07:20 little decision would go on to create an insane impact in global trade and communication in all sorts of ways. And we are going to cover the good, the bad, and the ugly of the dark web. Time: 07:20 - 07:30 What are you guys doing? Time: 07:30 - 07:40 Okay, let's do it. Let's go to the dark web. Come on. So, what do we need? Time: 07:40 - 07:50 What are you guys doing? We don't need any of this. We just need a laptop and VPN. Time: 08:00 - 08:10 Wait, that's it? Yep. Just one last thing. Time: 08:10 - 08:20 In the last few years, as AI's role in our lives exploded, software development became one of the most impacted professions. It's evolving fast, but one Time: 08:40 - 08:50 thing still slows developers down. That's reviewing code. This is where our partner for today's video, Code Rabbit, comes in. Think of it as your AI powered Time: 08:50 - 09:00 copilot, helping keep your code clean, safe, and precise without slowing you down. With over 10 million pull requests reviewed, Code Rabbit acts like an Time: 09:00 - 09:10 always on senior developer. It integrates seamlessly with GitHub or GitLab, scans every PR, leaves actionable comments, and flags issues before they become problems. It doesn't Time: 09:10 - 09:20 stop there. Code Rabbit also suggests one-click fixes, and supports custom code quality rules using a graph patterns, something that most static analysis tools miss. So, if you're using Time: 09:20 - 09:30 VS Code, Cursor, or Windsurf, Code Rabbit fits right into your workflow. is already trusted by over 1 million repositories including 70,000 Time: 09:30 - 09:40 open-source projects. And for these open-source projects, it is completely free. So, if you want faster, smarter code reviews and cleaner PRs, give Code Time: 09:40 - 09:50 Rabbit a try. I put the link in description. Add Code Rabbit to your workflow and see what the future of coding looks like. Time: 09:50 - 10:00 Okay, this is a list of some cool dark websites. Time: 10:00 - 10:10 There's a lot of political forums on here. People discussing national issues. There's also a lot of memes. Time: 10:10 - 10:20 I wonder get arrested for posting these. Now, despite its sinister reputation, Time: 10:20 - 10:30 the dark web also quietly empowers people fighting against oppression, censorship, and surveillance around the globe. In fact, some of the bravest acts of modern journalism and activism have Time: 10:30 - 10:40 been made possible solely because of the anonymity the dark web provides. Let me take you back to 2010. The Arab Spring is erupting across the Middle East. Time: 10:40 - 10:50 Protesters in Tunisia, Egypt, Syria, they're facing governments that will kill them for speaking out. traditional internet completely monitored, but to Time: 10:50 - 11:00 that gave them a lifeline. Now jump to 2013. Edward Snowden is sitting in Hong Kong hotel room with a bunch of documents that would expose the largest Time: 11:00 - 11:10 surveillance program in human history. How did he safely communicate with journalists without the NSA, his former employer, tracking him down? tour. This Time: 11:10 - 11:20 anonymity has often acted as the backbone for a lot of journalistic intentions. Time: 11:20 - 11:30 So, you don't want people using the dark web because drugs, weapons, whatnot. But Time: 11:40 - 11:50 you also do cuz free speech. Yeah. Irony is the defining trait of the dark web. Just look at to the US government built it for interpersonal communication. Except who uses it? Drug Time: 11:50 - 12:00 cartels, criminal organizations like whistleblowers, journalists and often times these people are using it against the governments that built the thing. Yeah. Time: 12:00 - 12:10 Ironic. Yeah, that's ironic. Yeah. So if you shut it down, you're actually risking destroying all of these legitimate users. Yeah. I mean I mean after all this research it it really feels like the Time: 12:10 - 12:20 dark web as a place is I mean it's not as bad as people have made it out to be Time: 12:20 - 12:30 Jesus Christ. Time: 12:40 - 12:50 Oh It has everything. The anonymity of the dark web protects whistleblowers and dissident from oppression. Yes. But it also Time: 12:50 - 13:00 incidentally protects some truly horrifying stuff. You know, about 57% of dark web content is illegal and most of that are just drugs and weapons and Time: 13:00 - 13:10 whatnot. And the scale of all of it is staggering. Have you ever heard of the Silk Road? It was kind of like Amazon but for all the illegal stuff. It was created in 2011 by a guy who called Time: 13:10 - 13:20 himself Dread Pirate Roberts, but we'll call him by his real name. That's Ross Albert. So, in just 2 years, his site generated around $9.5 million bitcoins Time: 13:20 - 13:30 in sales. That's nearly $200 million made in illegal trade, most of which were from the sale of drugs. Luckily, Time: 13:30 - 13:40 law enforcement wasn't just sitting around watching this happen. The takedown of Silk Road actually reads like a spy thriller. So in mid 2011, the Department of Human Services in Time: 13:40 - 13:50 Baltimore received a tip about the Silk Road. This led to the formation of a multi- agency task force called the Marco Polo, which included the FBI, the DEA, the IRS, and many more. For months, Time: 13:50 - 14:00 these FBI agents poses buyers brandishing large orders in order to map the site's operations. Through this process, they got introduced to all the Time: 14:00 - 14:10 Silk Road admins and that led to the arrest of username Chronic Pain, real name Curtis Green, the site admin. This Time: 14:10 - 14:20 unlocked private communication logs and Bitcoin account records linked to Ross Alrich. After following a trail of breadcrumbs, Ross Alrich was arrested on October 1st, 2013 at a San Francisco Time: 14:20 - 14:30 public library. And get this, okay? He was caught red-handed while logged in as an admin on the Silk Road site and talking to someone he thought was a colleague, but was in fact an undercover Time: 14:30 - 14:40 agent. Fun fact, on 21st January 2025, the second day of Trump's presidency, he pardoned Ross Albert. And the ethics Time: 14:40 - 14:50 behind this decision are quite gray, but that's not part of our story. What is relevant to our story is that busting the Silk Road wasn't the end of dark web Time: 14:50 - 15:00 markets. The damn thing about the internet is that it's like a hydra's head. Shut down one side and three more pop up to take its place. So soon after Silk Road 2.0 came about. Then came all Time: 15:00 - 15:10 sorts of clones and finally the big bad Alphabet market that dwarf Silk Road in scale and Time: 15:10 - 15:20 generated over 1 billion US in sales. Keep in mind these are conservative figures. The real numbers could be way higher. Time: 15:20 - 15:30 But drugs aren't the only thing you'll find there. I'm guessing these are stolen, right? Time: 15:30 - 15:40 Fake IDs, iPhones, hacking services. $500 a week. Time: 15:40 - 15:50 What the? While casually browsing through the dark web, you might come across your personal data. You know Time: 15:50 - 16:00 those massive corporate breaches you hear about, the data that gets stolen there all ends up for sale on the dark web. And it's shockingly cheap. Like someone sold the personal information of Time: 16:00 - 16:10 2.6 million Dolingo users for just $1,500. That's less than a rupee per person. And remember when LinkedIn got hacked in Time: 16:10 - 16:20 2012, Yahoo in 2016? All those passwords ended up in dark web marketplaces in exchange for just peanuts. So what happens to all the stolen data once it Time: 16:20 - 16:30 hits the dark web? Who's buying it really? It gets packaged into something called fulls. That's complete digital profiles containing everything about you. These bundles then get sold to Time: 16:30 - 16:40 cyber criminals who hit you with a barrage of fishing scams like fake job offers and investment opportunities. But the clever ones go for loan fraud. Time: 16:40 - 16:50 Basically, they'll apply for an instant loan using your details. And sure, they need an OTP to greenlight the loan. However, they have a fix for that, too. And it's called a SIM swap scam. All Time: 16:50 - 17:00 they have to do is share your leaked KYC details and get a replacement SIM issued. The moment they activate that new SIM, yours goes dead. Now, every OTP Time: 17:00 - 17:10 that's meant for you flows straight to them. But criminals aren't the only buyers. Political groups also purchase this data for voter profiling and Time: 17:10 - 17:20 targeted misinformation campaigns. In India, with WhatsApp being the largest university with zero admission requirements, manipulating public opinion can often be a byproduct of Time: 17:20 - 17:30 practices within the dark web. And if not political groups, data brokers also feast on these leaks to analyze your consumer behavior patterns and sell those insights to companies who want to Time: 17:30 - 17:40 nudge you toward their products. So maybe take it seriously when they say, \"Hey, it's been 6 months. You should probably change your password.\" Oh, by the way, you can also check if you've Time: 17:40 - 17:50 been compromised at have been porn.com. See, safety measures aren't too hard, but it does take a certain willingness on your part. Okay, so I came across a bunch of Time: 17:50 - 18:00 different mafias. Mexican mafia, Besso Mafia, there's a few onion websites. I couldn't find uh an Indian mafia or a hitman site, but I'm pretty sure that if you looked hard enough, it's going to be Time: 18:00 - 18:10 there. I feel yeah I feel like like 90% of the dark web is probably just like scams. I mean think about it. It's called the dark web. You know people are going to this place expecting like some Time: 18:10 - 18:20 dark And I feel like now that it has this reputation is just filled with a bunch like like really gullible people who are like just getting scammed. Like I found like a bunch of websites where Time: 18:20 - 18:30 they're selling like organs, you know? I mean just think about who needs organs, right? Like there's probably somebody who's super desperate who needs medical help. They put in a ton of money and then at the end of it it's just some Time: 18:30 - 18:40 fake UI. Yeah, they can't even report it cuz technically they'd be incriminating themselves. Yeah, exactly. It gets so much better or worse. I'm not sure. Like I found the cure to cancer by the way. There's like Time: 18:40 - 18:50 websites which are marketing like these offmarket like experimental treatments and one of them is like the cure to cancer. But there are some scams I don't have a huge problem with. There's like Time: 18:50 - 19:00 good scams. What's what's a good scam? Like the Hitman thing he was saying. Uh like basically anybody who signs up for a hitman service is a criminal, right? So, uh I I read that there's like Time: 19:00 - 19:10 ethical hackers who keep track of uh who monitor these hitman databases and then they report their names to the cyber crime division. That's crazy. Okay, check this out. Time: 19:10 - 19:20 There is an important notice from cyber crime department. Your personal credential has been used on dark web continuously. Time: 19:20 - 19:30 If you do not report in us, we will take legal action against you. So basically last night I used my dad's laptop and I went to the dark web. Smart. Time: 19:30 - 19:40 Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. Uh and I I think I was on black hat chat rooms. I was just seeing what people are speaking. What are they talking about? And 15 minutes later they kicked me out. I used to I took an extra layer of VPN Time: 19:40 - 19:50 and still the very next day my dad's gotten this call which I don't know. It's just Oh, still has to be a coincidence. Come on. It doesn't feel like a coincidence. I Time: 19:50 - 20:00 don't know. How do they get this number? Who's who's call? It's just a very odd I mean it's pretty good content for the video. Uh but was it just chat rooms or do you guys do did you find anything Time: 20:00 - 20:10 else? No, there's a bunch of uh things I've come across a bunch of websites that Aina can visit but yeah I got a glimpse of what's coming. Is it is it bad? Time: 20:10 - 20:20 There's no way we can't show this. Time: 20:40 - 20:50 As troubling as stolen data and illicit marketplaces may sound, they pale in comparison to the bottom of the pit. Gore, violence, murders, snuff films, Time: 20:50 - 21:00 and whatn not are spread throughout the dark web. And at its absolute worst, the dark web has become a safe haven for Time: 21:00 - 21:10 human trafficking. To put it bluntly, there are entire forums dedicated solely to buying and selling humans. And the scale of this trade is honestly Time: 21:10 - 21:20 horrifying. According to the International Labor Organization, over 27.6 million people worldwide were found Time: 21:20 - 21:30 to be trapped in forced labor and sex trafficking networks in 2021. And many of these transactions are brokered on dark web platforms. A chilling report by Time: 21:30 - 21:40 Europole found that criminals routinely exploit dark web marketplaces to traffic human beings, often children, because it allows them to await detection with Time: 21:40 - 21:50 devastating efficiency. Yet somehow it gets worse. The dark web hosts extensive networks for child exploitation material operating with terrifying Time: 21:50 - 22:00 sophistication. A 2014 study found that more than 80% of all dark web visits were to child abuse content. This study underscores deeply unsettling patterns Time: 22:00 - 22:10 of human behavior. With the cooperation of 32 countries, including South Korea and the United States, authorities were able to track down those suspected of purchasing child Time: 22:10 - 22:20 pornography using cryptocurrency. In 2019 alone, one of the largest child abuse sites, Welcome to Video, was shut down after authorities discovered more Time: 22:20 - 22:30 than 250,000 disturbing videos. And it gets worse. These videos were accessed and downloaded by over a million anonymous users worldwide. That is sickening. And Time: 22:30 - 22:40 as expected, entering the dark web makes me wonder what kind of up world we're really in. Time: 22:40 - 22:50 Okay, that was predictable. Like we knew this is what we'd find, right? Yeah. But you were the one who said the dark web isn't that bad. I mean there's good and bad both. But I don't see it any worse than the Time: 23:00 - 23:10 actual web or like 4chan or live leak. Yeah. But it's created a huge market for child porn. Yeah. When a market like this exists, it just propagates more of I don't know Time: 23:10 - 23:20 practicing this child exploitation I guess. Exactly. Creating supply which is an increasing demand which is then again increasing the supply. You know, I read about this uh police manual that exists Time: 23:20 - 23:30 and it's basically like a detailed report on how to investigate rape cases. Uh it goes through everything from collecting forensics to identifying suspects. Uh even like victim care. Uh Time: 23:30 - 23:40 guess where it ended up. So what there's like locker rooms and stuff where people are discussing this police manual trying to figure out how to not get caught. I was actually looking into the psychology of visiting the dark web. Time: 23:40 - 23:50 It's surprisingly well documented. Basically people enter the dark web out of curiosity but when they end up there they find a space where the most taboo Time: 23:50 - 24:00 topics are normalized. So it initially really liberates them but eventually it ends up emboldening the user. Emboldening Time: 24:00 - 24:10 and I'm guessing in this context it's uh it just it normalizes your darkest thoughts, intrusive thoughts, impulses which then increases the brain's demand for those thoughts which then increases your brain supply of those thoughts Time: 24:10 - 24:20 which then sends you down a spiral. So the dark web is basically a concept that allows the most evil and the most nastiest of thoughts Time: 24:20 - 24:30 to fester. Okay. But is it good or bad? Like which direction do we take it? Like we need I Time: 24:30 - 24:40 want to figure out what tone do we want to take for the video. Yeah. For the audience when they watch this video, what's the takeaway really? Time: 24:40 - 24:50 The strangest thing about dark web is that it's full of paradoxes. It's like a Time: 24:50 - 25:00 carnival mirror held up to humanity, reflecting our most heroic instincts alongside our darkest impulses, often at the very same time. So, take this as a Time: 25:00 - 25:10 stark warning. The dark web is not a playground for casual curiosity. It's not merely forbidden territory. It's Time: 25:10 - 25:20 dangerous. An exposure to the ecosystem down there can actually alter your psychology. Unless you're a whistleblower or part of a network with journalistic intentions, it is not worth Time: 25:20 - 25:30 going into the dark web. So, please do not try this at home. Time: 25:30 - 25:40People in Dark web don't pretend to be good guys. People in normal internet pretend to be good guys.",

Time: 00:30 - 00:40 And no, I don't blame you. I get it. Your brain, my brain. In fact, everyone's brain is in the midst of a massive rewiring, Time: 00:40 - 00:50 we’ve never seen in human history. It's a pattern that's literally happening across every social platform. Time: 00:50 - 01:00 You know that restless feeling, that itch to check your phone. That inability to stay put. Some call it. Time: 01:00 - 01:10 And let me confess something. I'm making this video because honestly, lately I've been feeling all of it too. The same restlessness, that same short circuit in my inability to read books. Time: 01:10 - 01:20 I'm finding it harder to sit through movies, TV shows, and harder to simply think I am terrified of losing this ability. Time: 01:20 - 01:30 But I can't quit social media because it's my job. So I thought, what better way to study this phenomenon, the history, the future, and why all of it is happening. Time: 01:30 - 01:40 And I also share everything that I learned with all of you guys. Those who stuck till here. Thank you so much. Stick with me for the next 10 minutes because I'll show you exactly Time: 01:40 - 01:50 what's happening inside your head, why it's happening and what we can do about it. It's really important because we feel if we don't understand how our little ancient hardware reacts to modern overload, we risk losing the very capacities, Time: 01:50 - 02:00 that’s focus, creativity, insight that makes us human. Time: 02:00 - 02:10 As you're watching this video, like right now, your brain is being rewired entire time, but you understand exactly what's going on. Time: 02:10 - 02:20 You need to look at how our brains evolved to process information in the first place. We're going back in time. Let me introduce you to the OG human, the hunter gatherer. Time: 02:20 - 02:30 His brain, which is basically very identical to us, evolved over hundreds of thousands of years to do something very specific. That's pay attention to what matters and filter out what doesn't. Time: 02:30 - 02:40 For example, when he sees a predator or sees berries, that's his food. His brain releases dopamine, a chemical that says, hey, this is important. Time: 02:40 - 02:50 Pay attention to this. But fast forward to 2024. You know, we still have that same basic brain architecture. Time: 02:50 - 03:00 But now, instead of the occasional predator that we stumble upon now and then, our brains are continuously being flooded with these same reward chemicals. Not for finding food or avoiding danger. Time: 03:00 - 03:10 But for this, every notification, every like every scroll, each one triggering the same ancient circuitry. You know, our brains can't tell the difference Time: 03:10 - 03:20 between a crucial survival cue and a funny cat video. Both deliver novelty, both release dopamine. The result? A relentless cycle of seeking reward. Time: 03:20 - 03:30 But even meaningless content can feel oddly compelling. Neuroscientists call our brain’s adaptability, neuroplasticity. In simpler times, this slow, careful rewiring took generations. Time: 03:30 - 03:40 But around 2007, coinciding with the smartphone revolution and the rise of social media, this rewiring went into hyperdrive. Time: 03:40 - 03:50 Within a decade and a half, we have trained our brains to crave constant novelty, fragmenting our attention and making deep focus feel unnatural. Time: 03:50 - 04:00 We're facing what scientists call a cognitive evolutionary mismatch. You see our environment change at light speed. While our brains still think we are in the Pleistocene. Time: 04:00 - 04:10 You know, I'm very amused by how stupid yet how smart our little brains are. So in the 1960s, there was this Canadian theorist, Time: 04:10 - 04:20 Marshall McLuhan, who famously said, the medium is the message. He basically argued that form of communication shapes Time: 04:20 - 04:30 society's thinking more than the actual content. And I feel like today, this couldn't be more relevant. You see, before we had TV, radio. But now the media landscape is dominated by platforms Time: 04:30 - 04:40 which are engineered for short bursts of attention. Vertical video feeds, 15 second clips. Trending hashtags. And all of these platforms reward engagement above all else. Time: 04:40 - 04:50 That means more novelty, more shock, more instantaneous gratification. So the message we are receiving isn't just funny dances or cat names. Time: 04:50 - 05:00 The deeper message is that brains should expect immediate rewards at all times. And the medium’s design, endless scrolling, autoplay Time: 05:00 - 05:10 infinite content, conditions are cognitive patterns. We might think that we have control over what we watch, we’re choosing what we watch, but the truth is that the medium chooses how we think. Time: 05:10 - 05:20 And that's what we're sort of being controlled by. We're living in a world where attention is currency, and every swipe is a micro transaction in a massive attention economy. Time: 05:20 - 05:30 So over time, as platforms capitalize on this, more and more, it’ll rewire our neural pathways, making sustained thought more and more difficult. Time: 05:30 - 05:40 And here's another interesting thing I learned while researching about content, media and our brains that I wanted to share with you. So back in 1976, the evolutionary biologist Time: 05:40 - 05:50 Richard Dawkins introduced the concept of “memes” in his book “The Selfish Gene”. If you look at the original meaning of the word “meme”, it meant a unit of cultural transmission spreading from mind to mind. Time: 05:50 - 06:00 How genes spread biologically. But decades later, internet has turned “meme” into a household word describing funny images, jokes and viral trends that replicate endlessly online. Time: 06:00 - 06:10 But let's actually pause for a moment and think about what “memes” represent tiny packets of information that spread at the speed of light. Time: 06:10 - 06:20 Means today are often low context, high on emotional punch. They are cultural shorthand, intellectual popcorn transmitted in seconds. Time: 06:20 - 06:30 And you know, Gen Z and Gen Alpha have entire vocabularies born not from books or lived experiences, but from memes and viral references. Time: 06:30 - 06:40 “Shawty”, “blud”, like, that's good, that's rizz. It's rizz right there. Mad lit, on God on God, no cap. Skibidi Toilet, Gyatt, Ohio, Fanum Tax, Rizz. Time: 06:40 - 06:50 This is literally how teenagers are talking right now. You know, there are random songs that are going viral on the internet. Slangs like “moye-moye”. These micro cultural phenomena, they spread Time: 06:50 - 07:00 instantly umoored from geography, history or depth. And if you think about it, it's not just the audience. Even brands are adapting to this shift to look more relatable to the audience. Time: 07:00 - 07:10 Welcome to the Goated Ganga Gurukulam. We have got the squad, the energy, Time: 07:10 - 07:20 we are the OG. The drip check on the point. Tech level, low key top tier hit different. I feel like Dawkins’ idea of a “meme” as a cultural Time: 07:20 - 07:30 replicator, has actually become supercharged in the digital age. Memes now are shaping our worldview are inside jokes are language, Time: 07:30 - 07:40 the way we talk, our values, without us ever slowing down to reflect. Yes, they're fun, they're fast, and they reinforce a new neural wiring that's quick hits of amusement, then on to the next thing. Time: 07:40 - 07:50 You know, if you look at the repercussion of all of it on the younger generations, Gen Z and Gen Alpha, the result is unprecedented. Time: 07:50 - 08:00 Teachers say their students struggle to focus on a single lesson. Kids were born into this era of iPads and iPhones at the age 2, have neural pathways shaped by infinite feeds from day one. Time: 08:00 - 08:10 Studies show declining reading rates, reduced tolerance for slower media like long form journalism, documentary films, Time: 08:10 - 08:20 and an impatience with anything that isn't immediately stimulating. And it's all quite concerning, because as we change our neural architecture, our neural pathways, mental health professionals have noticed Time: 08:20 - 08:30 increases in anxiety, restlessness and the inability to handle boredom. You know, boredom, once the crucible of creative thought Time: 08:30 - 08:40 is now treated like it's a disease. Why sit and daydream when we can instantly check social media? Why reflect upon anything in the world when social algorithms promise something entertaining right now? Time: 08:40 - 08:50 This is essentially what we are calling brain rot, the Oxford Dictionary word of the year, is this profound shift on how we process information. Time: 08:50 - 09:00 Instead of building deep conceptual understanding of anything, we skip along the surface of data streams. Instead of remembering what we saw, Time: 09:00 - 09:10 we rely on the internet as an external hard drive. Instead of forming stable dopamine baselines where normal activities can also be satisfying, Time: 09:10 - 09:20 we are perpetually chasing micro doses of digital dopamine. And to be honest, there is another side to this, another side that we can pick. You know, instead of mindlessly scrolling, what if we use the internet Time: 09:20 - 09:30 to learn something genuinely valuable? Now, I know it's also easy to blame the platform for a distraction, but we need to remember that it's also a very powerful enabler. Time: 09:30 - 09:40 Without it, some of the biggest companies in the world wouldn't exist. And even me, I own much of my career to the internet learning skills outside traditional college, connecting with people and building businesses. Time: 09:40 - 09:50 All of it happened online. In this hyper competitive world, the right content, right resources, can also help you stand out. Time: 09:50 - 10:00 With just a few clicks, you can learn almost anything, sharpen your abilities, and gain real leverage. Of course, navigating this crowded digital landscape isn't always easy. Time: 10:00 - 10:10 That's why we want to guide you towards something truly worthwhile. If you are a developer or aspiring to become one, IBM Skills Build has amazing online courses designed just for you. Time: 10:10 - 10:20 With expert led training and flexible learning options, IBM Skills Build provides practical, real world skills that top employers are looking for. Time: 10:20 - 10:30 One such course that I found to be interesting is build your first Chat bot. In this course you learn the steps to create conversational chatbots that can understand and respond to natural language. Time: 10:30 - 10:40 You dive into the fundamentals of Natural Language Processing, or NLP and discover how to apply them to real world scenarios. By the end of it, you will be able to build a chat bot that offers options and suggestions Time: 10:40 - 10:50 using both pre-built and custom conversations to generate engaging dialog. And I'll tell you the best part you can access the course for absolutely Time: 10:50 - 11:00 free on IBM Skills Build platform, and you don't have to spend days on it. All it takes is just one hour of your time. Be sure to enroll, complete the course, Time: 11:00 - 11:10 and share your digital stickers online with the hashtag IBM skills. But if you are interested and want to check out the course, I'm putting a link in the description below, now back to the video. Time: 11:10 - 11:20 I have a question for you. Have you ever thought about how our memories form? You know our brain, it basically forms memories through repeated attention. Time: 11:20 - 11:30 Now, of course, this is a little more simplified, but when we focus deeply, the hippocampus consolidates new information into long term storage. Time: 11:30 - 11:40 But here's another thought for you. What if we never concentrate long enough? What if every 30 seconds we interrupt ourselves with a notification? Our brain never gets the chance to encode a memory. Time: 11:40 - 11:50 The result? Just in time memory, where we trust Google or social feeds to provide answers on demand. The brain literally just goes like Time: 11:50 - 12:00 why store any knowledge when it's all just a click away? Dopamine, again, our favorite neurotransmitter, is at the heart of this. Each swipe, each tap or click can trigger a small dopamine release. Time: 12:00 - 12:10 Reinforcing this habit. It’s basically like a slot machine. Maybe the next pull will deliver something amazing. And this intermittent reinforcement is highly addictive. Time: 12:10 - 12:20 Training us for shallowness. Neuroscientist Nicholas Carr once warned in his book “The Shallows” that the internet changes not only what we think about, but how we think. Time: 12:20 - 12:30 And honestly, today that warning feels like. The attention economy, companies monetizing every second of your gaze., has economic implication as well. Time: 12:30 - 12:40 You know, productivity suffers when we can't sustain focus, creativity declines when we never let our minds wander. And if you think about the second order effect of all of this, countries itself Time: 12:40 - 12:50 depend on citizens who can grapple with complex issues, think critically and consider multiple viewpoints. But how will we do all of it if we are trained to consume content in tiny, disjointed snippets? Time: 12:50 - 13:00 You know, as we become more distractible, we risk losing our competitive advantage. True innovation emerges from deep work, from extended periods Time: 13:00 - 13:10 of uninterrupted thought. And if we can't tolerate silence or complexity, you might struggle to solve any big problems when there's so much to solve. All of the problems that we face right now globally, they all require Time: 13:10 - 13:20 sustained attention, not a flurry of half read headlines. So the question is, what do we do? Are we doomed to become shallow, restless scrollers. Time: 13:20 - 13:30 Well, there's some good news. You know, neuroplasticity actually works both ways. Just how we adapted to this high dopamine environment. Time: 13:30 - 13:40 We can also adapt to the alternative. We can retrain our brains. But of course, it's not going to be easy. It's going to be like building muscle after years of being a couch potato. Time: 13:40 - 13:50 It takes a lot of intentional effort, and I think the very first step is just recognizing the problem and having awareness and some intentionality towards fixing it. Time: 13:50 - 14:00 I'll tell you some things that I've been trying that have work for me. First is essentially just admitting that this is something I need to fix. Second is progressive overload for attention. If you’ve trained your brain to watch 15 second reels every day, Time: 14:00 - 14:10 don't expect to read a heavy 500 page book right away. Start small, 5 minutes of focus reading, then 10, then 20. Time: 14:10 - 14:20 Over time you will build mental endurance. Your concentration muscles strengthens with incremental challenges. Second is environmental design, which has really, really helped me. Time: 14:20 - 14:30 You know, our environment nudges our behavior. So if your phone is always on your desk, you will grab it. If you put it in another room when you're working or when you're studying. Time: 14:30 - 14:40 If you use website blockers, or add a lot of friction to access infinite content, that could work for you. Basically, what we have to do is make focus the path of least resistance, Time: 14:40 - 14:50 but make distraction a path with a lot of resistance. Next is just rebalancing the dopamine little bit. You know, I've started setting aside periods, maybe 30 minutes in a day or maybe two. Time: 14:50 - 15:00 Not in a day where I just sit and literally do nothing stimulating. No phone, no TV, no podcast, no YouTube, nothing. Time: 15:00 - 15:10 But I feel like if you push through your brain somewhere, resets this dopamine baseline. After a few weeks, reading a book or just having a slow conversation can feel rewarding again. And this isn't pseudo science. Time: 15:10 - 15:20 Neuroscientists have confirmed that reducing stimulus overload can restore your capacity for deep focus. And lastly, it's just mindful consumption. Time: 15:20 - 15:30 Next time you watch a video or read an article, reflect afterward. What did I learn? How does it connect to what I know? I think a lot of schools and institutions also need to start thinking about this problem. Time: 15:30 - 15:40 Something that schools might need to start teaching is attention literacy. Addressing the problem with students. Employers could incentivize deep work over constant slack pings. Time: 15:40 - 15:50 I feel like platforms also somewhere should start considering more humane design principles, less infinite scroll, and concentrated more towards conscious pausing. Time: 15:50 - 16:00 And as consumers, we can definitely demand better interfaces that respect our cognitive limits. So if there's somebody who has stuck with me till here, you are part of the 15%. Time: 16:00 - 16:10 You've demonstrated that with intention and interest, we can resist the pull of endless novelty. I would like to leave you guys with a few closing thoughts. Remember, 100,000 years ago, our ancestors Time: 16:10 - 16:20 learned to pay attention selectively for survival. But today, survival might depend on relearning how to pay attention deeply. Time: 16:20 - 16:30 We don't have to reject technology. But you must insist that things that makes us human focus, memory, creativity are worth protecting. So after this video ends, try not to click away immediately. Time: 16:30 - 16:40 Sit quietly for a minute. Let the information settle. Ask yourself, what resonated with me? What can I do differently tomorrow? Time: 16:40 - 16:50 I feel like this small act of intentional reflection fights brain rot. It reclaims a piece of your neural real estate from the infinite scroll. And lastly, I have a small request from all of you. Time: 16:50 - 17:00 If you are somebody who has gone through this and fought this and are taking intentional action, or if you’ve found some things that have worked for you, please, please, Time: 17:00 - 17:10 please do share them in the comments below. I would love to read it. I feel like it will also be valuable for all the other people who are watching this video. Time: 17:10 - 17:20 Yeah, that's about it. My name is Achina Mayya. Thank you so much for watching. Please don't forget to hit the subscribe button and please share this video with your friends and family, if you found it valuable. Time: 17:20 - 17:30I feel like shit after watching shorts/reels",

In this way it would have taken some more months to totally\nunderstand what’s happening. Then more and more to train myself to get\ncontrol over my brain.\nI don’t use insta, or any short videos. No to digital devices after 8pm and\nmany more. But it was not totally helpful\nBut\nThanks to u that u made it so simple and save a lot of time in\nunderstanding.\nIt’s time to save ourselves from this digital era as they keep finding new\nways to control our brain.\nThis is surprising that reducing stimulus overload restores brain capacity for\ndeep focus\nThanks a lot achinamayya and aevy tv for ur amazing content\nI feel happy now and dopamine……. 😂",

      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:10 [Music] McDonald's last year a sweet shop with Time: 00:20 - 00:30 humble beginnings from bcon Aire reached a 20,000 CR valuation The Story begins at a time where young Shri ganga bishan Agarwal fondly known as halam B's mother Time: 00:30 - 00:40 joined his father in helping him make and sell buia as a young boy he had observed his aunt's buia recipe where Time: 00:40 - 00:50 she would use Moi Dal instead of bason halam adopted the same recipe and focused on making buia finer and crisper Time: 00:50 - 01:00 he went on to start a small shop in bcon a in 1937 he also added his own twist by adding a particular type of lentil known as mki as his shop and buja became Time: 01:00 - 01:10 popular he started selling it at a price of 5 rupees a kg as opposed to his father who sold it at the price of 2 PES Time: 01:10 - 01:20 per kg he parted ways with his father and grandfather's business eventually and gave a brand to his buia by calling it dungar safe named after a ruler of Time: 01:20 - 01:30 bikanir Maharaja dungar Singh now dungar Singh was not only a ruler he was also one of the most famous and influential people that banire knew by naming it Time: 01:30 - 01:40 dungar sa he borrowed some of that trust and some of that influence that that name commanded a smart marketing move by a person who would build one of the Time: 01:40 - 01:50 largest brands in the country [Music] Time: 01:50 - 02:00 about a decade later the buia or dunger saved was so popular that his shop would Time: 02:00 - 02:10 sell 200 kgs of it every single week the price had also gone up from the original 2 PES per kg to 25 PES per kg now one Time: 02:10 - 02:20 incident I want to bring your attention to is that in the 1950s halam and his wife were once visiting Kolkata for a wedding when he got the idea of starting Time: 02:20 - 02:30 a shop there while most people go to a wedding to enjoy entrepreneurs go there for expansion in 1957 halam along with his two sons mulchand and rameshwar Lal Time: 02:30 - 02:40 set up a shop called halam bujaa in Kolkata the shop became a success in a few years now over the next three Time: 02:40 - 02:50 decades the grandsons of halam expanded their business shiv kishan Agarwal took the business to nagpur manohar and madhusudan agal took the business to Time: 02:50 - 03:00 Delhi he Branch now one thing about Time: 03:00 - 03:10 Delhi was that Delhi was a fierce competitive playing Ground buia was not a unique product there and they had to focus on innovating the product and the Time: 03:10 - 03:20 flavors to keep up with the competition however by 1983 shiv kishan had also expanded his business to Delhi with the help of his brother Time: 03:20 - 03:30 they had set up a house and a factory a few stories above a sick Baker shop in Chi chalk during the 1984 riots the baker shop and the house and Factory of Time: 03:30 - 03:40 the Agarwal brothers were burnt down and destroyed the brother decided to build the business from the ground up and give it a brand new start very soon the Time: 03:40 - 03:50 business picked up and they turned their apartment into a factory trying to keep up with the demand this is one of the advantages of building a brand even if Time: 03:50 - 04:00 you fall to the ground it's very easy for you to come back up now the single location was not enough and they set up their first factory in the late 80s now Time: 04:00 - 04:10 one issue that has been plaguing the hyams brand for a very long time was family disputes halam had put territorial division the northern part Time: 04:10 - 04:20 was served by halam snacks and ethnic foods halam Foods International served the western and southern part of the country and the Kolkata based halam buja Time: 04:20 - 04:30 served the eastern part when the Kolkata base business and family tried to enter the Delhi region they refused to alter their brand name and as a result the Time: 04:30 - 04:40 grandsons of halam got involved in a dispute over trademarks and brand Time: 04:40 - 04:50 ownership hey who hey [Music] Time: 04:50 - 05:00 [Music] Time: 05:00 - 05:10 by the '90s they had started exporting Time: 05:10 - 05:20 their products to different countries despite the fighting however the brand continued to grow now imagine this for the customer right it would be so confusing to see two companies with the Time: 05:20 - 05:30 exact same names who do you buy from who do you have allegiance to are they the same company now to avoid all of that the case went to court and it went on for 15 years finally in 2013 the court Time: 05:30 - 05:40 made Delhi based halam the sole owner of halam buja Wala now over the years the grandsons of halam expanded the business Time: 05:40 - 05:50 to multiple parts of India and eventually took it abroad and started stocking up in different parts of the world America and Time: 05:50 - 06:00 mbaa in the financial year 2013 to 2014 Ham's revenues crossed Time: 06:00 - 06:10 3,500 cror more than the combined revenue of dominoes and McDonald's in India in the same Financial year in 2017 Time: 06:10 - 06:20 hams became India's largest snack company surpassing PepsiCo in sales and the award for the highest revenue Time: 06:20 - 06:30 generated this year goes to Time: 06:30 - 06:40 ham halam brought in more than a billion dollar in Revenue now a lot of you might Time: 06:40 - 06:50 be wondering what is their secret sauce why did they win the first thing is that they really focused on shelf life today they use nitrogen filled pouches for up Time: 06:50 - 07:00 to 6 months of shelf life and even use the tagline 6 months on the shelf and 6 seconds in your mouth second thing is that they realize that numen is an Impulse buy for people if you want to Time: 07:00 - 07:10 package numen well then you need to do so with very colorful packaging to attract that impulse by and this brings me to my next point which is that Ham's Time: 07:10 - 07:20 brand stood not just for trust but also for celebration whenever somebody's in a celebratory mood they tend to end up spending more money and this is Time: 07:20 - 07:30 something that the alcohol brands have realized for a very long time but hams took a very different approach to the same thing finally they had deep offline distribution networks they had Time: 07:30 - 07:40 relationships with Distributors they had relationships even with individual stores in the beginning and these relationships while it can't be Quantified as a large number was very Time: 07:40 - 07:50 easy for them to put their product into the hands of the people where they went the most finally and this is a approach that halam took that is the complete opposite of Red Bull was that they had Time: 07:50 - 08:00 full control of manufacturing and the ability to cost control whenever hyams felt that there was something that was too expensive they would bring down the cost themselves because they had full Time: 08:00 - 08:10 control of the [Music] process just a te joined his family Time: 08:10 - 08:20 business thee [Music] Time: 08:20 - 08:30 in front [Music] Time: 08:30 - 08:40 ofers EMP we be selling SS yeah Time: 08:40 - 08:50 Empire we be selling Time: 08:50 - 09:00Brother the quality you guys are coming up with in each and every video, It's more than amazing.

      "transcript": "Time: 00:10 - 00:20 So it all started when a tweet went viral recently about India v/sAmerica price parity. A lot of people were saying that, you know, getting a 30 lakh salary in India Time: 00:20 - 00:30 is equivalent to getting $120k, which is roughly about a crore in America. Another person posted this. People who were living in America got angry Time: 00:30 - 00:40 and were like, you cannot put a price on fresh air. Honestly, it's been a decade long heated debate and I started questioning, are these figures true? Time: 00:40 - 00:50 How much does it actually cost to live in America? How much really is $100k worth in the US? How much is that worth in India? Is it ₹30 lakhs? Is it ₹40 lakhs? Or is it ₹80 lakhs? Time: 00:50 - 01:00 What would the equivalent lifestyle be? So to get an accurate answer. I decided to make a video. I traveled to the top American cities last month Time: 01:00 - 01:10 and found the answer myself. In this video, I've created comparisons that provide the one video you need to answer your questions about price parity in America. With examples by the way. I went there. Time: 01:10 - 01:20 I am a testament to this. And I'll also show you what America, San Francisco, New York was like. Let's begin. Time: 01:20 - 01:30 We start with the basics first. Let me explain something called Purchasing Power Parity. So Purchasing Power Parity or “PPP” is simply the ratio of the price of a basket of goods at one location, divided Time: 01:30 - 01:40 by the price of the basket of goods at a different location. But why is it important? You see, prices of goods and services differ between countries, Time: 01:40 - 01:50 and it can be difficult to compare how much your money will buy in different places. Let me give you an example. $3 can get you one can of soda in America, but three cans in India. Time: 01:50 - 02:00 And this is where “PPP” or Purchasing Power Parity comes in. It basically lets us compare the real value of money between different countries, and also helps us adjust GDP to show how an economy is doing. Time: 02:00 - 02:10 Now, you know, every time it comes to this U.S. versus India comparison, people will say that PPP is too simplistic. It doesn't take into account a lot of things, Time: 02:10 - 02:20 which is also a fair argument, because your basket of goods or spending habits may not be similar to other person's basket of goods. For example, if you're a fresher, your needs would be very different Time: 02:20 - 02:30 from a family of four who will probably need car, schooling for their children, etc. Based on the current calculation, though the OECD says that $100k is ₹23 lakhs in India. Time: 02:30 - 02:40 The world Bank says it's ₹21 lakhs. But if you stick with me till the end, I'll tell you what I learned from my experience. So from the very moment I stepped in American soil, Time: 02:40 - 02:50 I started doing my research. The very first person we met was a driver sent by Google, who came to pick us up in San Francisco. Time: 02:50 - 03:00 He was from Brazil, had moved to America to work, and he was just the right candidate because guess what? He was making $100,000 a year. Time: 03:00 - 03:10 Yes. Let that sink in. A driver making $100,000. That's basically 84 lakhs. Honestly, I thought he was lying. But over ten days, I asked, “How much do you make?” to every single driver, Time: 03:10 - 03:20 every person I met across San Francisco, L.A., New York. And all the drivers we met were making 7-8 thousand dollars per month. Time: 03:20 - 03:30 Yep! It blew my mind too. It also made me question, does everybody starting out in America make like $100,000? Is it more like making Time: 03:30 - 03:40 5 LPA salary in India? Because drivers back home make that much? Also, does it mean that all our friends in US getting a one crore package are actually just making entry level salaries? Time: 03:40 - 03:50 So it's obviously a little more nuanced than that. But before we talk about that, I want to quickly thank our partner for this video, Odoo. Odoo is an enterprise resource management planning software, which you can use to manage Time: 03:50 - 04:00 all your business needs like sales, accounting and CRM. Now, if you are looking to streamline your operations and stay on top of the tasks, Odoo’s open Source project management Time: 04:00 - 04:10 tool is just what you need. You can organize your task using different views like. Visualize your workflow with Kanban, that shows all the tasks as cards with main info at front. Or get a bird's eye view of your project timeline Time: 04:10 - 04:20 with Gantt chart to spot potential roadblock and spot key metrics, or a list view to simplify or make batch changes. You can easily schedule activities, Time: 04:20 - 04:30 add all the info as log notes, see the emails and conversations with clients or team at the chatter, put hours worked in the timesheet, and much more. And you know the best part? All of this is for free Time: 04:30 - 04:40 since Odoo’s first app is free for life with unlimited support and hosting. So check out Odoo from the link in description below. Now back to the video. Time: 04:40 - 04:50 This was my very first candidate, so I was also a little apprehensive of recording him because I didn't want him to get angry. But I also casually asked him, so how do you spend your $100,000? Time: 04:50 - 05:00 That's a lot of money, you must be saving a lot, right? He was like, “No, $100,000 is nothing in San Francisco, you know” “I live an hour north of San Francisco and I pay like, $3,000 rent.” Time: 05:00 - 05:10 “I've got a kid, so it's kind of tough.” This specific day will be a rent of $3,000. Living an hour away north of San Francisco. Time: 05:10 - 05:20 $3,000 is ₹2.5 lakhs. He mentioned it was impossible to find a home for his family of three, even an hour north of San Francisco, for less than $3,000. Time: 05:20 - 05:30 That is quite a lot, right? Was he sure about this? I opened Craigslist right away to check the rent. $3,000 for a one bedroom. That sounds insane. Time: 05:30 - 05:40 Now, I also realize the Bay area is actually made up of small pockets of different- different areas. So there's Palo Alto, there's Woodside, Atherton, Menlo Park, where a lot of rich founders stay. Time: 05:40 - 05:50 but then there are also the cheaper areas. And I'll tell you what, the cheaper areas also cost $2,000 minimum for a one bedroom apartment. This is Silicon Valley, by the way. Time: 05:50 - 06:00 Wait till you guys see New York. So this was Sandeep, another driver we spoke to in New York, Varun-”Including all of that?” Sandeep-”5000 plus.” And he was also telling us how his monthly expenses were $4,000 per month. Time: 06:00 - 06:10 That's around ₹3.3 lakh. So he didn't actually stay in the city. He stayed outside of the main city. And he said with gas, insurance, everything included, Time: 06:10 - 06:20 his expenses were $65,000 a year. That is ₹54 lakhs. That's just mind boggling. By the way, I also want to show you guys my room Time: 06:20 - 06:30 that we got in New York. There was literally no space for me and Varun to walk and cross each other at the same time. But I'll tell you what, that's not surprising part. Take a wild guess how much this shoe-box costed us. Time: 06:30 - 06:40 ₹10,000? ₹15,000? Nope! It was ₹30,000 per night. This is also when I realized that, you know, even if I pay $2000 or $3000 Time: 06:40 - 06:50 to get a 1 BHK apartment here, there's a significant difference in a 1 BHK here, versus back home. Basically in India, a 1 BHK Time: 06:50 - 07:00 is more like 700-800ft². That's probably something as big as this. But in America it could also mean like 200-300ft², which is probably something like this. Time: 07:00 - 07:10 Especially in the big cities. Essentially, what I realized was that the price per square feet rental in America is much, much higher. Now there is some good news. You don't need to be living Time: 07:10 - 07:20 in the big cities, downtown. You can also probably go stay an hour away and commute to work, or stay in smaller towns, where you can get mansions as big as this. But then, you know, you could also go missing out Time: 07:20 - 07:30 on networking opportunities, events like these. Or just really experiencing America like the movies and TV shows we've grown up watching shows us. And I also found out some scary details that I'll tell you right Time: 07:30 - 07:40 after we cover all the good stuff, that's the American food and the American cars. Time: 07:40 - 07:50 Aren't you hungry? This is pretty good. You’ve gotta be loosing money on this. America’s pizzas, America's burgers, all taste really, really great. Time: 07:50 - 08:00 Now, let me show you how much they actually cost. So this is my very first meal, it was two burgers, two fries, two drinks, and one tiny avocado, which cost us $46. Time: 08:00 - 08:10 That's close to ₹3,800. In fact, every meal we had after this, was a minimum of $30 for two people going up to $60-$70 in nicer places. Time: 08:10 - 08:20 Now, I want to show you something odd. I want you to observe this bill and notice an anomaly. Did you spot it? No? Can you see this $5 tip on the bill? Time: 08:20 - 08:30 $5, that's nearly ₹417. Now, did you know? That in America, tipping is not just expected, but it's practically mandatory. Time: 08:30 - 08:40 I literally couldn't wrap my head around this. So every meal that you eat out will actually cost you an extra 10-15%. Thanks to this peculiar gratuity culture that they have. Time: 08:40 - 08:50 Dora. Doru! *UwU* Come here. Sit. Time: 08:50 - 09:00 Good girl. *^_^* And I’ll tell you what, it gets weirder. Because even self-service kiosks demand tips at checkout. Which is strange, because what exactly are you tipping for when it's self-service? Time: 09:00 - 09:10 Because there is no service there. You are doing all the work. I ask “Have you lost your rabid ass minds?” And you know what? If anybody's around and they see that you're not tipping them, they'll actually get mad at you. Time: 09:10 - 09:20 Now, I realize the whole issue is that the FNB industry in America, they don't pay the helpers and waiters well. Most of these helpers are paid minimum wages. So a lot of these folks Time: 09:20 - 09:30 make most of the money from tips. By the way, a New York local was telling me that if you don't dip them, the waiters will literally record a video of you and put it on TikTok, or put it online saying that “Look at this terrible customer who only paid us like a 5% tip.” Time: 09:30 - 09:40 Delivery Man-“I just want to say the nice house for a $5 tip.” Lady-”You're welcome.” Delivery Man-”F*ck You.” Now let's talk about roads. Time: 09:40 - 09:50 I- Love- Roads! I know it’s a strange thing to say. But, I love studying roads, I love urban infra, Time: 09:50 - 10:00 and I love how good roads have a multiplier effect on the economy. Highways of the future. We have to have these roads to meet the economic growth. The population shifts. Time: 10:00 - 10:10 In fact, I’ve done a whole video about this. You can check it out here. So I basically really enjoyed American Roads. It was my favorite part about the whole trip. We in fact did a road trip driving all the way from San Francisco Time: 10:10 - 10:20 to Los Angeles. And you know, while you're driving, on one side you've got the ocean and the other side you've got the grasslands. I'm not going to lie, it literally feels like a scene right out of a movie. Time: 10:20 - 10:30 Also, the lane discipline was very interesting to observe because for somebody who loves things being super organized, this was a treat to the eyes. Now, what does it cost to experience these amazing roads? Time: 10:30 - 10:40 Well, we paid around $700 for this car for three days. The public transport system kind of sucks in California. It's not like New York, where you have subways. So we had to rely on Ubers, Time: 10:40 - 10:50 until we got a car of our own. You can check some of my bills out. Take a closer look. Because Uber is really, really expensive in America. It also kind of makes sense why Uber drivers make so much money here. Time: 10:50 - 11:00 Because for even the tiniest of distances, you're literally paying $20-$30, which is close to ₹2000-₹3000. By the way, cars are much cheaper in America than in India. Time: 11:00 - 11:10 Check these out. These are some old cars that you can get for ₹8-₹9 lakhs and ₹16 lakhs, and they look So- Damn- Good! By the way, talking about commute, Time: 11:10 - 11:20 I cannot not show you guys this. So we took a driverless cab, Waymo, in San Francisco. AI-”This experience may feel futuristic.” And I've literally never experienced Time: 11:20 - 11:30 anything like this. I was honestly kind of confused whether to marvel at how far technology has come or be scared. So it comes, you open it, sit, put a code, Time: 11:30 - 11:40 and it starts driving to the destination. You think we'll ever get this in India? Let me know in the comments. Anyway! Time: 11:40 - 11:50 Remember I told you I found out some pretty disturbing details about San Francisco? While we were in this Waymo. I was watching some videos about this self-driving Waymo cab on my phone, okay? And I stumbled upon this one video Time: 11:50 - 12:00 of a Waymo burning! Now while I was in San Francisco, I would often see these signs saying, don't leave things in your car or people will break it open. So I got curious, like, what is going on? Time: 12:00 - 12:10 I didn't know how bad it was. Did you know? that vandalism, breaking into cars, burning down cabs, Time: 12:10 - 12:20 it's actually pretty common in San Francisco. 20,550 car break ins last year in SF That's almost 59 car Break-Ins every single day. Time: 12:20 - 12:30 I was questioning some locals about this, and they told me about this very interesting law in California, which is called prop 47. This law basically says that theft of property Time: 12:30 - 12:40 with the value of less than $950 is considered petty theft and called a misdemeanor. It's not a felony. So you can literally just break open cars, Time: 12:40 - 12:50 make sure that the theft is under $950 and walk away. Even the cops were like, the people know the law, one of the first things they ask us is, “Can I just get a ticket and be on my way?” Time: 12:50 - 13:00 if they get caught. This is wild. But then I saw it happen right in front of my eyes at target. So there were these two men who looked absolute normal. Okay. They walked in. Time: 13:00 - 13:10 picked up a bunch of things and walked off. And not a single person stopped them. So I was like, what is going on? Why is nobody stopping these people? And the person at target told me, Time: 13:10 - 13:20 you are not allowed to touch people or you can be charged for assault. So you just have to let these people walk away. I was like, what? You know, they also cannot put people in jail for petty crime because the cost of locking up someone in California is around $132,000. Time: 13:20 - 13:30 So locking up a California state prison for one year cost nearly twice as much as tuition at the state's top private universities. Time: 13:30 - 13:40 In fact, even New York loses $4.4 billion to theft every year. If you are a store owner in America, you're basically screwed. You know, every time the argument of purchasing power parity Time: 13:40 - 13:50 comes up, people start arguing. Saying that you can't put a cost on fresh air. And I agree, you can't. But you also cannot put a cost on all of this. You cannot put a cost on safety. Time: 13:50 - 14:00 You cannot put a cost on the whole fentanyl crisis that's going on in Silicon Valley, and people who become addicted to substances because there's so readily available and no one's going to stop you from taking it. Time: 14:00 - 14:10 There are literally so many homeless people in San Francisco, and no, they are not like the homeless people you see in India. These people look normal. Time: 14:10 - 14:20 They're dressed normal. Except they're on all sorts of drugs. Look at this video, okay. This is a random homeless person on the street casually talking to herself. Time: 14:20 - 14:30 And on this very same day, by the way, something very scary happened. So I wanted to get coffee, and I didn't know that literally nothing, nothing is open on a Sunday in San Francisco. Time: 14:30 - 14:40 So the only place that was open was Starbucks, which was like 15 minutes away. So I walked in and it was very, very crowded, okay. Now, while I was standing in the row, there was a person Time: 14:40 - 14:50 standing right behind me, and he started whispering something in my ear. So I suddenly turned around. I was like, what's up? And he looks at me and he goes like, “Hey- -do you have a dollar?’ “Can you buy me a coffee? please?” Time: 14:50 - 15:00 “I'm hungry and I have no money.’ That is when I stopped and I looked around the whole Starbucks and I realized that most of the people there, they were not customers waiting to buy coffee from Starbucks. Time: 15:00 - 15:10 They were all homeless people who were standing there inside Starbucks because it was too cold to be outside, and this was the only place open on a Sunday, so they were actually inside for shelter. This was very-very eerie. Time: 15:10 - 15:20 So I literally just ran because think about it, they won’t be charged anything if they take less than $950 from me because it's not a felony. Right? Now New York, L. A., Palo Alto, Mountain View, Time: 15:20 - 15:30 a lot of the other areas in Silicon Valley were not like this, but something is just very off with San Francisco. You know, the halo effect. When you've heard so many good things about a place, you feel like it'll be a good place. Time: 15:30 - 15:40 The buildings looks so good, so do the roads. How can it be unsafe if it feels so developed? That's when I realized, it's not always the truth. I don't think you can understand the ground reality of any place Time: 15:40 - 15:50 until you visit it yourself. And I keep thinking about this quote again and again. That, “Hard times create great men” “Great men create good times” “Good times create weak men” Time: 15:50 - 16:00 “Weak men create hard times” And I feel like somewhere this is what's going on in America, particularly San Francisco, because from what I could see, the infra, the tech, everything they’ve built is insane, Time: 16:00 - 16:10 incomparable to India. They did have good leaders. That's why I was so confused. Why is there so much homelessness? Why the drug crisis? The current state of it did not match how I had imagined it to be. Time: 16:10 - 16:20 You know even New York for that matter, the skyscrapers, Absolutely magnificent. They made me marvel at what us humans can build. I've never seen anything like that in my life. Time: 16:20 - 16:30 Beats Tokyo I’ll say. But, you know, as soon as I landed and reached the area and got out to get to my hotel, taking in the fresh New Yorker, I was like, wait, what the heck? It literally smelled like piss. Time: 16:30 - 16:40 Everything above me was great, but the minute you look down, you're like, what's going on? And I honestly wish I was exaggerating because I wanted to visit New York all along. Time: 16:40 - 16:50 I wanted to be pleasantly surprised, but this was exactly my first impression. Insane buildings. What a vibe. But why is there piss? Why are there so many rats? Time: 16:50 - 17:00 And why is there so much garbage on the street? Now, before you folks say, “Have you been to Bombay?” “Seen the slums?” Yes, I have, and we are fully aware of what it's like. It's not made out to be anything else in media. Time: 17:00 - 17:10 We know where we stand. We know where we lack. We have a long, long way to go. But, you know, America is branded very differently. Differently than its actual on ground reality. Time: 17:10 - 17:20 And I'm not refuting the good stuff. In America, you can literally get promoted much faster and reach a $250k salary in less than 3 to 4 years, which you cannot do in India. Time: 17:20 - 17:30 You also don't have to work 10-12 hours every day. You have fixed timings and you paid for all the extra hours, your weekend are off. None of these are also discussed in the whole purchasing power parity arguments. But also, on the other side, Time: 17:30 - 17:40 getting a job in America comes with a whole lot of anxiety or dealing with H-1b lottery. That's basically you can work hard, get a job, but at the end of the day, Time: 17:40 - 17:50 it's a lottery that decides if you get your work visa. And more than seven lakh applicants for less than two lakh work visas. We did a whole breakdown of it here. By the way, I interrupt this segment to share some news with all of you. Time: 17:50 - 18:00 So around one and a half years ago, we started a video editing cohort because we had this thesis that we are moving towards a world where it's becoming easier and easier to build products, Time: 18:00 - 18:10 but harder to get users. So distribution is going to become the mode. And, you know, somewhere that thesis was right? Because if you look at companies, founders, everybody is creating content right now. Time: 18:10 - 18:20 And honestly making compelling videos, understanding the algorithm is now a legitimate long term career. We at Aevy also are now in the middle of our 7th cohort, and we have trained over 1800+ Time: 18:20 - 18:30 video editors who are now working with companies like Blinkit, Zerodha, Zoho, and folks like Ali Abdaal, Nikhil Kamath, Tanmay Bhat. Time: 18:30 - 18:40 you know, 80% of students who applied for placements have got jobs with average salaries of 4.5 lakh per annum. And I don't know if I can legally say this, okay. But honestly, anybody and everybody who joins Time: 18:40 - 18:50 the cohort is willing to finish the cohort, get their portfolios ready. We have a job for you, and we have worked very, very hard to create this recruiter Time: 18:50 - 19:00 network of 500 companies. Who are all hiring multiple video editors from us, by the way. You know, while we have so many people complaining about not getting jobs on the internet, I keep telling them, come to our cohort, we can help. Time: 19:00 - 19:10 But then they say, oh, it's video editing. But honestly, that's what the demand is right now. And you need to be okay with a job that's not software engineering. And I'm not exaggerating. We have more recruiters than students Time: 19:10 - 19:20 sitting for placements as of now and getting packages higher than engineering colleges. You know what? Don't take my word for it. Come experience it firsthand. Time: 19:20 - 19:30 We're doing a free masterclass where you can learn how to edit videos like AevyTV, understand content better, get to know our instructors, know what our community is like and see some of the work that our cohort students have done before. Time: 19:30 - 19:40 And more than anything, knowing content, knowing editing will help all of you build leverage for yourself. So come watch it even if you don't want to join the cohort because you might just end up learning Time: 19:40 - 19:50 something new. I’m putting the masterclass link in description. See you there. We also don't discuss the cost of living away from family. The emotional cost of being alone, and feeling a little bit scared Time: 19:50 - 20:00 because you're not in your homeland. We don't discuss how in India, a person earning even like 20 lakhs can easily afford a cook, maid and even a babysitter for that matter. Is that possible with $150,000 in USA? Time: 20:00 - 20:10 It’s not. The air quality, pollution, yes, it's much better. Civic sense is much better. You do lead a healthier life, but when and if you fall sick Time: 20:10 - 20:20 or get chronic illness, the cost of healthcare in America is absolutely bonkers. Health care spending in the U.S Time: 20:20 - 20:30 is estimated to be $3.5 trillion. They build our insurance company over $3 million for the cost of transplant. Time: 20:30 - 20:40 $200 for a blood test, $20,000 for one single stent. Just exorbitant. I mean yeah, people say it's broken. But, broken is one thing, Time: 20:40 - 20:50 making it so expensive that it's practically inaccessible is another. You know, that's also when I realized, most of the arguments made on Twitter, around this, are by young folks Time: 20:50 - 21:00 who have actually never faced any health anomaly. I got to experience it firsthand. So let me share my experience. So it's a blood test Time: 21:00 - 21:10 I've been wanting to get for the longest time, which is only available in America. Kudos to America for being way ahead in medical R&D, but access to these medicines quite a task. Time: 21:10 - 21:20 So firstly, to get this test we required a prescription from a doctor in America because they didn't accept the Indian doctor prescription. So for that we needed an appointment with the doctor. Time: 21:20 - 21:30 This was literally impossible in San Francisco because, doctors don't seem to want to see patients. They all leave by 4-5 p.m. So after days of trying to find a doc, we finally got an appointment with the doctor in Los Angeles. Time: 21:30 - 21:40 It was very professional, good doctor. But guess what the consultation costed us? This consultation of half an hour costed us $652 Time: 21:40 - 21:50 That's ₹54,000 for a half an hour consultations. I just- I just couldn't wrap my head around this. Time: 21:50 - 22:00 Now, finally, after the most expensive consultation of our lives, we got the prescription. Next, we had to get the blood test done. Guess how much the test costed us? Time: 22:00 - 22:10 Take a wild guess. $2,000, which is ₹1.67 lakhs for blood test. And you know what? If you go to the emergency or ER, Time: 22:10 - 22:20 the cost of everything doubles. So God forbid you have a medical emergency, you are screwed. You literally cannot survive in America without health insurance. Anchor- “A teddy bear appeared on someone's medical bill.” Time: 22:20 - 22:30 Anchor- “As a cough support device for $57.” My friend was telling me how she had a ligament tear, and she had to pay $3,000 for a cast. Her insurance covered $1,500, Time: 22:30 - 22:40 but the remaining $1500 she had to pay out of her pocket. So based on my experience, everything I learned, I’ve created a whole chart for you guys. I added my inputs. So you can take a screenshot of this Time: 22:40 - 22:50 when you're comparing. $100,000 salary, is actually like an entry level salary in big cities like New York, but in states like Ohio, it could be considered a substantial income. Time: 22:50 - 23:00 So if you make $100,000 salary in S.F., and live in S.F, and if you want to save ₹1.5 lakhs a month, you need to be living below your means. But to save ₹1.5 lakh in Bangalore in India per month, this is what you need to be earning. Time: 23:00 - 23:10 How much you save in America will be subjected to where you live, the state taxes and your needs. For example cars, electronics much cheaper in America, but house is significant, more expensive. Time: 23:10 - 23:20 So when you're older and you need to buy a house for your family, and the cheapest you can get is a tiny house for $1 million in the valley. That's when the numbers and the ratios go bonkers. Time: 23:20 - 23:30 And that's why I say, numbers never tell the full story. In fact, I met a few Indians at Google I.O. event, who were making decent salaries, but they were not living in the main city. Time: 23:30 - 23:40 They lived an hour away, in single rooms, paid very little rent, save money, paid off their student loan, work double shifts and sent money back home. And when you do that, this “PPP” doesn't matter Time: 23:40 - 23:50 because you're saving are actually in absolutes. As in, you're earning in dollars and sending that $2,000, the full amount, back in India to be saved in India as Indian rupee. So that's a saving of nearly 1.6 lakh per month. Time: 23:50 - 24:00 And many Indians do that, you know. In fact, India is the largest recipient of remittances, with inflows of about $125 billion in 2023, Time: 24:00 - 24:10 or 3.4% of our GDP . So, yes, if you can go to America, get your H-1b sorted, spend very frugally pay off your loans, and get multiple promotions to reach Time: 24:10 - 24:20 that $400K-$500K salary. At that point, none of these arguments even matter. Your savings are going to be subjective to you, your lifestyle. Time: 24:20 - 24:30 If you are somebody who likes living life king size, then even $500,000 is not going to be sufficient for you in a big city in America. Hence, in my opinion, Purchasing Power Parity, Time: 24:30 - 24:40 only captures a narrow slice of reality. And after speaking to many Indians there, I realized one thing. You know we Indians, we can survive and thrive anywhere in the world Time: 24:40 - 24:50 if we put our minds to it. I feel like working hard is literally in our DNA. We leave our country because we feel like we can get more for the same amount of hard work there. Time: 24:50 - 25:00 Higher returns. And it make sense. But I think Indians working anywhere will beat their peers because that's how we are raised. If we decide we want to save two lakhs a month, we live below our means and save that amount. Time: 25:00 - 25:10 But that's also why I want to stay here, because I realize how much talent we have and all this talent, all these people, all they're looking for is an opportunity. Time: 25:10 - 25:20 And that's what I want to do here. I want to build here and create those opportunities for people, so they don't have to go chase the American dream, but feel like they've got a shot Time: 25:20 - 25:30 at social mobility here as well. And that's what we are trying. I want people to feel like they can get out of the rat race and build a good life here as well, and I know India has shortcomings and lots Time: 25:30 - 25:40 and lots of them, and we've got a long, long way to go. But if you don't take a shot at improving things, who will? Right? So yeah, that's all for today's video. This was a slightly different video Time: 25:40 - 25:50 than what we usually do on AevyTV. Let us know what you thought about it, what you took away from it. And if you have any experiences about America to share with us, please drop them in the comments below Time: 25:50 - 26:00 as somebody else might learn something from you. That's it for today's video. My name is Achina Maya. And please don't forget to hit the subscribe button. See you in the next video.

      "transcript": "Time: 00:04 - 00:06 Britain control a Time: 00:06 - 00:07 quarter of the world's landmass. Time: 00:07 - 00:09 Imagine one country Time: 00:09 - 00:10 ruling one fourth of Earth. Time: 00:10 - 00:13 But the even crazier part, Time: 00:13 - 00:14 just over a century later, Time: 00:14 - 00:16 economists are comparing Time: 00:16 - 00:18 the same Britain to Mississippi, Time: 00:18 - 00:20 which is the poorest state in America. Time: 00:20 - 00:22 I found it a little absurd. Time: 00:22 - 00:24 So I started digging into the numbers, Time: 00:24 - 00:26 and man, was I startled by what I learnt. Time: 00:26 - 00:29 I mean, Time: 00:29 - 00:29 how does the country go Time: 00:29 - 00:30 from ruling a fourth of humanity Time: 00:30 - 00:32 to struggling with basic stuff Time: 00:32 - 00:34 like health care, Time: 00:34 - 00:35 housing and wages? Time: 00:35 - 00:36 “Borrowing costs Time: 00:36 - 00:37 have reached a 27 year high.” Time: 00:37 - 00:39 What happened to all the wealth Time: 00:39 - 00:41 they took from all the nations? Time: 00:41 - 00:43 I had to find the accurate answers. Time: 00:43 - 00:45 So I did what I always do. Time: 00:45 - 00:47 I went there myself. Time: 00:47 - 00:49 I spent 10 days Time: 00:49 - 00:50 investigating modern Britain, Time: 00:50 - 00:52 speaking to people across classes, Time: 00:52 - 00:54 professions, locals, immigrants Time: 00:54 - 00:57 and the on ground reality Time: 00:57 - 00:58 I discovered was a reality is so complex. Time: 00:58 - 01:01 It changed Time: 01:01 - 01:02 everything I thought I knew Time: 01:02 - 01:03 about developed economies. Time: 01:03 - 01:05 “The rule here is Time: 01:05 - 01:06 if you're in a hole, stop digging.” Time: 01:06 - 01:07 So in classic Aevy style, Time: 01:07 - 01:09 I'm going to show you the good, Time: 01:09 - 01:10 the bad, Time: 01:10 - 01:11 and the ugly of the former Time: 01:11 - 01:13 Empire in transformation. Time: 01:13 - 01:27 From the moment I arrived at Heathrow, Time: 01:27 - 01:28 I was extremely excited Time: 01:28 - 01:30 because I've grown up reading Enid Time: 01:30 - 01:31 Blyton, Sherlock Holmes, Jane Austen, Time: 01:31 - 01:34 which are all set right here. Time: 01:34 - 01:36 As soon as I stepped out, Time: 01:36 - 01:37 I met my first local right Time: 01:37 - 01:39 here, and I start with the questions. Time: 01:39 - 01:41 He was from Nigeria Time: 01:41 - 01:42 and he had moved to London years ago. Time: 01:42 - 01:44 He was a driver Time: 01:44 - 01:45 and was living on the outskirts, paying Time: 01:45 - 01:47 1,700 pounds Time: 01:47 - 01:48 as rent for a family of four. Time: 01:48 - 01:50 It was a short chat Time: 01:50 - 01:51 but he was quite happy to be honest. Time: 01:51 - 01:53 As he said Time: 01:53 - 01:53 that the standard of education Time: 01:53 - 01:55 for his children in state schools Time: 01:55 - 01:57 here was way better Time: 01:57 - 01:58 what he would have been able Time: 01:58 - 01:59 to give them in his own country. Time: 01:59 - 02:01 He also casually mentioned Time: 02:01 - 02:02 that Nigeria is now Time: 02:02 - 02:03 one of the largest sources Time: 02:03 - 02:04 of immigrants to the UK. Time: 02:04 - 02:06 But he added with a smile, Time: 02:06 - 02:08 “Indians are still number one.” Time: 02:08 - 02:11 So I looked up the numbers. Time: 02:11 - 02:12 He was right. Time: 02:12 - 02:13 India ranks Time: 02:13 - 02:13 number one, making up 20% of immigrants Time: 02:13 - 02:16 that come to UK in 2023 alone. Time: 02:16 - 02:20 250,000 Indians moved here to study Time: 02:20 - 02:23 and work. Time: 02:23 - 02:23 You know, there's Time: 02:23 - 02:24 so much Indian influence in some areas. Time: 02:24 - 02:26 I mean, Time: 02:26 - 02:26 there are signs in Punjabi Time: 02:26 - 02:28 on railway stations in the areas Time: 02:28 - 02:29 like Southall in London. Time: 02:29 - 02:30 And this diversity isn't accidental. Time: 02:30 - 02:32 London has become Time: 02:32 - 02:33 a global epicenter for one simple reason. Time: 02:33 - 02:37 Money Time: 02:37 - 02:45 This one city is Time: 02:45 - 02:47 worth more than $618 billion. Time: 02:47 - 02:51 You know, Time: 02:51 - 02:51 that's larger Time: 02:51 - 02:52 than the entire economy of Argentina. Time: 02:52 - 02:55 It's a good thing and a bad thing. Time: 02:55 - 02:57 The bad parts, Time: 02:57 - 02:57 though, we’ll come to later. Time: 02:57 - 02:59 But the question is, Time: 02:59 - 03:00 why is London so insanely rich? Time: 03:00 - 03:03 See, when Britain Time: 03:03 - 03:03 ruled one fourth of the world. Time: 03:03 - 03:05 They built an entire financial system Time: 03:05 - 03:07 where global trade flowed through London. Time: 03:07 - 03:10 And even though the empire is gone, Time: 03:10 - 03:12 that system stayed. Time: 03:12 - 03:14 So I met this 29 year old Indian trader Time: 03:14 - 03:16 who's making around Time: 03:16 - 03:17 200,000 pounds in London. Time: 03:17 - 03:19 Who explained it perfectly. Time: 03:19 - 03:21 He's like- Time: 03:21 - 03:22 “look around you, Time: 03:22 - 03:23 we're literally Time: 03:23 - 03:24 in between New York and Tokyo. Time: 03:24 - 03:25 When New York closes, we start trading. Time: 03:25 - 03:28 When we wind up, Tokyo takes over. Time: 03:28 - 03:30 London is perfectly placed Time: 03:30 - 03:33 to be the world's trading hub.” Time: 03:33 - 03:34 And he was right. Time: 03:34 - 03:36 Walk through London's financial district Time: 03:36 - 03:38 and you'll see what this means. Time: 03:38 - 03:39 Every other building houses Time: 03:39 - 03:41 either a major bank, a law firm Time: 03:41 - 03:43 or a consulting company. Time: 03:43 - 03:45 Also, it's not just finance. Time: 03:45 - 03:47 I observed Time: 03:47 - 03:48 that London is also a powerhouse Time: 03:48 - 03:50 for scientific research. Time: 03:50 - 03:52 But, you know, one Time: 03:52 - 03:52 interesting thing Time: 03:52 - 03:53 I observed Time: 03:53 - 03:53 with some of the managers and founders, Time: 03:53 - 03:55 I spoke to Time: 03:55 - 03:55 there was the challenges faced by them, Time: 03:55 - 03:58 which are pretty much the same Time: 03:58 - 03:59 what we face here, Time: 03:59 - 04:01 and that is juggling Time: 04:01 - 04:02 and managing expenses in a business. Time: 04:02 - 04:04 You yourself must have Time: 04:04 - 04:06 faced this in your life. Time: 04:06 - 04:07 So recently, after trying Time: 04:07 - 04:08 multiple things, Time: 04:08 - 04:09 I found Odoo expenses Time: 04:09 - 04:11 which I want to share with you all. Time: 04:11 - 04:13 Odoo is basically an all-in-one Time: 04:13 - 04:14 software that handles everything Time: 04:14 - 04:16 from point of sale Time: 04:16 - 04:17 to inventory management, Time: 04:17 - 04:19 helping you run your business smoothly. Time: 04:19 - 04:21 Now, with their expenses app, Time: 04:21 - 04:22 you would no longer have to scramble Time: 04:22 - 04:24 with a large amount of paperwork Time: 04:24 - 04:26 and drown in chaos. Time: 04:26 - 04:27 You and your team Time: 04:27 - 04:28 then simply click Time: 04:28 - 04:29 photos of receipts Time: 04:29 - 04:30 on your phones, Time: 04:30 - 04:31 email them, Time: 04:31 - 04:32 or even manually upload it to the system. Time: 04:32 - 04:34 You can easily group Time: 04:34 - 04:35 multiple expenses under one group. Time: 04:35 - 04:38 The manager can approve everything Time: 04:38 - 04:39 with one click Time: 04:39 - 04:40 or ask for further clarification Time: 04:40 - 04:42 through chatter, Time: 04:42 - 04:43 and all of the reimbursements Time: 04:43 - 04:45 sync seamlessly Time: 04:45 - 04:46 with your accounting system. Time: 04:46 - 04:47 What's cool is how easily and seamlessly Time: 04:47 - 04:49 and handled Time: 04:49 - 04:50 the entire workflow from submission Time: 04:50 - 04:52 to approval to account integration. Time: 04:52 - 04:54 Even client related expenses Time: 04:54 - 04:56 automatically get tagged for invoicing. Time: 04:56 - 04:58 And as your business grows, Time: 04:58 - 04:59 you can just add more features Time: 04:59 - 05:00 to match your needs. Time: 05:00 - 05:02 The best part Time: 05:02 - 05:02 though, is your first Odoo Time: 05:02 - 05:04 app is free for life. Time: 05:04 - 05:06 So if you want to check out more, Time: 05:06 - 05:09 I am putting the link Time: 05:09 - 05:10 in description below. Time: 05:10 - 05:12 So during my visit, I was Time: 05:12 - 05:13 invited by Google DeepMind Time: 05:13 - 05:15 and the Royal Society for their Time: 05:15 - 05:16 AI for science forum. Time: 05:16 - 05:18 And this was hands down Time: 05:18 - 05:20 one of the most inspiring Time: 05:20 - 05:22 experiences of my life. Time: 05:22 - 05:23 I saw four Nobel laureates on stage met Time: 05:23 - 05:26 one of them. Time: 05:26 - 05:27 That's Jennifer Doudna, Time: 05:27 - 05:28 and she's the mind behind CRISPR. Time: 05:28 - 05:30 I hung out with Derek from Veritasium Time: 05:30 - 05:33 and also witnessed Time: 05:33 - 05:34 the brilliant research Time: 05:34 - 05:35 that's happening at DeepMind Time: 05:35 - 05:37 at the intersection of science and AI. Time: 05:37 - 05:39 You know, the people who I met here, Time: 05:39 - 05:40 a lot of them from London itself, Time: 05:40 - 05:42 they dedicated their whole lives Time: 05:42 - 05:45 to science and research, Time: 05:45 - 05:46 just working to push humanity forward. Time: 05:46 - 05:49 One of the standout moments for me Time: 05:49 - 05:50 was the talk on AlphaFold Time: 05:50 - 05:57 research year Time: 05:57 - 05:58 by mapping over 200 million Time: 05:58 - 06:00 protein structures. Time: 06:00 - 06:01 Imagine that a tool that turns years Time: 06:01 - 06:04 of painstaking research Time: 06:04 - 06:05 into mere minutes. Time: 06:05 - 06:07 This is literally accelerating Time: 06:07 - 06:09 drug discovery and vaccine development, Time: 06:09 - 06:11 and our Time: 06:11 - 06:11 understanding of diseases Time: 06:11 - 06:13 in ways that were once Time: 06:13 - 06:14 thought impossible. Time: 06:14 - 06:16 And I share this with you guys, Time: 06:16 - 06:17 because these two days Time: 06:17 - 06:18 really shifted my perspective Time: 06:18 - 06:20 about the world a little bit, Time: 06:20 - 06:21 when I saw all of this great work Time: 06:21 - 06:23 first hand. Time: 06:23 - 06:24 You know Time: 06:24 - 06:24 it was a testament Time: 06:24 - 06:25 to what brilliant humans are capable of Time: 06:25 - 06:28 and how the smartest minds Time: 06:28 - 06:29 are pushing the boundaries Time: 06:29 - 06:31 of AI and science. Time: 06:31 - 06:32 And this was all happening right here in Time: 06:32 - 06:36 London. Time: 06:36 - 06:39 This is where UK’s story Time: 06:39 - 06:41 gets really, really interesting. Time: 06:41 - 06:52 So one side Time: 06:52 - 06:53 you have this city, these people Time: 06:53 - 06:54 doing groundbreaking scientific Time: 06:54 - 06:56 research, moving global Time: 06:56 - 06:57 finance, attracting the world's Time: 06:57 - 06:59 best talent, Time: 06:59 - 07:00 brilliant transportation Time: 07:00 - 07:01 and connectivity. Time: 07:01 - 07:03 And then you have the rest of the UK. Time: 07:03 - 07:05 So one of the locals Time: 07:05 - 07:06 I met told me Time: 07:06 - 07:07 that “London might as well Time: 07:07 - 07:09 be a different country. Time: 07:09 - 07:10 If you're ambitious, Time: 07:10 - 07:11 there's no other choice. Time: 07:11 - 07:13 You have to come to London Time: 07:13 - 07:15 if you're in the UK.” Time: 07:15 - 07:16 All the money flows Time: 07:16 - 07:17 through the Golden Triangle, Time: 07:17 - 07:19 that's Oxford, Cambridge or London. Time: 07:19 - 07:21 I was like, Time: 07:21 - 07:22 what about the other cities, Time: 07:22 - 07:23 there are top universities Time: 07:23 - 07:24 spread across UK. Right? Time: 07:24 - 07:26 So he was like- “yeah, Time: 07:26 - 07:27 but you still have to move here Time: 07:27 - 07:29 if you really want to make it”. Time: 07:29 - 07:31 This made me curious. Time: 07:31 - 07:32 So I dug deeper into this Time: 07:32 - 07:34 because this was a recurring comment Time: 07:34 - 07:36 I kept hearing from everyone. Time: 07:36 - 07:37 So there's this concept that I learnt Time: 07:37 - 07:39 about which the economists Time: 07:39 - 07:40 call a ‘two speed economy’. Time: 07:40 - 07:42 It's basically Time: 07:42 - 07:43 when one part of the country Time: 07:43 - 07:44 charges ahead Time: 07:44 - 07:45 and the rest of it lags behind, Time: 07:45 - 07:47 kind of like a business pouring Time: 07:47 - 07:48 all its resources into one Time: 07:48 - 07:50 ultra profitable department, Time: 07:50 - 07:52 while the rest of it is neglected. Time: 07:52 - 07:54 You know, this is Time: 07:54 - 07:55 what's happening to UK right now. Time: 07:55 - 07:57 People literally talk about UK as London Time: 07:57 - 08:00 and the rest of UK. Time: 08:00 - 08:02 Let me show you some interesting stats. Time: 08:02 - 08:04 You know London generates Time: 08:04 - 08:05 almost half of Britain's Time: 08:05 - 08:07 financial services revenue, Time: 08:07 - 08:09 but it only has 13% Time: 08:09 - 08:11 of Britain's population. Time: 08:11 - 08:13 So if you were to remove London's Time: 08:13 - 08:14 output and headcount from Britain, Time: 08:14 - 08:16 it would shave 14% of British Time: 08:16 - 08:19 living standards. Time: 08:19 - 08:20 Let me put this in perspective. Time: 08:20 - 08:22 Let's say Time: 08:22 - 08:22 if you were to remove San Time: 08:22 - 08:23 Francisco's opulent output U.S. Time: 08:23 - 08:25 GDP per capita would only dip by 4%. Time: 08:25 - 08:29 If you remove Mumbai from India, Time: 08:29 - 08:30 it would dip by 5 to 6%. Time: 08:30 - 08:32 If you remove Germany's Time: 08:32 - 08:33 most productive city, Munich, Time: 08:33 - 08:35 only 1% would go. Time: 08:35 - 08:37 But for UK, Time: 08:37 - 08:39 man, the magnitude of UK's Time: 08:39 - 08:41 economic dependency on London. Time: 08:41 - 08:46 This, by the Time: 08:46 - 08:47 way, has also had its own repercussions. Time: 08:47 - 08:50 Let me tell you the story of a few locals Time: 08:50 - 08:52 I met on this journey. Time: 08:52 - 08:53 Their stories will shine a spotlight Time: 08:53 - 08:55 on what's really happening. Time: 08:55 - 08:57 So one of the gentlemen I met, Time: 08:57 - 08:58 he had come to UK, Manchester for masters Time: 08:58 - 09:01 and he was now doing Time: 09:01 - 09:01 a marketing job in London Time: 09:01 - 09:03 because he wasn't getting good pay Time: 09:03 - 09:04 anywhere else. Time: 09:04 - 09:05 He was really distressed Time: 09:05 - 09:06 about his housing, Time: 09:06 - 09:07 and he told me the story Time: 09:07 - 09:08 of how he was paying Time: 09:08 - 09:09 950 pounds Time: 09:09 - 09:10 for a one bedroom flat in south London. Time: 09:10 - 09:12 And then one day, Time: 09:12 - 09:13 suddenly, out of nowhere, Time: 09:13 - 09:15 his landlord casually says- Time: 09:15 - 09:17 “next month, rent is going up by 26% Time: 09:17 - 09:19 pay 1,200 pounds or leave”. Time: 09:19 - 09:21 He tried reasoning with him, telling him, Time: 09:21 - 09:23 you know- “I've lived here Time: 09:23 - 09:23 for a long time. Time: 09:23 - 09:24 I'm a good tenant”, but no luck. Time: 09:24 - 09:27 That 26% was non negotiable. Time: 09:27 - 09:30 And it's not just him. Time: 09:30 - 09:31 In 2022, London rents spiked by 17%. Time: 09:31 - 09:36 The biggest jump since 2007. Time: 09:36 - 09:38 You know, average Time: 09:38 - 09:39 single earners in London now Time: 09:39 - 09:41 spend half their income on rent. Time: 09:41 - 09:48 And here's the shocking part. Time: 09:48 - 09:50 House prices have shot up 1,000% Time: 09:50 - 09:53 since the 1980s, Time: 09:53 - 09:54 while the wages have barely kept up. Time: 09:54 - 09:57 Why? Time: 09:57 - 09:58 See councils Time: 09:58 - 09:59 used to build 100,000 homes every year, Time: 09:59 - 10:01 but they sold them off in the 80s Time: 10:01 - 10:03 and never built more. Time: 10:03 - 10:05 So now there are fewer homes, Time: 10:05 - 10:06 more people who need them, and prices Time: 10:06 - 10:09 that keep climbing higher and higher. Time: 10:09 - 10:11 It's like everyone's fighting over Time: 10:11 - 10:12 fewer and fewer spaces, Time: 10:12 - 10:14 while paying more than ever before. Time: 10:14 - 10:16 I’ll tell you another thing Time: 10:16 - 10:17 I learnt about housing and property. Time: 10:17 - 10:19 Something called inheritance tax. Time: 10:19 - 10:20 Let's say Time: 10:20 - 10:21 you want to avoid paying Time: 10:21 - 10:21 these exorbitant rents, Time: 10:21 - 10:23 and you put together money Time: 10:23 - 10:24 to buy a property, Time: 10:24 - 10:25 and then eventually Time: 10:25 - 10:25 you want to pass it on to your kids, Time: 10:25 - 10:27 that also they've made difficult Time: 10:27 - 10:29 because your child Time: 10:29 - 10:30 has to pay 40% inheritance tax Time: 10:30 - 10:33 just to inherit this property Time: 10:33 - 10:35 from the parent. Time: 10:35 - 10:37 Now talking about taxes, Time: 10:37 - 10:42 that- “it's weird Time: 10:42 - 10:44 how my household income Time: 10:44 - 10:45 has literally doubled Time: 10:45 - 10:46 from what it was ten years ago, Time: 10:46 - 10:48 and still somehow Time: 10:48 - 10:49 we have less money to spend”. Time: 10:49 - 10:51 He was like- “we Time: 10:51 - 10:52 no longer have a car payment, Time: 10:52 - 10:53 we eat out less, we get coffee less, Time: 10:53 - 10:55 we haven't had a credit card for over Time: 10:55 - 10:57 five years, have no credit card payments, Time: 10:57 - 11:00 and somehow still Time: 11:00 - 11:01 we have less disposable income Time: 11:01 - 11:03 now than we did before. Time: 11:03 - 11:05 Just buying the things we need to survive Time: 11:05 - 11:08 is taking up 95% of our money. Time: 11:08 - 11:11 Now the question here is, Time: 11:11 - 11:13 why has it gotten this bad? Time: 11:13 - 11:16 Well, the UK is Time: 11:16 - 11:20 broke Time: 11:20 - 11:30 Austerity through two successive Time: 11:30 - 11:32 extraordinarily expensive Time: 11:32 - 11:34 and damaging crises Time: 11:34 - 11:35 Brexit, then Covid, Time: 11:35 - 11:37 then the Russia-Ukraine war Time: 11:37 - 11:39 has left the UK Time: 11:39 - 11:40 with an enormous debt burden. Time: 11:40 - 11:42 See the pandemic forced the government Time: 11:42 - 11:44 to pour billions into relief efforts Time: 11:44 - 11:46 further ballooning the national debt Time: 11:46 - 11:48 and leaving Time: 11:48 - 11:49 less room for crucial investments Time: 11:49 - 11:50 that are required Time: 11:50 - 11:51 in housing and healthcare. Time: 11:51 - 11:53 With the Bank of England Time: 11:53 - 11:54 hiking interest rates Time: 11:54 - 11:55 to combat inflation, Time: 11:55 - 11:57 the cost of servicing Time: 11:57 - 11:58 that debt has skyrocketed Time: 11:58 - 12:00 further straining public finances. Time: 12:00 - 12:02 You know, Time: 12:02 - 12:02 even the energy crisis from Time: 12:02 - 12:04 the war is so bad Time: 12:04 - 12:05 that the British households Time: 12:05 - 12:06 were projected to pay three times Time: 12:06 - 12:08 the previous price Time: 12:08 - 12:09 just to heat their homes Time: 12:09 - 12:11 during the winter. Time: 12:11 - 12:12 One of my friends was telling me Time: 12:12 - 12:14 that it was so absurd to be in London Time: 12:14 - 12:16 during this Christmas, Time: 12:16 - 12:16 because most of the houses were dark. Time: 12:16 - 12:19 Very few people lit their houses Time: 12:19 - 12:21 because they simply don't have money Time: 12:21 - 12:23 to pay Time: 12:23 - 12:23 the extremely high electricity bills. Time: 12:23 - 12:26 He even jokingly said, Time: 12:26 - 12:28 that- “if Time: 12:28 - 12:28 you want exposure, Time: 12:28 - 12:29 sure yeah, come to London, Time: 12:29 - 12:31 but if you're not in finance or tech Time: 12:31 - 12:32 and you want to make money, Time: 12:32 - 12:34 run in the opposite direction.” Time: 12:34 - 12:37 Also, this is not it. Time: 12:37 - 12:39 Let me tell you the next problem. Time: 12:39 - 12:40 So I met a nurse. Time: 12:40 - 12:42 She was in her mid 30s, Time: 12:42 - 12:43 full time in the National Health Service, Time: 12:43 - 12:45 earning around 45,000 pounds. Time: 12:45 - 12:47 She's very proud of her Time: 12:47 - 12:49 profession, saying Time: 12:49 - 12:50 that- “you know, Time: 12:50 - 12:50 the NHS was once Time: 12:50 - 12:52 the jewel in Britain's crown. Time: 12:52 - 12:54 But now-” Time: 12:54 - 12:54 she said, Time: 12:54 - 12:55 “-every single person is leaving. Time: 12:55 - 12:58 ”We're not just understaffed, Time: 12:58 - 13:00 we're burnt out. Time: 13:00 - 13:02 I've worked through Covid Time: 13:02 - 13:03 endless winter crises. Time: 13:03 - 13:05 And now? Time: 13:05 - 13:06 The queue for operations is over Time: 13:06 - 13:08 7 million people. Time: 13:08 - 13:09 It's bonkers.” Time: 13:09 - 13:14 The National Health Service Time: 13:14 - 13:16 has 124,000 empty positions right now. Time: 13:16 - 13:20 From doctors to nurses to support staff. Time: 13:20 - 13:23 And thousands more are planning to quit. Time: 13:23 - 13:26 Where are they going? Time: 13:26 - 13:27 They are either jumping to private health Time: 13:27 - 13:28 care for better pay Time: 13:28 - 13:29 or leaving the country entirely. Time: 13:29 - 13:31 Meanwhile, 7.4 Time: 13:31 - 13:33 million Time: 13:33 - 13:34 people are waiting for Time: 13:34 - 13:35 treatments and surgeries. Time: 13:35 - 13:37 Even when the NHS gets more money, Time: 13:37 - 13:39 it can't keep up Time: 13:39 - 13:40 because they're dealing with Time: 13:40 - 13:41 an aging population, expensive Time: 13:41 - 13:43 new drugs Time: 13:43 - 13:43 and trying to match staff salaries Time: 13:43 - 13:45 with inflation. Time: 13:45 - 13:47 And you know the really scary part? Time: 13:47 - 13:48 These hospital are spending Time: 13:48 - 13:50 so much on emergencies Time: 13:50 - 13:51 that they don't have any funds Time: 13:51 - 13:53 to train their staff Time: 13:53 - 13:54 or even buy new equipment. Time: 13:54 - 13:56 It's kind of like fixing a leaking boat, Time: 13:56 - 13:58 but more and more holes Time: 13:58 - 14:00 keep on appearing. Time: 14:00 - 14:01 And you know who's paying the price Time: 14:01 - 14:02 for all of this? Time: 14:02 - 14:04 People like this nurse. Time: 14:04 - 14:06 The story of modern Time: 14:06 - 14:07 Britain at a human level is quite stark. Time: 14:07 - 14:10 From struggling Time: 14:10 - 14:11 to build a home Time: 14:11 - 14:12 to finding affordable health care, Time: 14:12 - 14:14 every single person is feeling the pangs Time: 14:14 - 14:17 of a decaying nation. Time: 14:17 - 14:19 Except the folks in finance, I guess. Time: 14:19 - 14:20 Everyone I spoke to who worked in Time: 14:20 - 14:22 finance was pretty happy. Time: 14:22 - 14:24 Now, there’s one more thing about London Time: 14:24 - 14:26 and this finance sector that I learnt. Time: 14:26 - 14:28 So you know how London success Time: 14:28 - 14:29 in the financial sector Time: 14:29 - 14:31 makes the pound grow stronger. Time: 14:31 - 14:33 That's great for finance. Time: 14:33 - 14:35 But did you know it’s Time: 14:35 - 14:36 not always the best for the economy. Time: 14:36 - 14:37 See a pricier currency Time: 14:37 - 14:39 increased the cost of British exports, Time: 14:39 - 14:41 meaning fewer Time: 14:41 - 14:42 contracts, weaker Time: 14:42 - 14:43 profits and zero budget Time: 14:43 - 14:44 to invest in new machinery Time: 14:44 - 14:46 or staff training for this whole economy Time: 14:46 - 14:48 reliant on financial services, Time: 14:48 - 14:50 has also led to the ‘productivity trap’ Time: 14:50 - 14:52 that Britain is stuck in. Time: 14:52 - 14:54 You see, less investment Time: 14:54 - 14:55 means outdated equipment, Time: 14:55 - 14:57 which means lower productivity, Time: 14:57 - 14:59 which leads to lower wages, Time: 14:59 - 15:00 which then leads to brain drain Time: 15:00 - 15:02 as talent leaves the country. Time: 15:02 - 15:04 And meanwhile, Time: 15:04 - 15:05 manufacturing continues to languish. Time: 15:05 - 15:08 Economists call this phenomena Time: 15:08 - 15:10 ‘Dutch Disease’, Time: 15:10 - 15:11 when one booming sector, Time: 15:11 - 15:12 like London's finance, Time: 15:12 - 15:14 accidentally chokes the rest. Time: 15:14 - 15:16 So in case you were conjuring aspirations Time: 15:16 - 15:19 to move the UK, Time: 15:19 - 15:20 this is a reality check Time: 15:20 - 15:21 that you unfortunately need to hear. Time: 15:21 - 15:24 Unless you're in finance or maybe tech. Time: 15:24 - 15:40 Hold up. Time: 15:40 - 15:41 I want to take a moment here Time: 15:41 - 15:42 to share an update on a bet Time: 15:42 - 15:43 we took two years back. Time: 15:43 - 15:45 So back then, Time: 15:45 - 15:46 we launched our very first video Time: 15:46 - 15:47 editing cohort Time: 15:47 - 15:48 betting big Time: 15:48 - 15:49 on the idea Time: 15:49 - 15:50 that distribution Time: 15:50 - 15:51 would become the moat of every company, Time: 15:51 - 15:53 and that people who could edit content Time: 15:53 - 15:55 and make videos go viral Time: 15:55 - 15:57 would be in high demand. Time: 15:57 - 15:58 Fast forward to now. Time: 15:58 - 15:59 The content creation world Time: 15:59 - 16:00 has absolutely exploded. Time: 16:00 - 16:02 We have seen top entrepreneurs Time: 16:02 - 16:04 making content, Time: 16:04 - 16:05 and even heads of state Time: 16:05 - 16:06 and CEOs are featuring on YouTube Time: 16:06 - 16:08 channels. Time: 16:08 - 16:08 It's honestly wild Time: 16:08 - 16:09 how this space is growing. Time: 16:09 - 16:11 Meanwhile, Time: 16:11 - 16:12 we have also reached our 10th cohort, Time: 16:12 - 16:14 having trained over 3000 editors. Time: 16:14 - 16:17 You know, Time: 16:17 - 16:18 many have gone on to work Time: 16:18 - 16:19 with some of the biggest creators Time: 16:19 - 16:20 and companies, Time: 16:20 - 16:21 and even we hit 1 million Time: 16:21 - 16:23 subscribers ourselves Time: 16:23 - 16:24 thanks to the amazing Time: 16:24 - 16:25 contributions of our students.

Time: 16:57 - 16:58 The link is in the description. Time: 16:58 - 17:00 You know, Time: 17:00 - 17:00 Britain's story isn't just about One Time: 17:00 - 17:02 Nation's decline.

Time: 17:20 - 17:23 Empires fall Time: 17:23 - 17:24 not just from external invasions, Time: 17:24 - 17:26 but from within Time: 17:26 - 17:27 when their foundation starts crumbling, Time: 17:27 - 17:30 one brick at a time. Time: 17:30 - 17:32 You know, Time: 17:32 - 17:32 every time I see a nation Time: 17:32 - 17:34 that was once the pride of the world Time: 17:34 - 17:36 or some unstoppable economic titan, I'm Time: 17:36 - 17:39 always reminded Time: 17:39 - 17:40 of how everything is cyclical. Time: 17:40 - 17:43 And there's a quote Time: 17:43 - 17:44 I keep coming back to, Time: 17:44 - 17:46 one that sums it up perfectly. Time: 17:46 - 17:48 “Hard times Time: 17:48 - 17:49 create strong men, strong men create Time: 17:49 - 17:52 good times, good times create weak men, Time: 17:52 - 17:55 and weak men create hard times” Time: 17:55 - 17:58 It's this vicious cycle of growth Time: 17:58 - 18:01 and decline, push and pull, Time: 18:01 - 18:03 success and self-sabotage. Time: 18:03 - 18:05 And if you watch history long enough, Time: 18:05 - 18:07 you see the cycle replay again Time: 18:07 - 18:09 and again and again. Time: 18:09 - 18:10 Nations, companies, even personal lives, Time: 18:10 - 18:14 nobody is immune. Time: 18:14 - 18:15 You know why Time: 18:15 - 18:16 I keep saying I'm bullish on India Time: 18:16 - 18:17 right now? Time: 18:17 - 18:18 In some ways, India still battles Time: 18:18 - 18:21 through its hard times. Time: 18:21 - 18:22 The infrastructure is lagging. Time: 18:22 - 18:24 Pollution is high. Time: 18:24 - 18:25 Inequality is blatant. Time: 18:25 - 18:27 But I feel like it's on an ascend. Time: 18:27 - 18:30 Within that Time: 18:30 - 18:31 struggle is the energy of a place Time: 18:31 - 18:33 that's genuinely hungry Time: 18:33 - 18:34 to create something new. Time: 18:34 - 18:36 If the UK system feels like Time: 18:36 - 18:38 it's strangled by taxes, bureaucracy Time: 18:38 - 18:40 and historically “good Time: 18:40 - 18:42 times” that turned weak, Time: 18:42 - 18:43 India might do the opposite. Time: 18:43 - 18:45 It's rough around the edges, yes. Time: 18:45 - 18:47 But it's also where Time: 18:47 - 18:48 entire sectors are booming. Time: 18:48 - 18:50 See, I'm not saying India is Paradise. Time: 18:50 - 18:52 It is not! Time: 18:52 - 18:53 Just like I'm also not saying UK Time: 18:53 - 18:55 is doomed forever. Time: 18:55 - 18:56 I'm sure they'll recover. Time: 18:56 - 18:57 I really hope they do. Time: 18:57 - 18:59 But I do feel strongly Time: 18:59 - 19:00 that in every country, Time: 19:00 - 19:01 someone has to take responsibility Time: 19:01 - 19:04 for creating the next wave Time: 19:04 - 19:05 of jobs and prosperity. Time: 19:05 - 19:07 And at some point, Time: 19:07 - 19:08 you want to be part of the story Time: 19:08 - 19:10 that's on the upswing, Time: 19:10 - 19:11 lending your shoulder to the wheel Time: 19:11 - 19:13 when it matters. Time: 19:13 - 19:14 Not after Time: 19:14 - 19:14 everything is settled and bloated, Time: 19:14 - 19:16 but during the climb. Time: 19:16 - 19:18 So maybe we can keep that line Time: 19:18 - 19:19 from curdling into complacency later on. Time: 19:19 - 19:22 Because yes, Time: 19:22 - 19:23 it would be easier to sit back Time: 19:23 - 19:25 and reap the benefits of an already Time: 19:25 - 19:27 rich country Time: 19:27 - 19:28 until you realize that already Time: 19:28 - 19:30 rich is precisely Time: 19:30 - 19:31 what triggers Time: 19:31 - 19:32 the next unraveling in this cycle. Time: 19:32 - 19:34 We humans, we thrive in creation mode, Time: 19:34 - 19:38 not complacency mode. Time: 19:38 - 19:40 Well, for me personally, Time: 19:40 - 19:41 I'd rather be part of a growth story Time: 19:41 - 19:43 where I can help create Time: 19:43 - 19:45 better times for the next generation Time: 19:45 - 19:47 instead of drifting inside a system Time: 19:47 - 19:49 in decline. Time: 19:49 - 19:50 Because of this, Time: 19:50 - 19:50 anything history has taught us Time: 19:50 - 19:52 is that every golden age eventually ends.

The world doesn’t know the actual prowess of the Indian army as India\nhas always been defensive because of its peaceful policies.",

Cap drivers are speeding through reels Time: 00:10 - 00:20 while on the highway. Every mother or housewife I've recently met is deep into level 6,000 of Candy Crush. Time: 00:20 - 00:30 Tasty. Our bathroom breaks have gotten so much longer and dinner dates have started to feel Time: 00:30 - 00:40 quite quiet. Clearly, there's something a miss. An invisible virus of sorts is spreading. We're changing little by little. Time: 00:40 - 00:50 [Music] Time: 00:50 - 01:00 Something is rotting. ing our attention [Music] and I needed to know what is causing it. Time: 01:20 - 01:30 [Music] [Music] Time: 01:30 - 01:40 This is Coco Melon, every infant's favorite show. It has 193 million subscribers on YouTube and over 200 billion views. Time: 01:40 - 01:50 [Music] Co melon. Time: 01:50 - 02:00 Co melon. [Music] What you're seeing here is how children react to the Coco Melon soundtrack. Time: 02:00 - 02:10 They're put into an almost translike state. And this happens by design. But their success is backed by a sinister little experiment. See, what they would Time: 02:10 - 02:20 do is trap a child in front of two screens. On one, Coco Melon would be playing and on the other, visuals of regular everyday activity that a child couldn't care less about. They'd then Time: 02:20 - 02:30 note down every point where the child was losing interest in their program, and they'd later fill those points with oversaturated colors or sudden movements that triggered a response in the infant. Time: 02:30 - 02:40 That way, the child would have to keep watching whether they wanted to or not. And if you really think about it, this is very hard to differentiate from an Time: 02:40 - 02:50 actual drug addiction. [Music] Clearly, the situation is terrifying for children. But what about you? Time: 02:50 - 03:00 Okay, imagine you're just back home from work after a long day. You take out your phone to feel a tiny little upper. You wonder if there's been any notifications Time: 03:00 - 03:10 in the last few hours and log onto your favorite social media app. Except it takes a split second before your Time: 03:10 - 03:20 notifications are revealed. This isn't because of your slow internet speed or some glitch. It's a calculated move by tech giants who understand that by Time: 03:20 - 03:30 creating anticipation, they'll be able to trigger more dopamine in your brain. Hence, ensuring that you are more addicted to the process of checking notifications than the notifications Time: 03:30 - 03:40 themselves. This is one of countless tricks used by tech giants. The key word here is addiction and it's happening Time: 03:40 - 03:50 right under our noses. I mean, it's exactly the kind of thing that a that a hacker like myself would come up with because you're exploiting a vulnerability in in human psychology. the inventors, Time: 03:50 - 04:00 creators, it's all of these people um understood this consciously and we did Time: 04:00 - 04:10 it anyway. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimates that 64 million people worldwide suffer from drug addiction. Meanwhile, the number of people who Time: 04:10 - 04:20 suffer from social media addiction is estimated to be around 210 million. The drug cartle business has had centuries to amass such a huge market share. But Time: 04:20 - 04:30 the dopamine cartle is just an emerging startup in comparison and it's already got three times the market share. See, what keeps me up at night isn't my own Time: 04:30 - 04:40 dopamine dependencies. It's when I think about the kind of content today's generations are exposed to and what effects it could be having on their brains. Time: 04:40 - 04:50 I mean what the is this? This virus cannot spread further and Time: 04:50 - 05:00 yeah it is a virus because it has infiltrated our culture in the blink of an eye and before it fully corrupts the last few brain cells we have left, we Time: 05:00 - 05:10 have to understand its symptoms. how it affects your ability to focus, your ability to remember things, and even your ability to think critically. Hopefully, we can still fight it. So, Time: 05:10 - 05:20 let's break it down. This is the dorso lateral preffrontal Time: 05:20 - 05:30 cortex. That's the part of your brain that's responsible for your ability to focus and pay attention. And that's our first pit stop. Time: 05:30 - 05:40 Let me ask you this. Have you noticed yourself or people around you losing Time: 05:40 - 05:50 their train of thought more often lately? Or maybe you find yourself often saying the phrase, \"Wait, what were we talking about? Do you want to know why Time: 05:50 - 06:00 that is? On the left is a kid from your parents' generation. She wants attention, but her mom is busy doing 200 things simultaneously like moms usually do. She Time: 06:00 - 06:10 doesn't give up and does what she knows best, throwing a tantrum. Eventually, this devious little child manages to manipulate her mom into giving her the Time: 06:10 - 06:20 attention she needs. On the right, we have the modern-day kid. His parents handed him a tablet and access to dopamine-driven content for Time: 06:20 - 06:30 children found on the internet. a perfect recipe to avoid his tantrums. This kid doesn't know it yet, but not getting his parents' attention is now Time: 06:30 - 06:40 causing him to lose his ability to pay attention when needed. Why? Because his prefrontal cortex is being fed so much dopamine so fast and so often. For your Time: 06:40 - 06:50 brain to normalize these levels of dopamine spikes would result in your baseline being raised, which means that anything lesser would make you go, Time: 06:50 - 07:00 \"Nope, let's move on to something else.\" In fact, you might already be experiencing some of these symptoms like your frustration when the Wi-Fi speed is slow or your need to watch YouTube Time: 07:00 - 07:10 videos at 1.2x speeds or why children are facing a social media crisis so prematurely. Research suggests that our attention spans have reduced from 2.5 Time: 07:10 - 07:20 minutes in 2003 to under 47 seconds in recent years. So I guess what I'm trying to say is [Music] Time: 07:20 - 07:30 Sorry, what was I talking about? You uh you were talking about attention spans, right? My bad. Sorry, I got distracted Time: 07:30 - 07:40 by you. We'd like to thank our partner for this video, Udu. We have spoken in the past about ODO's customizable suite of apps that has helped scale multiple businesses, but this time UDO is Time: 07:40 - 07:50 bringing more than 20,000 experts under one roof for you to network and learn from at UDu community days and we will Time: 07:50 - 08:00 be there as well. So across days, you will find 200 plus sessions from influencers and guest speakers. Plus, you'll have product demos, interactive zones, amazing food and music that you Time: 08:00 - 08:10 can vive to. And there's an afterparty as well. You'll also get an early look at the latest and most improved version of ODO that's ODO 19 and learn how to Time: 08:10 - 08:20 leverage its new features to work for your organization. This is happening on the 13th and 14th of August in Gandhiagar. And the best part is you can attend both days for absolutely free and Time: 08:20 - 08:30 bring your doubts to UDU community days. So what are you waiting for? Sign up for UDO community days from the link in description. Time: 08:30 - 08:40 This is the hippoc campus where memories of past events are stored. And this is the amygdala where all your emotional Time: 08:40 - 08:50 memories are stored and they function in fascinating ways. I want you to try an experiment. Try to Time: 08:50 - 09:00 remember a memory of yours. Something you're quite fond of. Perhaps it's a birthday party from a few years ago. Time: 09:00 - 09:10 Yours back when you still had short hair. Where all your loved ones were there. Even your partner at the time was there. No, not her. The one with the straight hair. She'd come all the way Time: 09:10 - 09:20 from Delhi for your birthday. And she brought your favorite cake. What was it? Diramisu. No, wait. You hate tiramisu. Was it pineapple? Oh, no. Wait. It was Time: 09:20 - 09:30 black forest kick. The candles were lit. The laughs were plenty. And it was just the best time ever. Except there's something weird and fascinating about Time: 09:30 - 09:40 this memory. You're seeing it in third person view. At least seven out of 10 of you are. But when you lift out the memory, you saw it all from a different perspective. No. Time: 09:40 - 09:50 Happy birthday to you. From your own eyes. Time: 09:50 - 10:00 It is widely accepted among neuroscientists that most people don't really recall a memory as much as they recreate it. You're not pulling it out of a saved file and revisiting the same Time: 10:00 - 10:10 data each time. Rather, you're remembering the last time you remember this memory. This process is called reconsolidation. Time: 10:10 - 10:20 But what's more, the emotion you're feeling while recalling a memory often alters the details of the memory itself. This is what allows us to erase all the anxieties and heartbreaks of college and Time: 10:20 - 10:30 eventually look back at it with rose tinted glasses. What this seems to imply is that your Time: 10:30 - 10:40 memory is a very unreliable and delicate system and yet it's what gives us our personality. And this incredible but fragile faculty is under attack. It's Time: 10:40 - 10:50 going through drastic changes because of a process called cognitive processes. That's when you externalize or delegate tasks like problem solving, decision making and um memory recollection to Time: 10:50 - 11:00 devices like calculators, chat, GPT, AI and even teleprompterss. Is that it? This is encapsulated Time: 11:00 - 11:10 perfectly by something called the Google effect. It refers to the idea that our brains are less likely to remember information if it knows that we can easily find it online. Just this week, Time: 11:10 - 11:20 an MIT study found that students relying on Chad GPT to write essays had the flattest brain activity patterns and could barely quote their own work Time: 11:20 - 11:30 minutes later. Evidence of what the researchers called cognitive debt. For today's kids, this is especially concerning since they're largely given Time: 11:30 - 11:40 up on habits like reading and memorizing. They won't be exercising their memory at all. A lot of these kids don't know how to read because they have Time: 11:40 - 11:50 had things read to them or they can click a button and have something read out loud to them. And looking at the state of things, I think it's time we put active effort towards exercising our cognitive abilities. You know, just on the off Time: 11:50 - 12:00 chance the apocalypse arrives, destroys civilization, kills Wikipedia, and sends us back to the stone ages. Time: 12:00 - 12:10 What really separates the intelligence of humans and that of other species is, Time: 12:20 - 12:30 you guessed it, language. Atlantico vocabulary is what helped us communicate the most complex of ideas to each other. You'd be surprised by how ingrained Time: 12:30 - 12:40 language is to our personalities, our culture, and the very fabric of our being. Let me show you. Time: 12:40 - 12:50 All right. All right. All right, everybody. Let's calm down because we are moving on to our next category, which is the German language. Let's look up at computer G. Time: 12:50 - 13:00 So the German word for hand is well hand but the German word for shoe is sure. So Time: 13:00 - 13:10 your question is what is the German word for glove? Option A hand. Time: 13:10 - 13:20 [Music] Option A. Time: 13:20 - 13:30 That is correct. [Music] Time: 13:30 - 13:40 All right, let's settle down because the next one is going to be even harder. Time: 13:40 - 13:50 The German word for cool is cool. The German word for cupboard is shrink. So Time: 13:50 - 14:00 your question is what is the German word for refrigerator? Option A cool shrink. Option B, option A. Option C, option B. Time: 14:00 - 14:10 Option C. Time: 14:10 - 14:20 Ah, you've chosen option C, which is actually option B. And that's option A, which is cool shrank. And that's correct. Time: 14:20 - 14:30 Let's once again take a look at computer G. The German language is famous for their Time: 14:30 - 14:40 compound words which combine two smaller words into new complex terms. It's all very straightforward and logical, isn't it? There's a study called the sapper Time: 14:40 - 14:50 warf hypothesis that suggests that language influences but not determines thought. Going by that, it seems to suggest that the Germans approach to Time: 14:50 - 15:00 their language construction may have had a role to play in their cultures inclination towards logic and precision. But let's look at another language to further explore the hypothesis. Time: 15:00 - 15:10 Okay, now listen carefully because this is the big one. Let's go. What is the direct English translation Time: 15:10 - 15:20 for the Spanish term? And this time you get no options at all. Time: 15:20 - 15:30 I think it's I love you. Time: 15:30 - 15:40 That's actually incorrect. That was actually a trick question. There is no direct translation for tiamo in English. Time: 15:40 - 15:50 That's right. The closest translation for I love you in Spanish is actually historically was always meant to be used as a far Time: 15:50 - 16:00 more intense declaration of love. Whereas if you look at English, we only have I love you. And if you wanted to convey something deeper, we generally just add adjectives and metaphors to it. Time: 16:00 - 16:10 Linguists call this a lexicalization difference. Spanish builds extra rungs into the love ladder so speakers hear and feel finer shades of affection from Time: 16:10 - 16:20 childhood. Maybe that also explains why they are such an emotionally resonant culture. If you want to learn how to make videos like the one you're watching right now, let me give you a glimpse of Time: 16:20 - 16:30 what it takes. Time: 16:30 - 16:40 [Music] Time: 16:40 - 16:50 [Music] Time: 16:50 - 17:00 Are we good to go? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Time: 17:00 - 17:10 [Music] Are we good to go? Time: 17:20 - 17:30 As you saw, it takes an army of people to create and deliver a well-produced video to you guys. And people who can do this are in high demand. With the right Time: 17:30 - 17:40 training, you can turn video making that's from the concept to the final cut into a high income skill with our video mastery program in less than 3 months. Most of the folks you see here are from Time: 17:40 - 17:50 our video editing school. So if you're a student, a job seeker, a content creator, or just somebody who wants to get into the field of video making and video editing, our program is the right Time: 17:50 - 18:00 place for you to start. It will take you from absolute basics and core video editing skills, storytelling, production, motion design, and genai to a hireable editor or video producer. We Time: 18:00 - 18:10 have trained 3,500 students, many of whom are working with some of the top creators and companies. So if you're somebody who wants to learn the skill of video editing, producing videos or are Time: 18:10 - 18:20 just curious about our program, sign up for the free master class that we are hosting. Link is in the description below. See, language shapes the very essence of your being in complex ways. Time: 18:20 - 18:30 So the creation of language requires utmost thought and care. Don't you think? Unfortunately, kids today are forming a whole new dictionary for Time: 18:30 - 18:40 themselves. I say that this goofy air government have been capping. Now I know it's giving to Lulu for this boo. Let's walk in negative Time: 18:40 - 18:50 huru. We've done a whole video on brain rod before but since then this problem has Time: 18:50 - 19:00 quintupled. Sure this new gen language is a fun and creative way to express abstractions but it's a language that is devoid of careful thought and structure that's essential for communication. Take Time: 19:00 - 19:10 the feeling of happiness for example. The words here are each meant to depict a very specific degree of happiness. It allows us to gauge a person's feeling Time: 19:10 - 19:20 based on context. But when it comes to Jendi slang, these words and many more like it that the internet keeps churning out every other week are monotonous and they are replacing and articulate and Time: 19:20 - 19:30 thoughtful vocabulary that we have built over a millennia. Language evolves over time, yes, but there's a growing concern amongst linguists and cognitive Time: 19:30 - 19:40 scientists that this new shift may be eroding a child's ability to communicate complex ideas. We may not be at much risk as we are part of the transition period, but for kids tomorrow, the Time: 19:40 - 19:50 dependence on quick and easy forms of speech could weaken their ability to structure sentences and think critically. I recently read that the Time: 19:50 - 20:00 average Indian spends 5 hours a day on their phone. That's six whole days a month, two and a half months a year, and around 15 years in your lifetime that Time: 20:00 - 20:10 you may end up doom scrolling. Another study claimed that the average person finger climbs the equivalent of Mount Everest every 20 days of scrolling. I'm not sure how to wrap my head around Time: 20:10 - 20:20 that. You know, when your brain receives gratification at a constant rate, it leads to something called anhidonia, the complete absence of enjoyment in your Time: 20:20 - 20:30 pursuits of happiness. These are statistics that indicate our predicament. However, the newest generations will be born into a world where these statistics aren't shocking. Time: 20:30 - 20:40 They will be the baseline, the new normal. The consequences are serious. Children with more than 60 minutes of daily screen time show significantly Time: 20:40 - 20:50 higher signs of ADHD. Even more alarming, early screen exposure disrupts emotional development, dulling their ability to read faces, build empathy, Time: 20:50 - 21:00 and navigate the social world. To make matters worse, there's a notable lack of regulation concerning the design and dissemination of children's digital content, allowing companies to Time: 21:00 - 21:10 prioritize engagement metrics over the well-being of the children. So, what do we do about this? If you're watching this video, you are probably dealing Time: 21:10 - 21:20 with the inability to feel as deeply as you used to. And if you've reached all the way to the end, then you've already taken a huge first step in the road to recovery. See, I don't have all the Time: 21:20 - 21:30 answers, but I can share what's been working for me, and maybe it'll work for you, too. Time: 21:30 - 21:40 To start off, switch your phone's display into grayscale by accessing your developer settings to avoid all those stimulating and triggering colors. You can even add extensions that actively block out brain rod content. Make sure Time: 21:40 - 21:50 you track your screen time religiously and even set app limits. These act as daily reminders that you are crossing the line. Protect your sleep, which is Time: 21:50 - 22:00 where your brain resets itself. This basically prevents the blue light from suppressing your melatonin. Next is dopamine rebalancing. This one's tough, but it works. Set aside 30 minutes where Time: 22:00 - 22:10 you do absolutely nothing stimulating. No phone, no TV, no podcast, no music. And lastly, every night, recount your day and write down one thing you're grateful for. It's basically training Time: 22:10 - 22:20 your brain on a daily basis to notice the silver lining and naturally rebalance your brain chemistry. Look, I know it's not going to be easy to do all this at first, but keep at it. Time: 22:20 - 22:30 Every day it gets easier, but you got to do it every day. That's the hard part. [Music] Time: 22:30 - 22:40The irony is that this video will raise my dopamine baseline for documentaries and explainers",

At a small café, I started\ntalking with a man who seemed to understand things beyond the surface.\nWe spoke about power, influence, and why some people attract wealth and\nsuccess almost effortlessly. Before he left, he handed me a book. The cover\nread The Forbidden Blueprints of Power by Dorian Calden.\nI hesitated to open it for days. Something about it felt heavy, like it held\nsecrets few were meant to know. When I finally did, it wasn’t a typical book\nabout success. It revealed hidden strategies for quietly building wealth,\nprinciples of subtle mind influence, and how certain people draw others in\nnaturally...all based on ancient and hidden laws of power.\nIf you’ve ever felt like there’s a deeper game beneath what everyone sees,\nthis might be the guide to unlocking it.",
