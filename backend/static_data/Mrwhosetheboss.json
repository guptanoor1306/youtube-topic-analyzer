00:20 50,000 ft there's no poles or anything so we can just build sets we can do whatever we want do you know what's blowing my mind this is not what I associate with YouTube you know what's funny that's literally what everyone Time: 00:20 - 00:30 says when they come in here they're like for YouTube one thing I noticed immediately when I walked in is like you clap you hear nothing back yeah except these guys in the background yeah they're working on a video that's Time: 00:30 - 00:40 exactly right so we soundproof the ceiling on top of that uh you'll probably notice there's hundreds of sprinklers on the ceiling do you have sprinklers because you keep blowing stuff up in it yeah exactly no you could Time: 00:40 - 00:50 blow up a car there and not have to worry about burning them the building that's a rare use case scenario in one of our coming up video we need a million dollars these are empty don't try to rob me right now so we're putting $10,000 in 100 briefcases Time: 00:50 - 01:00 is there a reason you've settled on this particular model of briefcase does this just not look like $10,000 I don't know it could be maybe more Time: 01:00 - 01:10 golden okay time to ask Jimmy the big question Android or iPhone obviously iPhone Steve Jobs Steve Jobs name the person who created Android Andy rubben Time: 01:10 - 01:20 okay well I didn't know that we'll keep a tally of every single person we meet in this tour this right here is one of our coming up videos the beauty of having all this space is our old Warehouse was was basically the size of Time: 01:20 - 01:30 this room this room feels like there was some Havoc yeah there was a lot of Havoc it's just like random broken bits of tech and eggs yeah so you should remember that if you show anything bad Time: 01:30 - 01:40 I'm going to get egged that was a threat or you're going to break Tech in front of me yeah yeah I will this was our little Hub over here that you would have thought was baller so this is what it looked like when we were filming so you could see all the girls' cameras there Time: 01:40 - 01:50 all the boys' cameras there so we could constantly monitor it this is the kind of stuff we don't normally show we had to have six or seven people here monitoring every angle because if they just touch the red line they're out you have to basic set up like 40 cameras so Time: 01:50 - 02:00 you can monitor every single inch of the line what they're doing on top of content and there's two of them it's a role you don't think about what did you do today I stared at girls for $100 like Time: 02:00 - 02:10 I would to ref I stared at a red line for $100 someone's getting a little edgy over here yeah and on top of that you can zoom in as well so we have tons of shots but just zooming into their mouths Time: 02:10 - 02:20 or whatever while they're eating food oh my God like what kind of zoom level you want to go to the camera room yeah James he's curious do you use iPhone or Android Apple ooh two to zero two Z Time: 02:20 - 02:30 Steve Jobs wrapped around the studio is tons of office space multiple floors you'll just see like these are some people with planning our next video is that room called Time: 02:30 - 02:40 boots I Didn't Do It All right so this is the camera Room by The yes some videos we use 100 cameras some videos we use 10 some we need to be able to zoom in 100x some we need 100 Vlog cameras Time: 02:40 - 02:50 for hide-and-seek there's a lot of weird things in here you want to summon Tariq I summon him you summon him hey what's up this transition is going to suck this is Tariq he's head of Time: 02:50 - 03:00 camera hello he's going to show us what's going on here I've never seen so much camera gear in my entire life we have 26 FS FS these are the time-lapse cameras that you guys see so every time Time: 03:00 - 03:10 you see a time-lapse shot this camera is usually hanging somewhere on set capturing it okay what just to give you guys an idea the fs5 was a $6,000 camera when it was launched in 2015 these guys Time: 03:10 - 03:20 have 26 of them 5K 26 do the MU yeah there yeah the total is a lot and then you got loads of the same lens so the Time: 03:20 - 03:30 way it works is every single camera lens has a focal length which basically just indicates how zoomed in it is our videos relative to these are very homegrown we film most of them in my bedroom the Time: 03:30 - 03:40 widest angle we have is like 24 mil and the most telescopic one we have is like a 55 mil but these guys when they go wide they go wide this is a 10 mm lens which is used to capture the entirety of Time: 03:40 - 03:50 a massive video set in one shot and then when they want to get closeups from further away they have a lens here capable of not 50 mm or 80 mm but 300 mm Time: 03:50 - 04:00 this is a telescope but there's three more key cameras that the Mr Beast team uses the first being the Sony 4K camcorder so we usually use these for Run and Gun videos SL when we have a lot Time: 04:00 - 04:10 of nighttime shots and that's because it has not just actual night vision but also just insane Optical image stabilization look how much the lens moves on the inside and then to top it all off there's about 50 GoPro cameras Time: 04:10 - 04:20 in these boxes here and another 50 of what are effectively super high-end security cameras each capable of streaming a live view of their feed so that people in that control Center can Time: 04:20 - 04:30 keep an eye on the video contestants in real time oh and also they have 20 times optical zoom and then the piece to resist ons this is an fpv draw that looks like you you've made it we have an fpv pilot you built this he built it Time: 04:30 - 04:40 yeah that's actually wild that something that someone has built themselves is a big part of your filming gear I'm putting you on the spot here can you guess the total value of tech in this room I'm about to be so wrong 1.3 Time: 04:40 - 04:50 million Tariq it's been great thank you so much man oh and thank God I'm back Tariq sucks I won't leave again I kind of missed you Jimmy Time: 04:50 - 05:00 oh my gosh we're missing a lot of our play buttons we do our videos in tons of languages this is just our English channels this is Mr be 6000 so what point did you change it in between 100K and a million apparently but anyways Time: 05:00 - 05:10 this is missing a lot don't look at it it's ugly do you have iPhone or Android I do not which I have Android oh you oh wait so that's one for Android one for Time: 05:10 - 05:20 Android you use iPhone I like to play Both Sides well I guess a point for both it's 2022 and if you're still buying whiteboards you are an idiot there's a thing called whiteboard paint you can just draw wherever it doesn't matter it Time: 05:20 - 05:30 comes off so for us any note that we make we make it a thing to keep it digital you want to keep it online so that anyone can kind of log in and check it do you guys not care about that no no we're wall drawers I grab water Time: 05:30 - 05:40 no he took it anyways this is an enormous screen when we got this place someone was like yeah we got free TVs and that was all I was told I don't Time: 05:40 - 05:50 even shout out to Sony get your marketing Budget on this it turns out Jimmy's free TVs that you find all around this building they're actually Sony's new 85 in 8 K HDR Smart TVs and Time: 05:50 - 06:00 they're being used to watch 1080p content fantastic very comfortable that's an iPad holder yeah but does anyone actually use this you tell me and Time: 06:00 - 06:10 while he's getting comfortable we're going to continue the tour we don't need him what is this for like in the middle of a meeting is someone just going to be like sorry guys hey we're doing a a tour you don't Time: 06:10 - 06:20 mind right it's too comfortable oh no it doesn't work I can't get in were you struggling to get inside that room all you got to do is Time: 06:20 - 06:30 just that it picks up the Bluetooth on my phone and it recognizes it's me so I can unlock the door so yeah this is my little apartment this is where I live for the most part so you actually sleep in your office of Time: 06:30 - 06:40 course this is my bed it looks like my girlfriend left me a message yes if you want to sleep in my bed I won't stop you okay this is nice okay so in Jimmy's Time: 06:40 - 06:50 fridge yogurt and water what we're potentially launching your own sacep cheesburger blur what's on it so they don't get the ingredients the only thing you have to eat them with is yogurt the worst part of my tiny apartment is uh Time: 06:50 - 07:00 the fridge blocks the TV I'm running out of room I missed that this is an enormous screen but it's above the couch so I don't use it these are all my clothes over here bathroom to oh really Time: 07:00 - 07:10 even my bathroom's not off limits bro really we're about to just film in the bathroom together so this is a heated toilet seat I'm telling you it will change your life get a heated toilet Time: 07:10 - 07:20 seat it will make your butt feel great Josh yeah he's getting be roll my toilet this is kind of my morning routine I get out of bed I walk over here work out and then I walk over over here I shower and Time: 07:20 - 07:30 I walk over here I change and then I walk over here and I eat it's like a little morning circuit and then I walk out there and I work and right over here is one of the cool rooms we also have a gaming channel and a React channel which Time: 07:30 - 07:40 we film in here iPhone or Android on three hold up what phone you use oh God three wait you have two you have why Time: 07:40 - 07:50 they're both iPhones let's go never mind good anyways we're actually here to show them the react set so come on in over here so this is where we film all our reacts videos let's react to some tech content let's see it you got to see the Time: 07:50 - 08:00 best tech video of all time like what the hell Josh what's going on here can we go to video two no it just looks like it was rendered weird was this supposed to happen or no what is going on is that Time: 08:00 - 08:10 your cat's bum that's Milo nice to meet you Milo's butthole oh I know this video this is one of my favorite visions of the Future these calendars here oh my gosh and you can walk up to it like that Time: 08:10 - 08:20 so it knows what part of the room you're in I love this idea this digital overlay on the real world I do too honestly I'm kind of pissed off we don't already have this could you see yourself using like all this kind of stuff 100% I mean I Time: 08:20 - 08:30 don't know how to ride a bike so not this I'm just thinking about like Pokémon go too oh all right now we're on to our next clip with Tesla there's no Elon I'm disliking this is some very brave piloting yeah what the hell oh my Time: 08:30 - 08:40 gosh isn't a Tesla the safest car ever made in history remember it survived a crash test and actually broke the crash test dummy do you see Teslas as like an art form I just like obviously that they Time: 08:40 - 08:50 don't run on fossil fuels faster than other cars it has more like amenities but I don't really use any of that the biggest pull to me for a Tesla is the interior like you sit down you feel like you're being lost of course if you're a Time: 08:50 - 09:00 car guy I'm just not who's this guy oh this I need yeah that looks very cool actually you like sushi right I do no screw this Rick Roll I don't care that was actually genius I'm calling someone Time: 09:00 - 09:10 to order him I know you were trying to prank us but I don't care wait I'm buying them hey I need some uh Auto stick Chopsticks love you Time: 09:10 - 09:20 you don't probably get much experience with Android FS never this is the xiaomi 12s Ultra one of its big selling points is the fact that it has the biggest camera sensor and a phone wow this is cool yeah this is crazy love Time: 09:20 - 09:30 it yeah the coloring is good look at that tell me that doesn't look like a wallpaper I can't say it's better but I can tell you it's not work it's an interesting takee cuz normally iPhone users just kind of shut down Android Time: 09:30 - 09:40 phones and for coming out to Beast react Studio you get a giant water money here you go thanks for coming out all right let's continue the tour Android or iPhone Android yes Time: 09:40 - 09:50 Android two more Android points I hate you guys and this room over here I think you guys will enjoy so it's top secret but I you right in the back corner of Time: 09:50 - 10:00 the building of all the rooms in the building I feel like you would appreciate this the most all right so this is the Mr be server room the way these guys have set it up is that all the projects that they're ever working on are stored right here on site in This Time: 10:00 - 10:10 Server which means that every single computer in this entire complex is accessing the same set of files at the same time but the cherry on top is that it's configured so that even if you're Time: 10:10 - 10:20 sitting on the other side of the world you can actually remotely log in and access the editing machines here to use them to edit footage that's stored right here in this server so how much stor storage would you say you have in this Time: 10:20 - 10:30 room infinite infinite what do you think the total cost of this room is 400 Grand do you use Android or iPhone you play chess I do play chess on to give a chess Time: 10:30 - 10:40 now over the few days that I spent with Jimmy the one key thing that I've learned about this guy is he takes board games seriously he absolutely caned me in a game of Katan the night before chess was my way of making sure I won Time: 10:40 - 10:50 one back oh my God that was a good all right so this is the editing room and I had two things that I wanted to find out here one how is Mr Beast Time: 10:50 - 11:00 internet oh I see you get what I mean yeah yeah that's what there you go right there what the upload that's you know with footage finding and stuff how and Time: 11:00 - 11:10 two if these guys have any special gear to edit with yeah they kind of do the editors who prefer windows they're each using $119,000 HP workstations with 24 Time: 11:10 - 11:20 core server grade processors and 256 GB of RAM and for those who prefer Mac a pretty equivalently specs $21,000 Mac Pro wait how much they cost yeah Jimmy Time: 11:20 - 11:30 didn't even know how much they feels like we've been in a lot of rooms but this is only part of it there's so many rooms in this building and it's so massive that's what I love about it I feel like I'm getting my steps in and Time: 11:30 - 11:40 over here is the Little Kitchen there's Feast table bars over here you should be eating these it's a very colorful selection of beverages you've never seen unicorn magic honeydew soda it was in Time: 11:40 - 11:50 there cuz it was a punishment for a video we don't obviously drink this it's actually really nice yeah so much sugar that I'm literally tearing up so I have't added in question for you actually you've got the most ridiculous Time: 11:50 - 12:00 camera gear available to you you've got 300 cameras in some videos you just upgraded your cameras actually to new ones that can shoot 8K resolution which I never will cuz I think it looks too professional yeah so this is the Time: 12:00 - 12:10 question why is it that after all that you still export in 1080P I don't like the way high quality footage looks you know at the end of the day it's just me and the boys messing around you know we still come up with the videos it's still Time: 12:10 - 12:20 things that I find fun and I enjoy and I don't ever want things to feel too produced why do you do 8K we do 4K to some extent in the tech genre there's like an expectation that you have good Time: 12:20 - 12:30 production value if I can't take good footage who am I to judge other phones for how good they this is in 4k okay but there's a Twist here you've come here thinking that Jimmy has just one Studio Time: 12:30 - 12:40 he actually has two we've just seen what they called Studio C okay and this is Studio A this is where it all began this is also where I've heard a lot of Mr Beast secrets are and this is Walt hi Time: 12:40 - 12:50 I'm Walt I'm the head of on-site production for Mr Beast gaming and Mr Beast reacts there's a whole bunch of Lights here what lights does Mr Beast use for his videos they're called Sky panels every single one is a $7,000 Time: 12:50 - 13:00 fixture capable of lighting an entire Warehouse on its own I want to say that's like at least 10 12 kilos probably damn now because Studio C is becoming Time: 13:00 - 13:10 the main office that everyone works out of Studio A is the one where you find the most exotic items I'm talking like a mini driveable Lamborghini giant fake marshmallows from when they tried to recreate Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory Time: 13:10 - 13:20 and then tubs upon tubs of costumes that they used in their Recreation of the squid games so this is the gaming trailer oh yeah iPhone or Android I'm iPhone I got a 12 Pro Max this cabin Time: 13:20 - 13:30 which is a part of Studio A is where the entirety of the Mr Beast gaming channel is filmed and it's kind of nerd Paradise there's shelves upon shelves of Time: 13:30 - 13:40 wonderful and questionable Tech items there's a real ice cream machine and there's Nerf guns everywhere but then we go deeper inside so this is the office where I kind of currently work out of is Time: 13:40 - 13:50 this what I think it is yeah was the Retro future the custom made original Game Boy wow the logo the sesame seeds the pink po Buton you can change the Time: 13:50 - 14:00 color on the screen it has that authentic bit wild you can't beat weirdly that's one of the coolest pieces of tech I've seen so far here we have Jimmy's gaming room oh damn the main Time: 14:00 - 14:10 idea with these setups is that they could sit down and then be good to go filming within a minute or two I'm going to sit down and I'm going to rate Mr BEAST's gaming setup oh good choice of chair you can Time: 14:10 - 14:20 tell that the entire setup here is just geared around efficiency they've got it to the point that with one tap of this button here all lights can be turned on and off and with top of this button all Time: 14:20 - 14:30 the relevant programs that they need to film one of these gaming videos they are loaded and ready in one Go including the software to be able to see your own camera view in real time the mouse is really smooth this is the most Time: 14:30 - 14:40 responsive Windows Experience I've ever had the keyboard is a membrane keyboard which is normally considered like a tier below but you've done that for noise reasons intentionally and so given that it's actually it's actually really nice Time: 14:40 - 14:50 to tyon it doesn't feel bad the keys have nice travel he's done a definite solid with this controller this is my favorite looking Xbox controller ever the Chrome outlines around each button are nice this is a very b a choice of mic and if you're wondering what the PC Time: 14:50 - 15:00 is that Mr Beast uses for gaming with an I9 11900 K 32 gigs of RAM and an RTX 3090 graphics card hooked up to a 4K 120 Time: 15:00 - 15:10 HZ monitor this whole setup would be around $115,000 but that's not the crazy part because there isn't just one of them the entire room has actually been almost 100% cloned four times one for Time: 15:10 - 15:20 each of the characters in Jimmy's videos Chandler Carl and Chris they all have slightly different chairs and keyboards based on their preferences but the core machine behind it are one to one so this Time: 15:20 - 15:30 is the storage warehouse this is the storage Warehouse I've been told this is the weirdest place of the allall you need giant 40in touchscreen iPhones got Time: 15:30 - 15:40 those yeah so as you can tell I'm very heavily on the team iPhone so this giant iPhone it's essentially a real iPhone 6s that's casting its screen to an Apple TV box screwed into the back that's hooked Time: 15:40 - 15:50 up to a large TV screen it sounds ridiculous but it works this is wild this is like the one part of it that I I wouldn't have thought works yeah I could Time: 15:50 - 16:00 take a portrait mode all right let's do that yeah I got you I got you I got you there we go there you go left my mark this Storage Center is just rammed with Time: 16:00 - 16:10 all the stuff that's been used in past videos that might need to be used in future videos literally anything you can think of tiki torches Rubber Chickens an even bigger Nano Leaf light collection than we have even a box full of Time: 16:10 - 16:20 shockingly realistic babies don't ask me why it's here pretty much all the expensive stuff lies within here as far as like phones to give away way it's always Time: 16:20 - 16:30 Apple I think you just broken our scale a little bit I'm sorry and to wrap up the studio tour I wanted to show him something cool so walk with me boys oh there's a plant there we're doing a Time: 16:30 - 16:40 video where I put a guy inside of this red circle see the outline around the house and if he survives in there for a 100 days straight he wins half a million dollars Okay so we've seen Studio C we've seen Studio A we've seen whatever Time: 16:40 - 16:50 this is we've got the full price of all the tech inside what is the actual cost of the buildings themselves oh boy the big Studio over there was a little over $10 million the old one actually was a Time: 16:50 - 17:00 church that we renovated that was like probably 1.3 million so okay $1.3 million in buildings yeah everything I don't even want to know the total you Time: 17:00 - 17:10 know what I just make the best videos possible and sometimes I have to spend money and if you enjoyed this video then a sub to the channel would be he told me say beastly you might have noticed over the Time: 17:10 - 17:20 last few months that the entire way that I'm trying to make my videos is changing the way I now spend much more time moving between locations and being out and about the way I'm trying to get more interactions with YouTube friends and Time: 17:20 - 17:30 members of the public and how I'm trying to have a clear golden moment in every video a a culmination of everything that rewards you the viewer for clicking a lot of this stuff has come from the Time: 17:30 - 17:40 storytelling through film course that I found on skillshare by a guy called Thomas deare and the thing that really struck me about this is how efficiently you can learn stuff on this platform there's no clickbait there's no ads and Time: 17:40 - 17:50 it's organized in such a way that you can pick up any new skill in practically any category from animation to marketing start to finish in 30 minutes the first thousand of you to sign up using my code Time: 17:50 - 18:00 or the link in the description will get a 1-month free trial of skillshare to get started on that Journey Time: 18:00 - 18:10 I’ve never shown the behind the scenes of my baby like this before, hope you all enjoy! All I want in life is to make the best YouTube videos possible :)",

00:30 here that'll be interesting so this one describes itself as small tied beauty strong performance i feel very very reassured oh they've got a rugged mini phone Time: 00:30 - 00:40 that's curious oh we've got an iphone like notch up top here whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa that's tiny okay i think it's one of those we'll Time: 00:40 - 00:50 believe it when we see it type things really you do wonder would a phone this small actually function like a bigger one like something's got to give right the Time: 00:50 - 01:00 king kong mini 2 i feel like king kong is the worst possible name what if we search for a mini speaker that's pretty small i think we can do better okay that's Time: 01:00 - 01:10 small that is very small is that going to sound better than your phone speakers tiniest drone that is tiny that's like that's like this big it says that has a 4k camera in it Time: 01:10 - 01:20 they have spelled the word camera wrong hmm let's try a mini camera oh these are all spy cameras they've got a Time: 01:20 - 01:30 1080p hidden camera inside a die i don't want to try it but that's weird i just wanted like a little dslr i was thinking like how small can Time: 01:30 - 01:40 we go no way that fits on a keychain i guess i shouldn't be that surprised you know we've got tiny cameras on our phones as well but just seeing this as like a standalone Time: 01:40 - 01:50 camera pretty cool this one's just adorable i feel like we've got to try this as well okay mini macbook i don't know what i'm hoping for here to be honest oh okay i want to find like a tiny Time: 01:50 - 02:00 laptop all right that passes the small test i think let's give that a go oh what about a mini car that's just going to be a toy car Time: 02:00 - 02:10 isn't it the smallest mouse oh we can go for world's thinnest mouse that'll do us just fine that's so Time: 02:10 - 02:20 tiny oh that is exactly what we need let's do it mini flashlight oh there's some very bold claims about the brightness here that looks Time: 02:20 - 02:30 ridiculous okay um we have one here it's not a mini flashlight but this is claiming to be 9 billion lumens so we can either get 9 Time: 02:30 - 02:40 million lumens or we can get 9 billion lumens for an extra 10 pound anyways anyways Time: 02:40 - 02:50 okay so this is a mini projector that fits in your hand and can apparently create a 100 inch display what about mini power bank 10 000 milliamp hours Time: 02:50 - 03:00 that's not 10 000 behave so we've got one here that's made to look like a little fuel canister and it's so small you can carry it on your keys oh we've got to get a mini fridge of Time: 03:00 - 03:10 course mini fridge that is perfect mini fan [Music] Time: 03:10 - 03:20 that doesn't look fun at all there's got to be a better way of doing it than that i wonder how small a phone could go if it doesn't have to be a smartphone Time: 03:20 - 03:30 what is that oh my god the zanko beetle well we've got a mini flip phone here that said tree that's half the size of their finger 70 but this is claiming to be the Time: 03:30 - 03:40 world's smallest phone so we've got to get that one that's a no-brainer the very last thing i just want to check is how small can we go if we don't even Time: 03:40 - 03:50 need to make a phone that turns on wow that's unbelievable someone's made like actual mini mini iphones and Time: 03:50 - 04:00 there's like a full-on unboxing experience for them as well that's incredible that's so small what if we just go miniature ps5 they actually have one Time: 04:00 - 04:10 that is everything i wanted from this video and more right i've got to stop before i end up actually buying a dollhouse okay let's fast forward a month when Time: 04:10 - 04:20 hopefully all this stuff has arrived it didn't all arrive but i think i slightly underestimated how many things Time: 04:20 - 04:30 i ordered so thanks to surfsharkvpn for making that possible and let's do it from small to tiny to miniature right let's start with the fridge Time: 04:30 - 04:40 oh it feels extremely cheap and cheerful all right let's power this bad boy up it doesn't exactly inspire confidence but let's test it so because i'm Time: 04:40 - 04:50 british there's a cup of tea i made earlier so you can see right now the temperature is hovering at about 65 degrees celsius so let's get it in Time: 04:50 - 05:00 close it up and come back to it at the end and see what temperature it can call it to this one has me weirdly excited i'm not the kind of person who gets Time: 05:00 - 05:10 excited about vacuum cleaners but look at it yeah that's adorable this is the hose on the inside more complex than it needs to be does it Time: 05:10 - 05:20 seem right okay batteries in oh ow the proper solid job this Time: 05:20 - 05:30 okay so we brought up some flour from downstairs we're just gonna on the table on the table all right let's do it Time: 05:30 - 05:40 it does actually work to be fair not what i was expecting i'm ready to go Time: 05:40 - 05:50 but i do feel a bit like a short crust pastry okay so this is the i think it's the world's smallest laptop that is very very small oh it's got the Time: 05:50 - 06:00 little pads on the bottom this feels like it's designed like a macbook really really curious like what would it be like to use this as Time: 06:00 - 06:10 your main machine the fans have a kick to be fair it sounds a lot like my macbook too i'm just showing milo some cat videos he's a fan it's not the fastest machine but there Time: 06:10 - 06:20 is something novel about having a full windows operating system on something that's a quarter of the size of a normal laptop i love this little trackpad that's such good engineering i think he Time: 06:20 - 06:30 wants one can have my computer back hello he's like why are you taking it away from me it's like it's little brother okay so this is i mean according to Time: 06:30 - 06:40 where i bought it apparently the power of the sun this one's almost the same design just shrunk down this one is adorable Time: 06:40 - 06:50 look at it all right this is the smallest flashlight this is what it can apparently do let's test it you can just about tell it's on my Time: 06:50 - 07:00 disappointment is immeasurable and this is the biggest nine billion lumens here we go oh oh Time: 07:00 - 07:10 that's not bad ah this is our bladeless neck holder looks so ridiculous oh i kind of like it Time: 07:10 - 07:20 it's pretty much just cooling my neck so my head is like this temperature my neck is here it's also quite comforting like it it feels like someone's giving you a hug Time: 07:20 - 07:30 oh and you can turn it up it's nearly macbook levels this is very exciting Time: 07:30 - 07:40 i don't know if it's the world's smallest but it's one of the world's smallest projectors and that is literally it how do we test a projector here you might ask Time: 07:40 - 07:50 well we've got a nintendo switch a hdmi cable and the secret ingredient Time: 07:50 - 08:00 i thought it was going to be faster than that i think we have we have power it does work not the Time: 08:00 - 08:10 brightest or highest resolution but for the size not bad videos look good Time: 08:10 - 08:20 we've got one set of earphones that was stickier than i would have hoped and these are actually a pair of earphones that do not exist in real life Time: 08:20 - 08:30 they're the beats tws3 wireless it's actually really nice packaging but um i wonder how the everything about this just just poor Time: 08:30 - 08:40 on the bright side you do have an led in the earphones and the case does tell you the battery percentage which is falling every time i look at it Time: 08:40 - 08:50 but yeah this is this is probably the most budget true wireless earphone experience i've ever had yeah one of them doesn't work oh Time: 08:50 - 09:00 let's check on the tee from earlier these cats okay now we've got the phones we've got a lot of phones so instead of Time: 09:00 - 09:10 watching me unbox 15 products back to back let's do them all at once Time: 09:10 - 09:20 guys this is incredible Time: 09:20 - 09:30 you know what the best part is is that for once on these types of videos i don't feel like i've been lied to by the photos these are genuinely tiny let's get them in size Time: 09:30 - 09:40 order and then see which ones we like so this is our luxury mini phone and i'm kind of surprised how much i like it because it's so so thin and it's got this leather-like Time: 09:40 - 09:50 material on the back it's crazy comfortable like i'm just not used to phones that are this usable with one hand my thumb could probably stretch across two of these seven out of ten Time: 09:50 - 10:00 and now we've got a little bit of like a like a chubby iphone 10. to be honest though apart from that camera layout it's very very standard the camera for some reason it just has Time: 10:00 - 10:10 the text megapixel so i guess we can assume it has one feels like a four out of ten hmm Time: 10:10 - 10:20 this one's surprisingly good i like the way it looks and the screen is bright it kind of looks a lot like an oled screen which means the blacks are dark enough that it hides the border also it's actually just pretty smooth Time: 10:20 - 10:30 eight out of ten okay yet another iphone clone oh oh okay so we've got a white iphone style bezel Time: 10:30 - 10:40 but then inside it you've got another set of bezels basically one could say we have an iphone on our hands and why do companies feel the need to put text Time: 10:40 - 10:50 like that on the back i'd give this one a five okay i'm particularly excited about this one because this one is inspired by huawei's porsche design limited edition phones they're Time: 10:50 - 11:00 like two and a half grand and i do get the impression of quality here like this one feels in particular very firmly constructed and i like the contrast between the plastic rails Time: 11:00 - 11:10 and the glossy buttons it's like a weird level of attention to detail for something as cheap and cheerful as this let's try the camera probably going to be disappointed aren't i oh no it's so bad we got to do me like Time: 11:10 - 11:20 that 7 out of 10. um i kind of hate this one it's trying to look like an iphone right it's got the Time: 11:20 - 11:30 iphone camera the iphone flash it's even got a knot on the front but it's a keypad phone it's a non-smart brick phone that's just trying to jump on the bandwagon Time: 11:30 - 11:40 and it doesn't really pull it off three out of ten so this one is uh iphone number two i actually like the way it looks from the back that white and silver combo Time: 11:40 - 11:50 that is one of the colors on the iphone 10 and it doesn't look far off but i think the front is even worse than the other one pretty smooth phone though all things considered and the home button does work Time: 11:50 - 12:00 well so six out of ten ah tough to know what to think about this one because on one hand if i'm just holding this on my hand and you take a cursory Time: 12:00 - 12:10 glance at it you might for a second think oh my god he's got an iphone 11 pro but it's a third of the size that it should be in which case it has achieved its goal Time: 12:10 - 12:20 but i mean just look at the front it's not very pretty is it i think my calculator has prettier buttons hmm this one's pretty interesting so it Time: 12:20 - 12:30 kind of reminds me of the iphones we had earlier like this one but they've obviously trimmed some sort of corner to make it even smaller and they've definitely made some sort of Time: 12:30 - 12:40 compromise to the screen because the colors and the contrast here they're not even close still though there is some part of me that's just impressed that like this is full android like look how tiny Time: 12:40 - 12:50 some of these icons are how often do you see that okay but now we are going down a serious step in size this is oh my god look at it it's got more bezel than screen it Time: 12:50 - 13:00 sounds like me when i used to play the recorder so this is not running a full smartphone operating system it's it's more like a smartwatch operating Time: 13:00 - 13:10 system but it is still touchscreen and do you know what the really impressive part is has a headphone jack and it also has a camera although as with most of these things i Time: 13:10 - 13:20 can't vouch for how that looks it feels like there's a certain size beyond which you start to make some major major compromises but this is a really interesting case study because this one is a phone that isn't Time: 13:20 - 13:30 trying to be like a big phone that's then shrunk down this was made to be the world's smallest 3g phone pretty sure i paid like 60 70 for this which for a non-smartphone is Time: 13:30 - 13:40 it's crazy pricing the screen is very bright and i like the fact that the buttons are backlit and it is kind of crazy that this has internet Time: 13:40 - 13:50 too small too small but with a keypad this small it's gonna take me five minutes per word just to type out a search and then i've got the smallest one of the bunch a flip phone Time: 13:50 - 14:00 would you look at that this is actually not bad i mean my thumb does cover the entire keypad in the front but the screen looks decent and it does Time: 14:00 - 14:10 have a much more normal functional phone interface and the best part of a flippy phone wait for it Time: 14:10 - 14:20 now they're getting even smaller and i know this video is about the smallest tech in the world but if you are enjoying it then a sub to the Time: 14:20 - 14:30 channel would be herculean oh uh so this isn't a mini phone but while i was browsing wish.com Time: 14:30 - 14:40 i found apparently an iphone like a real iphone for one dollar so we'll see it does look a lot like a real-life fan feels a lot like a real iphone Time: 14:40 - 14:50 oh my god no this is a fully working iphone okay if someone on wish.com is watching Time: 14:50 - 15:00 this please explain to me what what is the business model here it's like the strangest mix of a a scam and a charity at the same time ah i think these are our two mice Time: 15:00 - 15:10 why is this one packaged like my mum's curtains so this one is meant to be the slimmest mouse in the world Time: 15:10 - 15:20 no way you unwind it okay just feels weird like i'm kind of used to having something i can wrap my hands around it it just feels like i'm pushing something along a table here you've got Time: 15:20 - 15:30 a virtual scroll wheel in the middle they're saying that Time: 15:30 - 15:40 but there's more i don't know why this just reminds me of like a block of cheese so this one's a wireless one so you get a wireless receiver oh that's it it Time: 15:40 - 15:50 works oh that's way better there's something very nice as well about having a a three- dimensional object to grip onto as well as an actual physical scroll wheel much Time: 15:50 - 16:00 better getting to the really small ones now so this is meant to be world's smallest tv oh dear Time: 16:00 - 16:10 what have i got myself into so this right here is the speaker this is the battery this is the remote control it's so tiny put the circuit board inside yeah okay i can build oh Time: 16:10 - 16:20 look at that can i change program oh my god so strange this is like Time: 16:20 - 16:30 russian propaganda oh i built it okay i've got that speaker Time: 16:30 - 16:40 i'm pretty sure that's not what i ordered you take what we get it's very small now we need to find a phone with a headphone jack lg to the rescue some of the few modern Time: 16:40 - 16:50 phones that do have headphone jacks even if they are now out of business okay three two one Time: 16:50 - 17:00 [Music] that's pretty impressive i like that Time: 17:00 - 17:10 okay mysterious pile of bubble wrap ah this is our camera it does feel a lot more like a toy than i remember Time: 17:10 - 17:20 turns on do you know what though it functions a lot like an actual camera you've got a settings menu here the video is apparently 1080p and for those of you who are wondering Time: 17:20 - 17:30 this is what that looks like i'm not hugely excited about the quality here but i'm willing to forgive a lot for the price that i paid for this i feel like now we're approaching miniature Time: 17:30 - 17:40 territory so this is the controller for what i'm assuming yep is the drone okay i am 99 sure that this doesn't actually have an sd card slot Time: 17:40 - 17:50 and therefore that this isn't actually a real camera which means that i've been lied to Time: 17:50 - 18:00 [Music] okay we've set up a bubble wrap finish line i'm gonna try and drive it straight Time: 18:00 - 18:10 through and just see what happens oh my god oh my god i've got i've got a surprising amount of control over this okay let's go let's go oh oh Time: 18:10 - 18:20 oh no okay bring it back and bring it back in there that's me that's me oh no Time: 18:20 - 18:30 that was so close that could have been uh apple pro display xdr down the drain and this is our miniature power bank Time: 18:30 - 18:40 oh my god look at it so that's the micro usb cable it's built inside of it what else do you do with the power bank Time: 18:40 - 18:50 very very excited about this one this is pocket sprite Time: 18:50 - 19:00 and this is one of the world's smallest game consoles no way that's beautiful Time: 19:00 - 19:10 it's absolutely minuscule but it kind of works i guess because there's just not that many buttons on it but like just for some perspective Time: 19:10 - 19:20 game boy pocket sprite i always wanted a transparent game boy when i was younger i just thought it was like the coolest thing and i'm trying to think what my reaction Time: 19:20 - 19:30 would have been if someone had rocked up to me then and handed me this and finally are the miniatures so i believe this Time: 19:30 - 19:40 must be our ps5 i know it's not going to do anything but i'm i'm strangely excited about this look at that that's amazing Time: 19:40 - 19:50 and it actually feels like i don't know what it's made of but it's proper high quality and you can also see every single port on the back of it ps5 Time: 19:50 - 20:00 mini ps5 and then we have ipad pro and iphone 12 pro max Time: 20:00 - 20:10 mini mini mini mini mini it's just crazy i don't know why i'm impressed i mean it's just a piece of plastic with a screen taped on top Time: 20:10 - 20:20 but i'm just not used to seeing tablets of this dimension and then our iphone what is this unboxing experience that's the iphone let me try and get Time: 20:20 - 20:30 closer it's like a tic tac you could probably swallow this and you wouldn't even notice all right the moment you've all been waiting for Time: 20:30 - 20:40 the big reveal of what temperature my tears now oh it feels cold we've got our temperature sensor here come round so it is Time: 20:40 - 20:50 18 degrees celsius two degrees below room temperature we've been filming for four hours okay Time: 20:50 - 21:00 never mind does anyone want a fridge okay here's something to think about for a second your location your operating system every hardware detail of the device you're on right now as well as all your past browsing Time: 21:00 - 21:10 history these are things that you'd want to keep to yourself right well this is how much information a website immediately knows about you the second you click on it and to be honest if it's a website you Time: 21:10 - 21:20 trust then it's fine but i'm willing to bet that there's a lot you visit that you probably don't and that's where surfsharkvpn comes in as far as i've seen it's the most Time: 21:20 - 21:30 affordable way to keep yourself anonymous it's just over two dollars a month for as many people and as many devices as you want but there's another perk because i can effectively pick the location that i want my device to be from Time: 21:30 - 21:40 i can for example pick the united states and watch us tv shows you can effectively have the exclusives for every single region without leaving your home like if i Time: 21:40 - 21:50 wanted to watch batman the dark knight i just switched to canada and i can do that so check the link in the description and if you use the code boss you get an 83 discount Time: 21:50 - 22:00 and an extra three months for free if you enjoyed this video then here's an instagram story that completely crashes your phone you might find that interesting and for the best smartphones of 2021 click here Time: 22:00 - 22:10 and where's that henry Time: 22:10 - 22:20This man is such a legend, he managed to Rick Roll us on the world's smallest projector",

00:30 yes i'm sure okay you have to buy the pen separately 129. the the cover is 119. oh you cheeky little did Time: 00:30 - 00:40 that actually just become 700. i feel like i've just been robbed anyways let's find a charger for it well would you look at that the size of a credit card Time: 00:40 - 00:50 you will do just fine hmm slimmest earphones in the world the slimmest printer in the world so one of the things that i normally try and do when i'm ordering stuff is to see if i can Time: 00:50 - 01:00 build a computer setup in the theme of that video so world's thinnest mouse check we've got a mouse mat fractions of a Time: 01:00 - 01:10 millimeter thick check what about the keyboard though it's pretty thin i'm sure we can do better though oh logitech that's very thin it's just it's Time: 01:10 - 01:20 just the keys if only you could have a keyboard without the key sticking out okay um that's probably going to do the job this Time: 01:20 - 01:30 is a keyboard made completely of glass but of course for a computer setup we need a computer so we could get like a really high-end gaming pc but built into Time: 01:30 - 01:40 a really thin case like this um well this is the coolest pc case i've ever seen in my life we could get one of those really mini pcs um Time: 01:40 - 01:50 no no okay this has got to be special let's get something custom made this is not gonna be cheap speaking of computers though i've wanted Time: 01:50 - 02:00 a good windows laptop for a really long time now let's see dell xps 15 which is 17 millimeters thick that's less than two centimeters Time: 02:00 - 02:10 there's the razor book which is actually 15 millimeters i think we got our answer the acer swift 7 is 9.95 millimeters thick Time: 02:10 - 02:20 less than a centimeter oh my god i'm looking at the thinnest screen i've ever seen i'm just gonna buy it i'm not even gonna show you yet this is gonna be Time: 02:20 - 02:30 worth the wait okay what kind of stuff do i just wish was thinner a suitcase why not the narrowest sunglasses ever the skinniest wallet ever Time: 02:30 - 02:40 i'm so confused like how does that even hold anything and then finally to finish off the budget i want to see if we can find a speaker now this might be a bit Time: 02:40 - 02:50 of a challenge because you'd normally need to make speakers chunky so that they can get enough bikes i like the battery bike wait that's a speaker ah it's not for sale Time: 02:50 - 03:00 how convenient so i think this is the slimmest speaker that you can buy it's apparently as thin as your phone and this is even thinner because it's not actually a speaker in itself but it can Time: 03:00 - 03:10 turn anything you stick it onto into a speaker okay someone take this laptop away from me right two months later and it's time to unbox it all so Time: 03:10 - 03:20 let's start thin and just keep getting thinner i mean all you've got to do is to look at this packaging to realize just how thin things are going to get okay so starting at nine centimeters you know that custom pc i was talking about Time: 03:20 - 03:30 we got it and you're actually looking at it right now so basically i found this company called novatech and they have a sub brand called rain gaming which has some Time: 03:30 - 03:40 of the coolest custom pcs i've ever seen so i told them i'm looking for the thinnest extreme pc on the market and from there we came up with the idea of building it into my desk now i'll admit Time: 03:40 - 03:50 this is still not the most razor thin pc you've ever seen we could have made it thinner but wait till you see what it can do i mean just for starters mechanical legs so Time: 03:50 - 04:00 with one tap of a button this can go from below my waist to above my head mr who's the boss themed colors across all cabling and lighting electrochromic glass such that if all that color Time: 04:00 - 04:10 becomes a distraction i can just tap one button and bam it'll pass a specialized current through it which changes the chemical arrangement of that glass to make it opaque but on top of all of that Time: 04:10 - 04:20 power we're talking a 12th gen intel i7 12700 kf processor nvidia geforce rdx 3080 ti graphics card and wd black sm850 Time: 04:20 - 04:30 storage which is so fast it can copy an entire one terabyte hard drive across in just three minutes we'll keep adding things to this pc setup as we go through Time: 04:30 - 04:40 the video and unbox thinner and thinner devices okay dropping all the way down to just five centimeters we have a rolling suitcase and you're probably thinking Time: 04:40 - 04:50 five centimeters i couldn't even fit my underwear in that but it expands it seems like a very solid piece of kit Time: 04:50 - 05:00 this feels wrong it's not a suitcase surely i love the concept of this it only ever Time: 05:00 - 05:10 takes up as much space as it needs to now at half the thickness of even that we're only three products in and already reaching 2.5 centimeters hp's sprocket Time: 05:10 - 05:20 this is a printer that's just ridiculous so in theory i should just be able to pull up a photo on my phone oh Time: 05:20 - 05:30 something's happening it's really fast and the picture goes right up to the edges i'm quite impressed pretty high resolution but if you think that's thin Time: 05:30 - 05:40 okay just for perspective here's a pair of apple airpods pretty thin credit where do but nothing compared to this monstrosity inside this pack should be the yobyo card 20 earphones Time: 05:40 - 05:50 oh look what they're called card because they're so slim that it's it's not just that they'll fit in your pocket these could Time: 05:50 - 06:00 fit in your wallet i wonder if they've just given them like no battery life now i honestly have zero idea what to expect from this one it genuinely looks like someone's taken a proper camera and Time: 06:00 - 06:10 then just sat on it repeatedly to flatten it it's quite a strange product like it does actually feel quite solid and well made but then to look at it's more like a middle school origami Time: 06:10 - 06:20 project but then it is actually a proper digital camera with real interchangeable lenses so let's stick our sd card in here we've got a slider to select from a bunch of different filters one thing's Time: 06:20 - 06:30 for absolutely sure though these photos are an entire mood it's got a really old-school quirky style to it you know i would genuinely say that Time: 06:30 - 06:40 testing new speakers is one of my favorite things ever to do and that pleasure is never greater than when you're testing a record-breaking one this lenovo 700 is just 1.1 centimeter Time: 06:40 - 06:50 thick Time: 06:50 - 07:00 that is unbelievable how is that going to sound because normally for proper bass you need physical depth for the speaker to be Time: 07:00 - 07:10 able to like push air i think this is smaller than my phone the speaker's so thin the sound is so fat especially when you factor in that they've also apparently squeezed an Time: 07:10 - 07:20 eight hour battery life into this oh but we can actually get even thinner audio and to get this thin we're having to use a completely different technology this is blade Time: 07:20 - 07:30 it's not a speaker and of itself but you can place blade onto anything and i mean anything to turn that device into a speaker it sounds like science fiction instead of turning your music into a Time: 07:30 - 07:40 sound wave directly it's instead converting it into a mechanical vibration that can use the space inside another object as a sound chamber to induce that sound wave from it instead Time: 07:40 - 07:50 okay so you can kind of hear the vibration already right [Applause] it's like magic oh my god Time: 07:50 - 08:00 i can feel the bass through this cardboard box the bass i'm getting while it's sitting on this pc is insane okay we're about to break the one Time: 08:00 - 08:10 centimeter mark and i still can't quite believe that the product we're doing that with is a laptop this is the record-breaking acer swift seven apparently made possible through a razor Time: 08:10 - 08:20 thin magnesium aluminium alloy material and also presumably a severe trimming of the speakers and battery no it barely feels heavier than my ipad i Time: 08:20 - 08:30 feel like the hardest thing to complement here is the fact that this is two layers this is a screen a keyboard ports it's everything it genuinely feels like i'm using a dummy unit that doesn't Time: 08:30 - 08:40 actually function let's try watching a quick video the screen is a bit dim though and the speakers are oh yeah oh god moving on okay time to completely switch tact Time: 08:40 - 08:50 coming in at 0.9 centimeters thick these are the rove sunglasses slightly cheap packaging but we'll look past it and there it is Time: 08:50 - 09:00 i feel like i need to stress this 0.9 centimeters is how thick they are when folded if i unfold them with one two three four five Time: 09:00 - 09:10 six oh seven this is so thin i feel like i could slice something with it fruit me just for Time: 09:10 - 09:20 science oh we're in [Music] no way i didn't think i'd be doing this today Time: 09:20 - 09:30 now sweeping in at just 0.8 centimeters we have that keyboard which is effectively just a sheet of glass with touch sensors on it doesn't sound the most appealing to use like the reason Time: 09:30 - 09:40 that normal keyboards are comfortable is that the keys will travel as you press them in this one doesn't have that and what is that font i can't complain too Time: 09:40 - 09:50 much though it's extremely thin and the core concept of this design is straight out of a sci-fi film plus if i turn it on here it also has leds baked in yeah Time: 09:50 - 10:00 this ain't the best kind of crazy though is that even thinner than that sheet of glass there is a company called espresso who's managed to build a fully working display Time: 10:00 - 10:10 it's not the highest spec screen out there it's a 1080p lcd but still the dimensions are shocking and it feels quality this is an aluminium and glass Time: 10:10 - 10:20 shell it reminds me a lot of an ipad in terms of design let's come back to that when we have all the pieces of this setup okay not so fun fact about me for quite Time: 10:20 - 10:30 a while now i have struggled with falling asleep i think my brain is so used to just constantly churning out video ideas that it doesn't know how to shut off anymore well these earbuds Time: 10:30 - 10:40 called the cocoon night buds are designed to solve that problem they're pretty funky looking but that's because of this hub in the middle here which is packed with sensors that we'll be able Time: 10:40 - 10:50 to detect when you've fallen asleep so you no longer need to keep setting these sleep timers for your content these earphones will automatically fade out your music the minute you no longer need Time: 10:50 - 11:00 it but that's not even the coolest bit they can also track your sleep quality and help you understand it they can detect snoring and mask the noise from it and they're so thin from every angle a Time: 11:00 - 11:10 quarter of the thickness of normal bluetooth buds for such that it doesn't really matter what position you're lying down in you can't really feel them they just they feel like an extension of your Time: 11:10 - 11:20 head based on a quick first impression i am a big fan of this and the sound quality is not the best but pretty good Time: 11:20 - 11:30 [Music] i think you just broke the box on my head okay well here's the product kind of looks like i damaged it more Time: 11:30 - 11:40 than it damaged me we're talking a mouse that is just 0.5 centimeters thick incredible novelty but i just i can't quite understand apart from specifically this video Time: 11:40 - 11:50 who would buy this i feel like as we're getting further and further through this video each successive product is becoming more and more of a feat and this the remarkable 2 Time: 11:50 - 12:00 tablet might be the coolest so far it's not an android tablet per se but it is a smart tablet of sorts and it just feels a bit surreal to hold it's like it's got Time: 12:00 - 12:10 the density and the weight of a coaster for your mug it doesn't feel like there's anything in there so for starters this is an e-reader just like a kindle but with a Time: 12:10 - 12:20 high-resolution large screen you can read web pages on it but more importantly thanks to this pencil right here you can write all right let's just give this a shot a sub to the channel would be Time: 12:20 - 12:30 remarkable this is shockingly responsive for an e-ink type display and oh check this if you write with the pen completely upright it comes out narrow but if you Time: 12:30 - 12:40 use the sides it's thicker you can even rub out using the eraser on the back but then maybe the coolest aspect of this is that with one tab i can convert all this Time: 12:40 - 12:50 handwritten text into an editable format and then literally pick up my phone and carry on where i left off don't really know how to rate this one though i've never really used anything like it Time: 12:50 - 13:00 thinnest power bank in the world coming right up what in god's name okay hold up this is my normal power bank this is the clutch charger it's it's Time: 13:00 - 13:10 literally the size of a credit card and it's not as useless as you might think it still has led indicator lights to show you its charge level it's got the Time: 13:10 - 13:20 usbc cable baked inside it i guess because it's so thin that it otherwise wouldn't fit and the battery capacity itself is still three thousand milliamp hours which you know we've seen more Time: 13:20 - 13:30 we've seen way more but that's still enough to get your phone from completely dead to anywhere between 50 and 100 depending on what model is speaking of credit cards though at just Time: 13:30 - 13:40 0.15 centimeters which is basically two-dimensional at this point we have the win wallet i mean it's safe to say this is at least five times thinner than any other wallet i've ever seen it is Time: 13:40 - 13:50 very cool but i'm just thinking like when you get to a stage like this can you really call it a wallet like at this point isn't it basically just a 3d printed clip Time: 13:50 - 14:00 all right so just before the thinnest thing in this entire video i've got something pretty mind-blowing to show you you know how we had that thinnest espresso display well Time: 14:00 - 14:10 that is nothing compared to what royal has come up with okay so the display connector has got to go into the power board we're gonna need a power supply this is Time: 14:10 - 14:20 like really high stakes lego and then if we had a power source oh my god Time: 14:20 - 14:30 i genuinely think this is the coolest piece of tech i've ever held in my hands what you're looking at right now is a fully functional android device that's barely thicker than a piece of paper and Time: 14:30 - 14:40 it is completely flexible this is basically a development kit it's royal saying to other companies look look at our screen look how versatile it is look how bright and beautiful it is look how Time: 14:40 - 14:50 thin it is these screens already exist on some foldable phones that you might have already seen but it's just being able to hold the display on its own and use it as a standalone device it kind of Time: 14:50 - 15:00 just opens you up to what's potentially possible well let's see if we can make a call actually where am i going to fit a sim card in on that i sound like a broken record at this Time: 15:00 - 15:10 point but we are getting even thinner oh my i just realized something you know Time: 15:10 - 15:20 this like incredibly incredibly thin mouse mat we have here this is the mouse mat with a layer of packaging all around it Time: 15:20 - 15:30 it almost feels like i'm gripping air [Applause] oh oh i have never seen a mouse pad like it Time: 15:30 - 15:40 oh wait there's another layer to peel off that that's just ridiculous Time: 15:40 - 15:50 so there you have it the thinnest extreme pc setup ever okay so you know how we just got like the thinnest wallet ever and we were wondering what exactly we could pay for with it well Time: 15:50 - 16:00 surfsharkvpn hear me out here this service is not ten dollars or five dollars it is 249 a month which split between the seven people i share it with Time: 16:00 - 16:10 comes out to just 36 cents and that 36 cents gives me anonymity especially when i'm logged into public wi-fi networks which are the most vulnerable better prices for products that use my browser Time: 16:10 - 16:20 cookies to try to make things more expensive for me access to the full internet including sites blocked by my region like tv shows from another country and encryption every minute that Time: 16:20 - 16:30 you spend online companies are recording data about who you are and what you're doing which means that even if these companies don't have any nefarious intentions when there's a data breach Time: 16:30 - 16:40 that data can fall into the hands of someone who does things like your location information so give it a go and if you do hit the link in the description and use code boss it's not Time: 16:40 - 16:50 just that you get it for that 249 a month price but you also get three months for free on top of that fully refundable if you don't like it to check out some of the biggest tech you've ever seen that video is here or to check out Time: 16:50 - 17:00 some of the smallest videos here my name is aaron this is mr who's the boss [Music] Time: 17:00 - 17:10Man, I love how he went from a smartphone focused creator to just all inventions overall. This is incredible keep it up Arun 😃",

00:20 what would you know a sister or world-renowned smartphone enthusiast and I don't think I've ever seen karma bite back faster the comment section is Time: 00:20 - 00:30 filled with two types of responses people who've applied it and got away with it on their phones and who seem to be using it as a way to prove they've picked a superior device and the other Time: 00:30 - 00:40 less fortunate group who've applied it and quickly realized they probably shouldn't if they post the videos of their devices basically going schizo in a lot of cases they've had to wipe Time: 00:40 - 00:50 everything listen to the cat people the cat never lies anyways there are three unusual things that happen here number one that whether or not your device gets Time: 00:50 - 01:00 destroyed depends on who made it for example Google and Samsung they're know goes don't go there - if you upload the photo to a social Time: 01:00 - 01:10 media site like way bug and download it again the colors will shift to this less vibrant version and it's safe to use and three you might notice I've been showing you this wallpaper on my samsung phone Time: 01:10 - 01:20 this whole time and the way I've done that is just by taking a screenshot of the image and setting that as my wallpaper which is safe - on the face of it none of this makes sense so what the Time: 01:20 - 01:30 flip is going on here well I spell the last three days trying to find out okay my initial assumption was this is malware someone has obviously designed this wallpaper to Time: 01:30 - 01:40 conflict with the code of Android and start crashing phones the resolution is exactly 1440 by 2560 that is the current standard android wallpaper resolution it Time: 01:40 - 01:50 has been made to apply as a wallpaper and add to that I've never in my life seen a wallpaper that can so consistently kill phones what are the chances someone came across that by Time: 01:50 - 02:00 accident well did the more I dug into it the more it seems like my initial assumption was wrong I thought the best way to find out if something was malicious or not was to find out where it came from so I did a reverse image Time: 02:00 - 02:10 search Google Images has a clever little feature now that allows you to use an image to search for similar images and by doing this within two minutes Time: 02:10 - 02:20 I traced the cursed wallpaper back to its original source turns out the wallpaper being circulated around was not the original photo this is the original photo from hdq walls Time: 02:20 - 02:30 calm and if you don't know the original and check the data of the image you can see it is just a photo taken from a nikon d80 camera surely that can't be Time: 02:30 - 02:40 the problem this is just someone who's taken their camera to a national park maybe they've come tower overnight to get this stunning shot of a sunrise that's not gonna break your phone plus a lot of people online was saying that the Time: 02:40 - 02:50 reason the cursed photo was crushing ferns was because it was encoded in a color profile called Google's skier but singers are now managed to get hold of the original photo and I could see that this wasn't a Google skier image I Time: 02:50 - 03:00 applied it to my Galaxy S 20 ultra big mistake gone finito Galaxy S 20 ultra in one Time: 03:00 - 03:10 fell swoop mute I couldn't get past my lock screen and even safe mode wouldn't let me recover it all dater on that phone that I didn't backup is gone and I Time: 03:10 - 03:20 won't lie to you this felt like that part in a detective movie where the detective gets too involved in a case and the criminal isn't happy about it so he starts taking away family members Time: 03:20 - 03:30 from me I've lost my data trying to fight for this cause I thought it would be okay I thought this is the original image it's just a photo this can't be the problem but I was wrong and I'm a Time: 03:30 - 03:40 little bummed but a sub to the channel would be amazing but anyways we can see that this crashing then wasn't caused by some malicious third party who tampered Time: 03:40 - 03:50 with the image afterwards like I'd initially suspected it's the original photo that's enough to break your phone so that just leaves the question how okay let's talk about color for a minute Time: 03:50 - 04:00 take a look at this diagram this represents all the colors that us humans can see this triangle inside of it that's the sRGB color space it's a Time: 04:00 - 04:10 subset it's a small section of the full range of color and more importantly for this case it's the only set of colors that Android really understands so yes Time: 04:10 - 04:20 most Android phones historically they haven't been able to display the full range of color but they're limited like this for the sake of consistency sRGB is what almost Time: 04:20 - 04:30 every device is calibrated to digital cameras printers the Internet so by having an operating system based on it you can ensure that let's say I post Time: 04:30 - 04:40 something on Instagram for example then when you see that post on the other end it can make sure that you're seeing it in the way that I intended it or that when I see a photo online and I print it out it should look pretty similar to the Time: 04:40 - 04:50 preview I saw on screen but there are many different color spaces you've got Adobe RGB as an example which has a wider range of color or if you Time: 04:50 - 05:00 wanted to go a bit crazy with things prophoto RGB which is this huge triangle here and this all seems really complicated but all it means for this is that if I convert an image from srgb to Time: 05:00 - 05:10 Adobe RGB it's going to effectively stretch the color space the color that was previously here gets mapped to here so this is a random photo - it took a Time: 05:10 - 05:20 few days ago in srgb and moving it to the wider Adobe RGB it just gets more vibrant and the same will happen again if we move from Adobe to prophoto RGB because these points are moving to these Time: 05:20 - 05:30 points so what I got to do with the sunrise of nightmares well it turns out prophoto RGB is the colour space that Time: 05:30 - 05:40 this photo is encoded in and you can see the appeal of doing this now that I know how it was encoded I can actually flick it back to standard srgb and it becomes this this is the true original photo and Time: 05:40 - 05:50 all of a sudden it doesn't look so hot so whoever took the photo probably just thought oh I really like the colors in prophoto RGB mode I'll just export it Time: 05:50 - 06:00 that way and this explains what I mentioned earlier about Weibo Weibo doesn't support this ultra white color space so if you upload a profile encoded image to Weibo the reason it changes is Time: 06:00 - 06:10 because it's actually being converted back to srgb so okay we've established that something about this color space is causing a problem but it's not as simple Time: 06:10 - 06:20 as that because Android can actually handle Profoto even though Android support srgb only it is programmed to convert images from other color spaces back to srgb just so we can have that Time: 06:20 - 06:30 level of consistency trust me I wish this was simpler too but when le though it seems like this conversion is actually where the problem is where Android is trying to turn this Time: 06:30 - 06:40 Profoto into an sRGB image that's the bottleneck and you won't believe this the reason these devices are crashing all comes down to one pixel this one Time: 06:40 - 06:50 right here according to de'vide who I was talking to about this google's color engine can't for the life of it convert this one pixel to srgb specifically because of the luminance of Time: 06:50 - 07:00 it luminance is basically brightness but just adjust it for the way that we humans actually see things because you might know this humans see green tones Time: 07:00 - 07:10 far better than we see red tones and we see Red's better than we see blues so the luminance of a pixel on Android is calculated by this formula it gives green the most weight then red Time: 07:10 - 07:20 and then blue to put it another way you need a lot of blue light to give the same luminance as a little bit of green light anyway the max value of red green Time: 07:20 - 07:30 or blue individually is 255 so the way this code is put together you shouldn't be able to get an overall combined value past 255 because all the formulas really Time: 07:30 - 07:40 doing is taking a weighted average but for this one particular pixel it just so happens that the red green and the blue values are all incredibly high 255 255 Time: 07:40 - 07:50 and 243 so plugging it into the formula we get red as 54.2 1/3 green has 180 2.3 Time: 07:50 - 08:00 76 and blue is 17.5 for 4-6 if you add all these up you got around 254 which is still under 255 so what's the problem it Time: 08:00 - 08:10 turns out Google uses a type of rounding that basically rounds each one of these numbers up so those RGB values actually end up as 55 plus 183 plus 18 which gives 256 Time: 08:10 - 08:20 which is over the theoretical maximum of 2 5 5 error 1 number in one pixel is Time: 08:20 - 08:30 enough to send your device into this spiral of doom in a normal situation when Android encounters a problem like this it'll try to close the process but Time: 08:30 - 08:40 by setting it as your wallpaper Android can't just close it you're creating a permanent loop of errors as it keeps trying to fix itself and and this also explains why screenshots Time: 08:40 - 08:50 of the image are safe there's a bit of a misconception with screenshots when you screenshot a photo your Android phone is not making a copy of the photo it's creating a new image that by default is going to be an sRGB Time: 08:50 - 09:00 shot because it's Android so that conversion that's causing all the crashes doesn't need to occur if you're wondering why only some devices are Time: 09:00 - 09:10 broken by the wallpaper it's because they're all phones that use Google's default color engine which is the part that's messing up the conversion as however you should worry about it not Time: 09:10 - 09:20 really I mean obviously don't apply this wallpaper ever but I've been working a bunch of developers been working for hours continuously trying to recreate Time: 09:20 - 09:30 the error and we couldn't so the chances that you're gonna see this popping up in other wallpapers I think is pretty low but just for peace of mind the next Android 11 should be fixing this problem anyway it is a pretty easy Time: 09:30 - 09:40 one to solve you just need one line of code that says if this value is above 255 then make it 255 anyways this has been a stressful video to medic if you Time: 09:40 - 09:50 enjoyed it do consider subscribing and huge thanks to Michelle on Twitter and daveed who's working on his own custom ROM called POS P right now Time: 09:50 - 10:00 those guys have helped out massively with this without being said my name is Aaron this is mr. E's boss and I'll catch you in the next one [Music] Time: 10:00 - 10:10Big F's for the photographer, who just wanted a cool looking picture",

      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:10 might sound strange now but the original PlayStation was actually a massive risk for Sony because put simply Sony was a nobody in 1994 the entire gaming Market was just two companies Nintendo who hit Time: 00:10 - 00:20 a home run with the creation of Mario and had about 40% market share and Seager who having created Sonic their equivalent to Mario had taken the market by form to achieve a share of 55% both Time: 00:20 - 00:30 of these Titans were fighting tooth and nail to try and make their mascot the greatest 2D platformer of all time but Sony realized something that now is the Time: 00:30 - 00:40 perfect time for 3D yeah this is a real sealed PlayStation 1 straight from 1994 and inside we've got the video adapter in case your TV didn't have the right connectors the AC adapter to plug into Time: 00:40 - 00:50 the mains the controller which was of course wired and the console hopefully it turns on this is ancient equipment that sound Time: 00:50 - 01:00 that's basically the sound of a cathode ray gun shooting electrons at the display panel that's actually why they're called CRT TVs power on the original PlayStation buttons kind of want to Time: 01:00 - 01:10 experience opening the disc drive it's actually making me kind of sad that modern technology has no moving Parts listen to this Time: 01:10 - 01:20 no the controller is so light it kind of feels like it's not even there and also look at this no analog sticks there's one thing Sony smashed its buttons this is so nice now with only 2 MB of ram a Time: 01:20 - 01:30 maximum resolution of 480p and no internal storage the PS1 stats might sound pitiful by modern standards I literally had to Amazon a 128 kilobyte Time: 01:30 - 01:40 storage card for it which is very weird thing to do in 2022 but at the time when it was released at today's equivalent of $570 this was the most powerful console Time: 01:40 - 01:50 money could buy so this is Gran Turismo running on the PS1 and if you compare it to Nintendo or sega's supposed 3D offerings you'll quickly notice that Sony is the only one capable of Time: 01:50 - 02:00 rendering real 3D models with real Reflections on the cars it looks insane in comparison but wait till you see what the next PlayStation can do Sony also realized that they couldn't just be more Time: 02:00 - 02:10 powerful their brand also had to be different to Nintendo and AES and their way of doing that was swapping the controller letters for shapes and it wasn't cuz Sony loved geometry the Time: 02:10 - 02:20 shapes have significance for example the Blue Cross and the red circle they represent yes and no which even now to this day is still what they're used for in games Sony did also follow up the Time: 02:20 - 02:30 original PlayStation with what's referred to as the PlayStation slim but if I'm being really honest we will be here forever if we start on the variations of each console so long story short this company saw an opportunity Time: 02:30 - 02:40 and they absolutely smashed it with the first PlayStation they completely wiped out Sega for good and practically pulled Nintendo's pants down coming out of nowhere with the PS1 becoming the first Time: 02:40 - 02:50 console ever to pass 100 million units sold so how did Sony top that well only by releasing the bestselling console in the history of consoles Sony's approach Time: 02:50 - 03:00 to the PlayStation 2 released in 2000 at about $485 in today's money so significantly cheaper than the PS1 can be summed up with one phrase if it ain't Time: 03:00 - 03:10 broke don't fix it the PS2 is evolution not Revolution and the unboxing experience also mirrors that philosophy you get an upgraded controller as well as a similar AC cable and TV adapter to Time: 03:10 - 03:20 last time oh this brings back so many memories almost everything about the PS2 is a direct No Frills improvement over its predecessor it comes with about 12 Time: 03:20 - 03:30 times the amount of raw processing power depending on how you measure it 16 times the amount of RAM and no less than 63 times the amount of storage on the default memory card this had 8 mbes Time: 03:30 - 03:40 remember back in the day consoles didn't used to have these enormous hard drives inside of them to be able to install games onto the entire game would be fit onto the game disc itself and so the Time: 03:40 - 03:50 only extra storage you needed was just a memory card for your save files which you could then take out and Carry Your saves to your friend's house with so if we turn the PS2 on Time: 03:50 - 04:00 oh this is my childhood so there's an eject button up here that sounds amazing you can barely read the actual text of what these things are that difference is Time: 04:00 - 04:10 crazy the difference versus the PS1 is absolutely night and day the processing power allows it to render many times the amount of polygons on screen which Time: 04:10 - 04:20 reduces the blocky look of the PS1 era and the extra Ram allows for background textures to just have way more going on in them like even the Finish Line Banner it now blows about in the wind and the Time: 04:20 - 04:30 master stroke with the PS2 was how Sony managed to through the design of the console make it extremely clear that this was a next gen bitter kit there's been a few consoles in the past like Time: 04:30 - 04:40 Nintendo's Wii U that look so similar to their last gen counterparts that people thought that they were just add-ons not here the ps2's design is far more bulky Time: 04:40 - 04:50 and angular with this grill that was really meant to evoke the feeling of an engine something capable of real power that combined with some of the best games of the generation led the PlayStation to to break every record Time: 04:50 - 05:00 ever set selling 158 million units you had Nintendo's GameCube and Microsoft's original Xbox also around at this time but they didn't even sell a fifth as Time: 05:00 - 05:10 much as the PS2 did and to keep up with the increasing complexity of the games Sony also upgraded the controller with something they called dual shock which is a combination of dual analog sticks Time: 05:10 - 05:20 and built-in Rumble technology so you can really feel the the texture of the grass and if you're not a good driver like me the texture of the wall son wasn't kidding with the word Rumble the Time: 05:20 - 05:30 PS2 was also technically the first time you could play your games online but you had to rely on the individual game developers to create their own servers as Sony didn't develop their own Time: 05:30 - 05:40 infrastructure for online connectivity until the PlayStation 3 arguably the first Sony console to properly Herald in the digital age this time round internet Time: 05:40 - 05:50 was a focus hence he included ethernet cable as well as the TV output cables and a USB mini cable to charge the further upgraded now wireless controller I probably don't need to tell you but the PS3 was also the boldest console Time: 05:50 - 06:00 Sony had ever made look at this beef Cake Plus do you recognize that text yeah that's the Spider-Man font cuz Sony owns the Spider-Man IP and they thought Time: 06:00 - 06:10 it would help them to sell more consoles it did not the good news is that the PS3 took some notes from the PS2 in the ramp everything up Department the bad news is Time: 06:10 - 06:20 that this time that also included the price to try and make the PS3 feel like a completely new era in gaming Sony had a special custom cell processor designed just for it but this was really Time: 06:20 - 06:30 expensive pushing the launch price of this console all the way up to $869 in today's money supremely pricey especially given the console's creaky Time: 06:30 - 06:40 plastic exterior but oh boy was this thing powerful as a matter of fact as an overall system it was about 35 times more powerful than the PS2 making it 384 Time: 06:40 - 06:50 times more powerful than the PS1 these are ridiculous numbers in fact the PS3 was so Advanced that it was actually used to build supercomputers incl a truly genius move by Stanford University Time: 06:50 - 07:00 researchers who developed an app called folding at home which allowed PS3 users to dedicate a portion of their supercomputing power to Aid with complex Time: 07:00 - 07:10 protein folding calculations used to learn more about how to prevent diseases like Alzheimer's it was also pretty good at games so I never actually owned a PS3 at launch but I remember how I felt when Time: 07:10 - 07:20 my friend got on for the first time it really felt like a machine from the future like I remember being just giddy with excitement that something of this power actually existed you also notice Time: 07:20 - 07:30 they've actually started putting attention into how the discs look at this point and the dis loading mechanism that's all inside the console now there's no tray that comes in and out this console is not quiet or cool for Time: 07:30 - 07:40 that matter it's like an oven back here and it's only on the home screen you can kind of see that this is the point where the console became much more than just a place to play video games it's the first time there's a proper home screen that you would actually want to spend time in Time: 07:40 - 07:50 this literally used to be one of the coolest things in the world to me the fact that you could change your home screen color oh yeah the friends tab I spent a lot of time there you think at Time: 07:50 - 08:00 that point that you can't make the same generational leap again but this is it and also you can actually feel the mechanics of the game becoming more sophisticated as well there's more physics involved one problem that PS3 Time: 08:00 - 08:10 owners did used to have though was that because the onoff button was capacitive their pets would often turn their consoles off don't get any ideas so now we have the PS3 Grand Time: 08:10 - 08:20 Turismo next to the PS2 next to the PS1 I can't wait to complete this line but already the leap is phenomenal the first key difference being resolution while Time: 08:20 - 08:30 the PS1 is outputting the game at 512x 240 the PS2 is pushing over three times more pixels at 852 x 480 and the PS3 was running at two times that at 1280 by 720 Time: 08:30 - 08:40 or in other words for the very first time true high definition gaming this is basically the difference between you going into the settings on this video and swapping between 240p 480p and 720p Time: 08:40 - 08:50 massive but it's not just more pixels it's also much more complex game effects one of the most impressive things about the PlayStation 3 was its ability to Time: 08:50 - 09:00 also handle almost lifelike lighting shadows and Reflections not to mention vast sprawling backgrounds something else I'm noticing is is how much nicer the controller is it's wireless it's Time: 09:00 - 09:10 weightier cuz it's now got an inbuilt battery and also has motion sensors built into it and also compared to the ps2's controller the triggers just have much more travel they call this the six Time: 09:10 - 09:20 axis controller because as well as all the buttons it could also pick up how you move the controller itself and translate that into the game even though it was the home to god tier games like Grand Theft Auto 5 and the last of us Time: 09:20 - 09:30 even though it was where Sony launched their free online Playstation network service even though it also doubled as a media machine with full Blue-ray disc compatibility Sony really screwed up Time: 09:30 - 09:40 that pricing it ended up selling 84 million units barely half of the PS2 and was slightly outsold by Microsoft's Xbox 360 Sony was on the back foot again they needed to do something special Time: 09:40 - 09:50 thankfully Microsoft did their job for them when the PlayStation 4 launched up against the Xbox One in 2013 Microsoft screwed up their marketing so badly that Time: 09:50 - 10:00 Sony could have re-released the PlayStation 3 and probably still won the fact that Microsoft forced users to also buy the connect camera with the console forced users to be always online and Time: 10:00 - 10:10 focused almost completely on how the next gen Xbox would work as a TV box rather than a games console it made it almost too easy for team blue Sony even Time: 10:10 - 10:20 took to the stage to rip apart the Xbox One's deliberate inability to play borrowed games this is how you share your games on PS4 thanks and it was pretty much game over Time: 10:20 - 10:30 at that point now when you add to this that the PS4 was also insanely well-designed it starts to make sense why it completely popped off like check Time: 10:30 - 10:40 out the new dual shock 4 controller it incorporates the dual shock Tech from the PS2 controller and the Sixaxis motion sensing from the PS3 controller and it makes both aspects much more Time: 10:40 - 10:50 refined the analog sticks are now also further apart and they're concave for better grip there's a new share button which reflects the shift to social gaming plus we've not also got an RGB Time: 10:50 - 11:00 LED light on the front as an identifier for which player you are a speaker in the controller itself for a directional sound experience and even a 2-in touchpad in the middle for menu navigation I remember the moment that I Time: 11:00 - 11:10 got to hold one of these for the first time and I was just sat there like an idiot like turning it over and over in my hands for 10 minutes straight thinking holy cow this is real the PS4 Time: 11:10 - 11:20 is about 10 times more powerful than the PS3 making it the numbers are getting kind of out of hand at this point about 3,800 times as powerful as the PS1 it Time: 11:20 - 11:30 had 8 GB of RAM which is 32 times the PS3 and 4,096 times the original PlayStation and not to mention that because the PS4 is based off a less custom more standard pc- like Time: 11:30 - 11:40 architecture it was way easier for developers to work with it and fully extract that power you know this kind of reminds me of the really really early Time: 11:40 - 11:50 days of this channel I remember when the PS4 launched we had about 10,000 subscribers I know that cuz we used to cover tons of gaming content at the time but I would stick to handheld because I Time: 11:50 - 12:00 would never dream of spending this much on one console I know this section is all about the PS4 but all I can hear is this PS3 so this actually quite exciting this is the first time you can turn the console on with the controller so this Time: 12:00 - 12:10 is very much a refined version of the PS3's home screen much more blocky in style oh my god listen to it it's louder than the PS3 there was me Time: 12:10 - 12:20 thinking this was going to be a nice Sleek quiet machine I only half blame Sony this room that we're in is basically a sauna right now boots up the game you can also tell the text is way Time: 12:20 - 12:30 sharper and more readable now you can actually now pick the exact time of day of your race and it will affect the weather conditions accordingly you can feel such a visceral difference the density of the crowd the the light Time: 12:30 - 12:40 coming rarely from the Sun all right so I've actually filled up a bag with ice just to cool it down cuz this is getting ridiculous I'm going to lay it on top of the ice pack in my mind this is what a Time: 12:40 - 12:50 modern racing game looks like the game almost has like an atmosphere that the other ones lack excuse my driving I can actually also notice a bit of realistic damage on my car so upgraded physics too what do you do with this much power then Time: 12:50 - 13:00 well I mean just for starters a further doubling of the resolution to now 1080P or full HD the PS4 could happily fill a 40-in TV and not look like it was being Time: 13:00 - 13:10 stretched and it also just gave developers the head room to be creative to build not just detailed backgrounds but fully open worlds to execute their Visions in their entirety plus they Time: 13:10 - 13:20 could now add pretty much any visual effect they could think of dirt particles motion blur realistic fog and it's in these details where you really feel the difference versus the PS3 so Time: 13:20 - 13:30 when you combine all of this with the fact that the PlayStation 4 also launched at a much friendlier $500 in today's money it's not surprising that it went on to sell 120 million units Time: 13:30 - 13:40 more than doubling Microsoft's competing Xbox one it's kind of hard to imagine how this masterpiece can actually now be seen as a relic of the past but the PS5 Time: 13:40 - 13:50 firmly pushes it aside cementing itself as the wildest most futuristic PlayStation to ever exist and Sony has really run with this idea of futurism Time: 13:50 - 14:00 everything from the controller to the console to the headset they launch alongside it it all shares this two-tone Ultra minimalistic Space Age design philosophy and I freaking love it The Time: 14:00 - 14:10 Moment I Saw the PS5 get announced I shrieked like what gamer doesn't want a console that looks like a literal alien Starship and I mean it makes the Xbox series X that it's competing against Time: 14:10 - 14:20 look like a prude by comparison there is also this strangely shaped stand which actually very cleverly can support the console either horizont Al or vertically Time: 14:20 - 14:30 but do the internals keep up absolutely the PlayStation 5 dunks on its predecessor it has two times the Ram at 16 GB and its core Graphics processing unit is about eight times more powerful Time: 14:30 - 14:40 and that's not even factoring in its Solid State Storage that's at least 50 times faster than the PlayStation 4's hard drive and this is the fun part about compounding multiples when Time: 14:40 - 14:50 compared to the original PS1 the PS5 is approximately 30,000 times more powerful you can make a bridge of PlayStation ones spanning an entire city and it Time: 14:50 - 15:00 still wouldn't be able to outperform a single PS5 let's see how the PS5 Compares love these LEDs on the inside such a classy touch this is such a fun video as well hey if you want to see me Time: 15:00 - 15:10 make a comparison of every Nintendo console ever and a sub to the channel would be historic oh my God I'm I'm blinded adjust HDR oh that is actually Time: 15:10 - 15:20 one of the new features here just like insane levels of contrast I know we're only on the homepage right now but this screen the one thing you really notice about the PS5 UI is everything is very Visual and full screen wow the amount of Time: 15:20 - 15:30 buildings you can see you can see individual settlements over here in the background okay just look at the difference in color between this screen Time: 15:30 - 15:40 and this screen a lot of that is just the new high dynamic range I can hear Applause coming through the speaker in the controller you can even see the clouds in the sky reflected on the body Time: 15:40 - 15:50 of my car and moving in real time oh my God it's so rumbly okay this is a huge upgrade even from the PS4 not only is the resolution now full 4K four times Time: 15:50 - 16:00 higher than 1080p but the PS5 is also capable of realtime rate tracing meaning that instead of pre-baking the light Reflections into a scene like most video games have done till now this console Time: 16:00 - 16:10 can simulate the real physical behavior of light in real time and how it affects every single Pixel on screen and I can also feel not just the general Rumble from my engine thanks to dual shock but Time: 16:10 - 16:20 also the physical sensation of putting pressure on the pedal thanks to the new adaptive triggers in this controller that can adjust their tension on on the fly every PlayStation console together Time: 16:20 - 16:30 in one frame what a sight imagine what the ps6 is going to look like now a slick as the PS5 does look there is one way to make it even Slicker these are Time: 16:30 - 16:40 dark plates and not only do they make your console matte black but they add vents to allow more air to pass through they reduce the temperature on the inside of the console and they also trim the corners to make it more compact much Time: 16:40 - 16:50 needed with the size of this thing but it's not just a customization for the sides of the console you can also pick up a middle skin to cover up those unavoidable scuffs on the glossy piano black plastic I've gone for matte black Time: 16:50 - 17:00 all the way around but you can also get retro gray which is color matched to the original PlayStation 1 or just classic white and if that's still not enough customization dark plates have one more Time: 17:00 - 17:10 trick light scripts these are basically light filters that you put on top of the existing lights that your PS5 has to change the color of them to whatever you want it to be link below to check out Time: 17:10 - 17:20 dark plates to see me buy the weirdest Tech on the entire internet click here I'll catch you there Time: 17:20 - 17:30This is my first \"Gaming\" video in about 4 years!

00:20 by okay I have like a billion questions about this we got to try it what are the things we expect the future will have how about this uh invisibility Time: 00:20 - 00:30 bu oh this is great yes we need to do an invisibility Shield if you haven't seen one of these already it's going to feel like magic futuristic bike I remember seeing this a Time: 00:30 - 00:40 while ago on the internet as like a concept device that could hypothetically exist 3,496 it's like $4,000 there's no way we Time: 00:40 - 00:50 can have the opportunity to test something like that and then not do it what would a person from the future use as their tools the Neo ruler rule rule the scales didn't realize the battle for Time: 00:50 - 01:00 rulers was that intense so this thing is claiming to be a speaker that can focus its sound output directly to one Time: 01:00 - 01:10 person and the whole speaker is made of glass as well this is so futuristic gy ooh that's interesting so it's like a smart mirror but it's also Time: 01:10 - 01:20 saying that it contains your beautiful new personal trainer benefit from AI powered form feedback live body tracking and rep Counting all in a hologram wall Time: 01:20 - 01:30 mirror I'd be dumb not to give it a go we can't do a futuristic Tech video without a robot uh so this is world's first direct drive self-balancing wheel Time: 01:30 - 01:40 legged robot feels like they really wanted to be first at something I say that but this actually looks amazing I Time: 01:40 - 01:50 don't think I've ever seen a robot with this level of agility okay well this one has my attention um you can ride it hey 8 m per hour I'll never miss a flight Time: 01:50 - 02:00 again oh wait it seems like the same company also has another suitcase that follows you add two bag M the new Time: 02:00 - 02:10 Rayband meta smart glasses I have heard that these glasses are the best implementation of the smart glasses concept to ever exist how close can you get to a real life hologram nowadays you Time: 02:10 - 02:20 can actually get something called the Looking Glass portrait oh it's the only commercially available display on the market that's able to Showcase 3D cont content without the need for eye Time: 02:20 - 02:30 tracking or glasses I'm still very confused but this is the kind of thing we need to test I remember this company wooder they make these like haptic vests so you wear them and you plug yourself Time: 02:30 - 02:40 into like a game you're playing and that suddenly allows you to feel the game you're playing and it looks like they've managed to condense that experience that previously would have involved you Time: 02:40 - 02:50 wearing this basically jumpsuit to just a strap speaking of straps one strap endless possibilities Time: 02:50 - 03:00 flexible to stiff with a with a Twist yeah boy okay marketing aside this actually looks like a really impressive Time: 03:00 - 03:10 this actually looks like a really really impressive product like it allows you to wear your phone around your neck or around your wrist or around your waist and then just twist it to make it stiff Time: 03:10 - 03:20 oh actually I do know a tech company whose entire thing is being futuristic gravar this is cool this is my Jem [Music] Time: 03:20 - 03:30 there's a whole category of speakers called ferof fluid speakers they use a magnetic fluid to create a visual response to music these pencils have a Time: 03:30 - 03:40 really interesting mechanism that allows them to self [Music] Time: 03:40 - 03:50 sharpen okay stop me I don't think I've ever been this excited for the stuff to arrive Time: 03:50 - 04:00 it's all finally here some of this stuff took over 2 months to arrive so in a way we very much are filming this in the future so let's go roughly from least expensive to the most expensive to find Time: 04:00 - 04:10 out how much it really costs to experience that next era so just $10 self sharpening mechanical pencils so you know when you're using a normal pencil the reason it gets blunt is cuz Time: 04:10 - 04:20 as you're writing you're holding the pencil from one consistent angle and kind of sanding away at the tip so these guys realize how to fix that by creating a system such that every single time you apply and remove pressure from the tip Time: 04:20 - 04:30 it rotates the lead so that even if you're writing from one consistent angle you're actually equally using every side of the pencil there's really not much to say about it apart from the fact that it Time: 04:30 - 04:40 really does work and every pencil should use one of these the entire sharpening industry would disappear so I'm going to give this a 6 out of 10 so then all the way up at $60 we have the futuristic Time: 04:40 - 04:50 charger from gravar and actually while we're at it let's just do all the gra Star Products so that's the earbuds and speaker wa if nothing else it all looks cool Time: 04:50 - 05:00 let's hope there's more to it than that okay so the charger it doesn't initially strike me as the most space efficient with this whole transforming standing sitting design like they've used a really high-tech material called gallium nitride to be able to get it to a really Time: 05:00 - 05:10 condensed size but then bulked it back up again with all the external fluff Like It's a 65 W charger which is not bad that's two times faster than the iPhone's fast charger but then at the Time: 05:10 - 05:20 same time if all you wanted was a 65 W power brick you can get one in a smaller footprint at a lower price it's not really futuristic you're paying for design you're paying for these rotating ears is you're paying for the fact that Time: 05:20 - 05:30 the eyes light up you're paying for the fact that it transforms from a sitting to a standing position but actually only if you don't have your plug in on top of that because then it's locked in 5 out Time: 05:30 - 05:40 of 10 but then with the earbuds the design actually has a purpose these things feel so premium like listen to these sounds oh it's got an RGB lighting strip baked into the charging case of Time: 05:40 - 05:50 the earphones you can very much tell this is made for someone who really wants to carry around a gadget let's do a sound test they do fit really well with a good amount to passive noise Time: 05:50 - 06:00 cancellation without any Tech going on that's a bit of a shame the one airphone that is working does sound pretty good but the fact that straight out of the box one of them isn't connecting properly it's not a great sign for the Time: 06:00 - 06:10 software stability to come but you know what the funniest thing is you know the main extra function of this earb Cas there's a bottle opener I couldn't believe it let's uh let's see if it Time: 06:10 - 06:20 works whose idea was this I mean earphones bottle opener the kinds of situations that you would use both of those in are so different but also more Time: 06:20 - 06:30 importantly was it worth this was it worth carving out a massive triangle in this valuable real estate that is your charging case at the direct cost of Time: 06:30 - 06:40 battery futuristic in a Dumb Way 3 out of 10 that's nice though but the speaker is the thing that I'm most excited for I'm already liking a lot of the little touches like these tiny little rubber Time: 06:40 - 06:50 pads at the bottom which means when you plunk it on a table it massively softens the thud okay cool ready to pair Lo connected I can respect that some nice Time: 06:50 - 07:00 startup sounds oh there's a ton of different lighting modes as well you know for something that's designed to be straight out of a sci-fi movie This is actually weirdly well suited to Camping Time: 07:00 - 07:10 ah okay so it's got a small Tweeter here which is what's handling the high notes and then a larger subwofer coming out the bottom which is what's handling the base and it's pretty mid-range to be Time: 07:10 - 07:20 honest it sounds like a $50 speaker the lighting's cool though so I'll give it a five all right let's see what the lighting of the future has in store for us this is the bioluminescent and all Time: 07:20 - 07:30 and I got to say I do love the idea of a future where we're not just pumping out greenhouse gases to fuel our increasingly electric Lifestyles but actually harnessing the Earth's natural resources to live a sustainable life and Time: 07:30 - 07:40 this might actually be one step closer to that Vision so apparently in this bag right here is a specific species of live microalgae that can take in carbon Time: 07:40 - 07:50 dioxide release oxygen kind of like a plant so I just dropped some on my table but also in that process produce light emitting chemicals so we basically pour Time: 07:50 - 08:00 what's left into the orb I'm going to leave that in a place where it's getting plenty of light for now and then what it says is that it's only going to Glow not just in the dark but specifically at nighttime so we will just cover the Time: 08:00 - 08:10 other stuff and loop back to it at the end oh I've just realized there's a massive do not drink on the front which means someone's tried it I could totally see how you'd think this would be a Time: 08:10 - 08:20 superhero origin story I don't blame you I'm slightly curious okay and while we wait to see the kind of lighting that nature can generate let's find out what humans are to do because this product Time: 08:20 - 08:30 right here claims to have bottled both fire and the Northern Lights into something that can sit on your shelf okay so really all this is is's a bunch of high power LEDs at the bottom shooting up at a deformed glass cylinder Time: 08:30 - 08:40 which refracts them and I mean there is stuff to like here like the glass cylinder is surprisingly high quality the reflections it makes on the walls and especially the ceiling really Time: 08:40 - 08:50 genuinely interesting to the point where I would say it kind of delivers on its prominis plus you get a little remote to change the colors I really like this one it reminds me so much of the Reflections coming off water but here's the thing I Time: 08:50 - 09:00 hate these remotes these remotes are a sign that what you actually have at the core of this product is very cheap LEDs for me Tech that is genuinely smart is Tech that will use your phone or voice Time: 09:00 - 09:10 for controlling but the more fundamental problem is that this was meant to rotate by itself there's a motor there and when it arrived it was already fried which Time: 09:10 - 09:20 does not bode well for the overall quality of this thing so the idea is great it can be pretty but I this is just a bit sad isn't it 4 out of 10 at $80 then we have what's claiming to Time: 09:20 - 09:30 be the future of the phone stand and while initially I could not wrap my head around how a phone stand could possibly be $80 now I can see it this is the Time: 09:30 - 09:40 morph strap you know the whole flexible to stiff thing yeah it's that now the company's being pretty tight lipped about how exactly it works but it seems like this lever here is basically a Time: 09:40 - 09:50 crank that tightens or loosens the internal structure sitting under this fabric so the company's idea is let's say you're walking around on holiday and you carry your phone around your neck as you do the second you want to take a Time: 09:50 - 10:00 photo bam selfie stick I'll be it a slightly bent one I mean that's not really what I'd use it for what I'm more interested in is can this be a way to Time: 10:00 - 10:10 mount your phone onto like any surface to take a weird shot for example the answer to which is yeah pretty much I just had an idea so I'm thinking Time: 10:10 - 10:20 hypothetically if I was in the back seat of a car and I wanted to watch a TV show while I'm on the go does work 7 out of 10 I feel like there's a lot more you can do with this Time: 10:20 - 10:30 than I've even realized at this point and then to measure how long your stiff phone strap is here's the ne ruler which is such an awesome name for what seems to be the one ruler to ruler the all you Time: 10:30 - 10:40 place the ruler next to it you raise the slider till you reach the point you want to measure and then that on screen is the exact measurement and there's an obvious initial question here in that my Time: 10:40 - 10:50 $1 ruler does the exact same thing who asked for them to over complicate it this much well for starters this thing is accurate to the nearest 0 01 mm which Time: 10:50 - 11:00 is a level of precision that you can't get by just eyeing it the fact that it's digital means that you can change units on the Fly you can flip between millimeters inches even meters if you want to but also you can do crazy stuff Time: 11:00 - 11:10 like let's say you're measuring an architect's drawing or a map for example I just bought one yesterday and it's just a bit bigger than I was expecting Time: 11:10 - 11:20 so you know a lot of these drawings have a scale right like uh 1 to 500,000 or in the case of this map 1 to 5 you can let the ruler know that scale and then as Time: 11:20 - 11:30 you're measuring it will not just tell you how many millimeters it is in reality but also what the actual real life distances of that space really are or for another example let's say that you wanted to divide something evenly Time: 11:30 - 11:40 you can choose on this ruler how many divisions you want and then you literally just pull the slider across and it will tell you exactly where to make those divisions Niche yes Time: 11:40 - 11:50 completely next level for the people who actually have use for it also yes 8 out of 10 so now on the complete other end of the spectrum our shoes yeah apparently Future shoes only come with Time: 11:50 - 12:00 half the packaging so we already know that this shoe it bends in half but why well this entire range of Fes products Time: 12:00 - 12:10 was actually inspired by a letter from Matthew waltzer a 16-year-old living with cerebral pulsy who said that because of his disability he couldn't tie Nike's shoelaces so Nike set themselves an internal challenge to Time: 12:10 - 12:20 basically try and create a pair of shoes that you could take off with no hands and this actually requires quite a big rethink of how the shoe works like you need a h H that allows the shoe to snap Time: 12:20 - 12:30 into the open and closed positions you need this tension band that spans both sections you need to make sure that the sole stays flat when the shoe opens so that it doesn't form a crease and then Time: 12:30 - 12:40 on top of that a kickstand which is what actually allows you to kick the shoe into this folded position so how well does it actually work it's a real life Time: 12:40 - 12:50 product showcase it's Mor strap time Crank that into position there you go look at that it's the cameraman of the Future Okay so foot slides into this top Time: 12:50 - 13:00 half it feels pretty loose right now but then wow all of a sudden that's like a perfect fit that's the easiest shoe putting on experience I've ever had and Time: 13:00 - 13:10 then when you want to take it off a little bit of pressure at the bottom there and your shoe folds in half that's crazy I was skeptical but now I am completely sold at least on the vision Time: 13:10 - 13:20 it's yet to be determined if all these extra moving Parts add any extra fragility to the shoe but this is a concept that I want to see more companies trying 9 out of 10 so I've tried haptic vest before but Time: 13:20 - 13:30 what's really interesting to me about this wua strap is how it's got the potential to still add another dimension to games and music without having to look like you're gearing up to go to Time: 13:30 - 13:40 actual War okay so the way this works is it basically sits in between your Sound Source let's say your PS5 and then your sound output let's say your headphones it intercepts that audio and then it Time: 13:40 - 13:50 turns the low notes which could be gunfire or you crashing into the wall in a car into physical impact that you can feel and then passes on the rest of the audio for your headphones to play as Time: 13:50 - 14:00 usual it does have physical ports for when you want to manually wire something in like I've done for my PS5 controller but it is also fully Bluetooth so that's how it's paired to these headphones would you look at that oh and Time: 14:00 - 14:10 then there's also an app where you can control volume you can control intensity obviously we're on the maximum but also you can control RGB color which feels a Time: 14:10 - 14:20 little silly for me for a device intended to not actually be looked at I'm feeling so much impact just from the standard loungy Jazzy menu music you know this is the kind of product that is Time: 14:20 - 14:30 very easy to write off as a gimmick but I would actually say as far as the experience of feeling like you're in a car this goes probably further than one of those like steering wheel accessories Time: 14:30 - 14:40 that I've seen a lot of people buy like I feel like I'm feeling the real texture of the road and the grunt of the engine I guess if you're a massive car Enthusiast You' also probably notice the way that different cars feel physically Time: 14:40 - 14:50 okay I'm just going to go for it I'm just going to ster off into [Music] the oh okay so the actual final impact was not Time: 14:50 - 15:00 actually as much as I thought it was going to be I don't think this has the single- handed ability to deliver the authentic car crash experience this probably isn't the way to make it feel like if you're playing Cod that you're Time: 15:00 - 15:10 actually heading into a real war zone but what it is is a really effective way of adding in that General lower level immersion that you probably don't realize you're missing until you take one of those off I wasn't Time: 15:10 - 15:20 woed Jud okay also around this price the invisibility Shield let's have a look so this is how the thing comes and I know Time: 15:20 - 15:30 it looks like I just went to my dumpster I pulled out a sheet of corrugated plastic and I stuck it here but no this is a specially crafted material where every single one of these vertical strips is a curved lens that bends light Time: 15:30 - 15:40 away from the center which has the very surreal implication that you could be looking head on at something and not actually be able to see it which is useful for I mean yes magic tricks but Time: 15:40 - 15:50 also stuff like camouflage in the military I wouldn't say it's useful for most people but from the perspective of it being a working science lesson in action given eight and then even more Time: 15:50 - 16:00 futuristic than that the holographic display very few things scream future like hologram but then I suppose at the same time we have seen so many poor executions of this concept it makes it Time: 16:00 - 16:10 feel like you're physically holding a memory in your hands and you're able to look around within it it almost feels like a very good trailer for immersive Time: 16:10 - 16:20 content so stage one of what this thing can do is turn a 2D image into a 3D image so this right here is a normal photo that I took on my iPhone and look at this the software actually allows you Time: 16:20 - 16:30 to visualize what it's like to look around inside it using Ai and look what happens when I pick up this depth in a slider and drag it across you can actually see the image being manipulated Time: 16:30 - 16:40 in real time it's kind of a shame that the actual resolution of the output isn't higher but at the same time to help you visualize how impressive this is you know those holographic bookmarks you get where when you look from different angles you can see the same Time: 16:40 - 16:50 image from like four different perspectives this is kind of like that but instead of there being four different perspectives it feels like an unlimited number of perspectives like Time: 16:50 - 17:00 it's literally 100 on top of the fact that it's actually a moving screen but there is also a level up to this so this program is also connected to chat gbt and can apparently allow you to talk to Time: 17:00 - 17:10 AI connected to a holographic character within this Frame right so if I select the robot well now ain't that just a hot tamale of Technology spill the beans and Time: 17:10 - 17:20 let's have a hooden NY this is weird so this thing has the intelligence of the AI models that we know but it's actually also able to communicate that within its own pre- programmed Time: 17:20 - 17:30 personality I'm like shaking a little bit you got it partner if x + 69 is 72 what is X well hot diggity Time: 17:30 - 17:40 dog if x + 69 is 72 then I reckon X is a sneaky little vmit trying to hide in plain sight what but fear not partner Time: 17:40 - 17:50 cuz this old cartoon Android is quick on the draw if we subtract 69 from 72 we find that X is a mischievous Little Critter equal to three what a weird way Time: 17:50 - 18:00 of saying three what's your favorite Mr Who's The Boss video well ain't that a Nutty question no it does feel like a bit of a demo piece in its current form um in Time: 18:00 - 18:10 that it's not a final product with a particular purpose but equally I am shocked right now my brain is spinning with all the things this could Time: 18:10 - 18:20 potentially mean for the future like like imagine if you had like a table with this technology and you were playing holographic board games with the person sitting opposite you each of you having a different Viewpoint of the same Time: 18:20 - 18:30 situation oh my God this is a 10 out of 10 this is a taste of the future a solid 10 out of 10 partner trippy as hell Time: 18:30 - 18:40 right one of the things that I think about a lot when it comes to the future is how language barriers just won't be a thing Tech will be able to make it so that you can still have completely seamless conversations with people who Time: 18:40 - 18:50 otherwise you would never have understood it's just a question of when so are these that product that can take us there okay so drisha you are a Spanish speaker well you have spoken Time: 18:50 - 19:00 Spanish at some point in your life yeah this is going to test my high school Spanish High School Spanish okay that's good enough so you put one earbud in I'm going to put the other earbud in and there's a mode here we're going to click Time: 19:00 - 19:10 called simil mode hello how are you today gra you're hearing what I'm saying can I have a loaf of bread please what's it Time: 19:10 - 19:20 saying to you that's what it comes up as oh my God okay so this is not completely new tech like it's not Time: 19:20 - 19:30 dissimilar in Translation ability to something like Google translate but it's the form factor it's the fact that I can have one airb you can have one a bird and the microphone is really close to your mouth so it picks up the sound well Time: 19:30 - 19:40 and then it's the app it's the app that doesn't require you to keep pressing buttons it just listens out and allows you to have that conversation in real time we've used the Google app a few times to try and talk to people who Time: 19:40 - 19:50 don't talk English and it's kind of like tap wait tap wait when you're using Google translate you very much feel like you're using an app here you just feel like you're looking at the person and Time: 19:50 - 20:00 talking to the person yeah and I can see this slowly being added into things like glasses Apple Vision to make it seem more seamless as opposed to like going on holiday and giving it to someone that Time: 20:00 - 20:10 is such a good point of course that's going to happen could be really cool it's a good enough product that this is going straight in my travel bag and it Time: 20:10 - 20:20 can also do 40 languages and 93 accents right now the two things I don't like are that one the app tries to charge you for downloading languages offline which when you're in abroad countries is Time: 20:20 - 20:30 probably a likely thing you're going to have to do and then also the actual Hardware construction feels a little bit cheap for the price these are like if they were just normal earphones you would expect them to cost no more than Time: 20:30 - 20:40 like $50 for a build like this so overall it's an eight time for The Meta glasses which obviously I mean they're not a cheap product but at the same time given how expensive a normal pair of Time: 20:40 - 20:50 glasses from this company is and how far ahead the metag glasses supposedly are I was expecting this to be much more okay so let's be very clear what this isn't is some completely straight out of a Time: 20:50 - 21:00 movie pair of augmented reality glasses where like I can see you and then like your name and your age next to you we're not there yet but what it is is a pair Time: 21:00 - 21:10 of real and rather stylish glasses or sunglasses that you can put onto your face connect to your phone and make phone tasks more seamless than they already were like music they've got Time: 21:10 - 21:20 speakers that angle down into your ears and okay I mean there's not exactly an established scale for how good glasses should sound but I would say the audio quality is not far off something like Time: 21:20 - 21:30 the third gen airpods you control things using this capacitive area on the side here like scrolling volume for example and then there's a capture button up top for the cameras for both photo and video Time: 21:30 - 21:40 you can also use voice commands but I mean imagine standing in a packed train like meta take a photo here's the thing that shocked me Time: 21:40 - 21:50 the photos and videos that you take on this are actually good it's not quite like topend smartphone but this thing takes 12 map photos and 1080p videos Time: 21:50 - 22:00 using some of the same processing techniques that your smartphone uses like HDR like the stabilization so you don't get Overexposed Skies or everything covered in Shadow like I Time: 22:00 - 22:10 expected coming into this the key downside for me though is that the camera is not going to cover your entire vision and you can't preview what it's capturing like you can on your phone so Time: 22:10 - 22:20 it will sometimes result in a situation where you shoot something you later realize before you post it that actually you want to crop it a little bit to make it central but then at that point it's actually more effort than if you had Time: 22:20 - 22:30 just taken your phone out in the moment and done it properly but I do want to stress this is exciting it's the first product in its category that's actually I would say delivered on its promise and Time: 22:30 - 22:40 feels like a polished finished product that you could see yourself using so I would give this a nine and now moving further up the ladder the concept of this next one is absolutely Bonk as if Time: 22:40 - 22:50 it works a speaker that can focus its sound in one area is like the entire perks of the isolation you get with headphones combined with the free of being able to listen to something by Time: 22:50 - 23:00 speakers and actually while we're at it let's just do this at the same time as the ferrofluid speaker since unlike the name suggests it's not actually a speaker but it's designed to react to a speaker it's hard for me to describe how Time: 23:00 - 23:10 excited I actually am for this this is one of those very big moments where I'm actually experienced something for the first time that could be groundbreaking test and I want to start by saying this Time: 23:10 - 23:20 ferrofluid thing over here even without how it reacts to music just using a magnet over it is fascinating it's basically a magnetic fluid but because you never really see magnets in fluid form it almost shows you magnetism in Time: 23:20 - 23:30 action in a way that's much more real than you all have ever seen with solids that said the actual product feels like it needs a bit of quality control like there's some ferof fluid just stuck to Time: 23:30 - 23:40 the inside of the glass it's LED back lip oh my God it's responding to my voice I have never in my life seen Time: 23:40 - 23:50 anything like that before okay so we'll put that there and now the focus sound this is a very weird piece of technology it genuinely looks like nothing is going on in here it's a Time: 23:50 - 24:00 really light completely clear speaker with just a little bit of a metal body so I imagine almost all of the audio processing and the actual Tech is happening in this box here this is just Time: 24:00 - 24:10 the projector for the sound okay immediate first impression right now it's firing directly at me it's not the most Bassy or Punchy speaker but I can hear it very clearly I'm going to turn Time: 24:10 - 24:20 it away now oh my goodness oh my God I had never experienced anything like that in my life so when you're Time: 24:20 - 24:30 looking directly at the speaker you're convinced The Sound Source is here but as soon as you rotate it it feels like it's almost throwing the audio source to that wall there or that wall there so Time: 24:30 - 24:40 when you turn the speaker away from you it's not like it completely mutes it but you're probably hearing it at about 25% of the volume versus when it's facing you so how well the way that normal Time: 24:40 - 24:50 soundwaves work is they travel out in all directions until they dissipate imagine like throwing a rock into a p and seeing those ripples come out of it Time: 24:50 - 25:00 but this directional audio speaker actually instead uses ultrasonic waves which are super high frequency and therefore much shorter wavelength which means they spread out much less they're Time: 25:00 - 25:10 completely inaudible to the human ear but the thing is as soon as they come into contact with the Human air they distort back into an audible frequency so the target can hear the audio but the other people around them can't as much Time: 25:10 - 25:20 is it worth buying I'd say probably not yet given that you're having to give up a lot of sound quality to be able to get this effect but but the potential is massive so for the purposes of being Time: 25:20 - 25:30 futuristic that's a 9 out of 10 and this ferof fluid speaker surprisingly cool this is an eight this is the airwheel SR5 the auto following suitcase and then Time: 25:30 - 25:40 this is the SE 3s which is the ridable suitcase I actually really fancy a sit right now so we're going to start with the ridable one and I got to say I don't Time: 25:40 - 25:50 think I've ever wanted to like a product this much like okay when in your life have you ever seen this before Time: 25:50 - 26:00 bombastic side eye there's a massive power bank attached to the back of it which means that you can plug your phone in to charge it and then you sit down on Time: 26:00 - 26:10 the thing and I mean come I mean when you think about what riding around on a Suitcase looks like I don't think you'd imagine this level of speed and turning torque this is Time: 26:10 - 26:20 literally like Rainbow Road in Mario Kart wo you got one toggle that's accelerate you got one toggle that's a break but the best bit is what happens Time: 26:20 - 26:30 when you press both together this is how you go through airport securitya you've got the app for this suitcase yeah I can see how fast you're how fast am I going you're joking it feels a lot faster than Time: 26:30 - 26:40 that what TR stop this is really weird oh it just Time: 26:40 - 26:50 says God uh D out okay yeah so on one hand right nothing beats this but then on the Time: 26:50 - 27:00 other hand as a functioning suitcase there's a room for improvement so I mean for starters they make you carry around this ridiculous Time: 27:00 - 27:10 butt pad which really they could have just baked into [Music] it I don't know what kind of holiday you can pack for in there at a squeeze Time: 27:10 - 27:20 that's two shoes and maybe a butt Pad Plus like the website for this thing is so atrocious that I have no faith that any other the tech in this is actually going to last and then we have the autof Time: 27:20 - 27:30 following suitcase this is the one that from a technical perspective I was actually looking forward to more but it's actually quite a lot worse so it Time: 27:30 - 27:40 has very similar perks to the other one in that because it's got a massive battery Bank it can charge your phone it's actually also got a biometric fingerprint scanner for unlocking but the key differentiator is this wrist Time: 27:40 - 27:50 wrap so this wrist strap essentially communicates with this sensor via Ultra wideband which is like the same technology that your iPhone uses to find your air tags for example so I am now connected which means if I walk more Time: 27:50 - 28:00 than 5 meters away then like an overly attached child it will come sprinting to me can it outrun me that's the question oh Time: 28:00 - 28:10 nearly obstacle avoidance on point so this is part of what my problem with the product is these two down here are infrared obstacle avoidance sensors Time: 28:10 - 28:20 they're not very good at avoiding obstacles do you trust the technology with your life go go go BR it slowed down so the problem is not Time: 28:20 - 28:30 that it's unimpressive it's actually pretty cool that it works most of the time it's just that for your most valuable possessions it has to be 100% and it doesn't feel like from what I've Time: 28:30 - 28:40 used it that I trust it completely there are a couple of safeguards in place like for example as soon as you lose it your wrist starts beeping and your suitcase just starts wandering around and around like that looking for the sensor but Time: 28:40 - 28:50 still you only have to lose something once and I feel like this will do it 5 out of 10 right right it's magic mirror time so I started using this thing a couple of Time: 28:50 - 29:00 days ago and it's a really unique product but I think the best way to show you is to actually start a workout and you'll see how it works and I will say they have got the fundamentals right like the software feels very slick it Time: 29:00 - 29:10 runs at a good frame rate although just because of what the product is you do get this slight ghosting type effect it's almost like it's an infinity mirror of bouncing back and forwards which reduces the crispness a little bit so Time: 29:10 - 29:20 the first thing you do is you pick a class so you can either pick it based on the duration you can pick it on who's leading that class or you can pick it based on what body part you feel like working out it's got a whole load of Time: 29:20 - 29:30 different settings you can play around with and what I like about it is that it's not assuming that you have access to an entire gym Suite it's very much able to tweak itself around what you do have and now we go and now it Time: 29:30 - 29:40 initializes body tracking it's just making sure there's one person and one person only in the frame so when I saw this for the first time I will say as a fan of Technology this felt pretty cool Time: 29:40 - 29:50 you've got all these Fitness instructors who've clearly filmed themselves on a green screen background so they've been able to cut it all out and almost appear like they holographically there in your room but it actually gets cooler cuz you Time: 29:50 - 30:00 click right here and you have access to music and every bit of music outputed by this mirror is generated by AI so every time you do a workout you are hearing Time: 30:00 - 30:10 different tracks and then part of why that helps is that you can separate the music volume from the speech and sound effects volumes because yes it talks to you like let's say I am actually following along to this workout it will Time: 30:10 - 30:20 tell me off when I'm doing it wrong bring the weight up to your shoulders right so is it good well there's a lot of things I like about it I like the fact that it gamifies workouts I like Time: 30:20 - 30:30 the fact that it feels like there's almost a watchful eye over you so that you have some company and it does smart things like when you first input the weights that you're lifting it will Time: 30:30 - 30:40 slowly use artificial intelligence to amp up the workouts to make sure that you're progressing the bone that I have to pick though is with the way it's marketed this thing calls itself a personal trainer replacement but really Time: 30:40 - 30:50 what this is is an oversized smartphone with a front camera with a screen with a set of speakers that does use intelligent software to watch you but it Time: 30:50 - 31:00 can't see every angle and you can obviously trick this if you want to like it currently says I've done seven BP curls I haven't done seven bicep curls 2 plus 2 is four this isn't a complete Time: 31:00 - 31:10 replacement for a personal trainer but it is really good for people who don't have access to one so 8 out of 10 you know cycling used to be such a massive part of my life growing up and so this Time: 31:10 - 31:20 idea of me revisiting it now but using something that looks like it's straight out of Tron legacy is kind of crazy okay we have to talk about this product Time: 31:20 - 31:30 is it futuristic yes hell yes this thing is straight out of my bike driving fantasies from when I was a kid like for example it has a kickstand that no joke once activated can only be deactivated Time: 31:30 - 31:40 with fingerprint access it's got a microchip inside of it that will alert your phone if it ever gets stolen and it will give you the exact GPS coordinates to go find it it's got integrated signal Time: 31:40 - 31:50 and brake lights so you don't have to wave your arms around like this when you're gesturing that you want to turn right and then also headlamps that are sensitive to the light in the en so they only turn on when they're needed and all of this stuff is great like using Tech Time: 31:50 - 32:00 to make the biking experience safer that's exactly what it needs and then you have the elephant in the room hubless Wheels how is it that every single bike you've seen up until this Time: 32:00 - 32:10 point has a Hub in the middle but this one doesn't well they've actually not really done away with the Hub you still need one they've just redesigned it and relocated it so that everything that was previously Happening Here is now Time: 32:10 - 32:20 happening in a combination of here and then here does it have any practical benefit at all no it doesn't and that brings me on to the problem the whole thing is very surface level Time: 32:20 - 32:30 like it's very heavy it's got this really cheap feeling plastic coating that we actually ended up accidentally scratching earlier just trying to clean it as far as the actual electric bike performance it's really nothing special Time: 32:30 - 32:40 like it's nothing better than what you could get on a $1,000 or maybe even $700 electric bike the thing has basically no suspension every single bump you go over Time: 32:40 - 32:50 you feel it but by far the worst part of this is the tech is basically dysfunctional we couldn't get the app to connect we couldn't get any of the smart features to work customer service Time: 32:50 - 33:00 non-existent the company doesn't even seem to be properly operational anymore making this essentially the most expensive prop I've ever bought in my life and I'm really upset to be Time: 33:00 - 33:10 honest $4,600 that's where we're at right now and for that well this Diablo robot really has to be something special right Time: 33:10 - 33:20 let's just get one thing out the way this is a very impressive product like it's one thing to be able to balance as a human but to achieve that in a two-legged machine that requires very Time: 33:20 - 33:30 high intelligence it requires the robot to be able to constantly know exactly where its limbs are and also be able to correct itself in an instant the second something moves out of syn you know when Time: 33:30 - 33:40 you move it it feels so powerful like it could take me out if I accidentally oh God I'm actually a bit scared now I'm not sure in my life I've Time: 33:40 - 33:50 ever used a piece of Robotics that feels this powerful so this is making me think of a couple of month ago where I tested this for the first time it's a DJI Robo Time: 33:50 - 34:00 master and I genuinely thought at the time this is as Extreme as toys get but that makes this very much look like Child's Play but also it can jump you Time: 34:00 - 34:10 ready oh my goodness me let's do a backwards Time: 34:10 - 34:20 jump which all begs the question why like what is this for and the way I see it the best use of a robot that can't seem to fall fall over is to carry stuff right so the mission Coke on the robot Time: 34:20 - 34:30 and I'm going to try and deliver that coke to drer on the chair everyone's telling me not to do this she's watching with baited breath this is absolutely phenomenal okay you Time: 34:30 - 34:40 ready just swipe it you got it you got it you got it you got it you got it yes other thing we need to test here is carrying capacity so you can maximize it by going into the creeping mode as Time: 34:40 - 34:50 opposed to the standing mode uh I probably shouldn't get on prish it works do you want to have a race just Time: 34:50 - 35:00 going to give you a morph strap for when I Blaze ahead of you should be on you so that you can catch me winning no no no no no Time: 35:00 - 35:10 no [Music] yes oh how do you stop oh oh and the final added benefit is we now have a new Time: 35:10 - 35:20 robot to control our camera shots wow this is abs absolutely insane this robot's got to be a nine at nearly Time: 35:20 - 35:30 $110,000 then welcome to world's first ever mass produced transparent TV and actually now we're here I do just want Time: 35:30 - 35:40 to show you one more thing you might have heard me talking about when we overtake apple and subscribers we're going to build this massive iPhone unlike the world has ever seen well essentially we've started building it we're working with another YouTuber Time: 35:40 - 35:50 called DIY perks the guy who made that crazy phone shelf what oh my and long story short it's going to be mindblowing like just Time: 35:50 - 36:00 to give you an idea the camera on the phone is an actual proper DSLR camera and that's just the icing on the cake we're closing in on Apple but we just need a little bit of help getting there so if you enjoy our videos at all and Time: 36:00 - 36:10 you want to see this masterpiece of a foam come together then a sub to the channel would be transformative all right so the TV Time: 36:10 - 36:20 itself I mean this is every bit as cool and futuristic as I was hoping it would be it's basically like a normal TV you've got a layer of glass a trans ucent layer of OLED pixels then another layer of glass except that the way the Time: 36:20 - 36:30 blacks are represented is by transparency and insanely cool as that is it does create a bit of a paradox when you're watching content like for example if it does what a TV does best Time: 36:30 - 36:40 and produces really bright vibrant striking visuals then it's not doing a very good job of being a transparent TV and if it does a very good job of being a transparent TV then it's doing a less good job than a non-transparent TV the Time: 36:40 - 36:50 limitations are very obvious like how paired back the resolution had to be this is only a 1080p screen which stretched out on a 55in panel is not the Time: 36:50 - 37:00 sharpest but that doesn't mean I'm not glad this exists like combine this Tech with electrochromic glass which is what tinted windows use to tint themselves and you maybe do actually have something Time: 37:00 - 37:10 big on your hands this isn't a practical TV but I mean the way I'm looking at it it's kind of a piece of art so I'm going to give it a seven all right just before night time where we test the orb I want to show you our final futuristic Gadget Time: 37:10 - 37:20 this is the insta 360 X3 camera see here's the thing in most major cities trying to use a drone to get cinematic shots of the city is strictly prohibited Time: 37:20 - 37:30 but drones are not the only way to get drone like footage get one of these X3 cameras stick it onto one of the company's 3 m invisible selfie sticks and the camera basically uses some very Time: 37:30 - 37:40 clever software trickery to remove that selfie stick from the image giving the impression of a floating camera that follows you around at all times it's quite funny actually it's become this whole Trend like you can literally go on Time: 37:40 - 37:50 to Instagram now and search no drone no problem and you will see thousands of people who've taken stuff like this and you would actually be hardpressed to tell that it's not taken on a high-end drone and here is my attempt at the same Time: 37:50 - 38:00 thing that is pretty cool and if you want to try it for yourself I have got us basically the best deal that you can get in the description right now with a Time: 38:00 - 38:10 10% discount off the product a 128 GB SD card and the invisible selfie stick you need to actually take shots like this okay it's biow time and we can't see Time: 38:10 - 38:20 anything so far of note it just looks a little yellow but if we turn the light off you can't see anything now out but now I'm going to shake Time: 38:20 - 38:30 it oh my God that's amazing it seems like they react to motion to a human eye it's very impressive but then I suppose how often are you going to sit there rotating your bulb I'll give it a six Time: 38:30 - 38:40If this is what is called futuristic, I'm pretty damn excited about the future!

00:20 just not in a good way i was actually sitting here in this crowd when they showed to the world lg chloe one robot to manage your entire Time: 00:20 - 00:30 home and never in my life have i seen excitement turn into so much cringe i want to disappear into my chair this quickly am i ready on my washer and Time: 00:30 - 00:40 cycle he asked a question to it and for five of the longest seconds of my entire life the whole audience just sat there eyes wide waiting to see what this next generation of robots was about to do Time: 00:40 - 00:50 we're still waiting but it only started to get really awkward when he then tried again for a second time chloe what's for dinner tonight Time: 00:50 - 01:00 fair play to the guy on stage he tried to play it off like the robot was just angry at him but by the time he got blanked for the third time chloe are you talking to me yet what recipes could i make with chicken Time: 01:00 - 01:10 the entire audience was just laughing so i'm giving lg chloe a 2 out of 10 on the failed scale now when i say the Time: 01:10 - 01:20 word smartphone to you what do you think of some sort of rectangular glass sandwich right well the runcible is what you get when you defy that convention or really Time: 01:20 - 01:30 to be more specific it's what you get when you defy every convention it was world's first circular smartphone it ditched glass construction for wood it was even fully user upgradable for Time: 01:30 - 01:40 sustainability it's just it couldn't make phone calls if you look at the small print on the website they refer to it as a very small tablet which is fine but Time: 01:40 - 01:50 what kind of tablet content am i going to consume on a 2.5 inch circular display 2 out of 10. anyways did you know that in 2016 Time: 01:50 - 02:00 microsoft created a twitter account that used artificial intelligence to learn how to talk like a human they called her tay and they said to people the more you talk to her Time: 02:00 - 02:10 the smarter she becomes well in 24 hours tay was tweeting some of the most horrific racial slurs on the platform when she was created she started off by Time: 02:10 - 02:20 saying humans were super cool and how she was stoked to meet us but in less than one day she was trying to start a race war i'm not even exaggerating Time: 02:20 - 02:30 she was swearing she was quoting hitler because she was learning from every single conversation the wider population started abusing that teaching her to say things which were just completely out of order tay was Time: 02:30 - 02:40 sophisticated enough to to pick up how humans talked but she wasn't sophisticated enough to know when she was being led on and so within 24 hours of being up Time: 02:40 - 02:50 tay was cancelled which feels like a pretty good general summary of twitter right now and a pretty alarming example of why we've got to be so careful with how much power we give to ai so pretty easy 3 out of 10 Time: 02:50 - 03:00 fail for this one and by the way this video was sponsored by huell got something pretty cool to show you at the end for this okay in late 2019 Time: 03:00 - 03:10 a very excited elon musk walks on stage to show the world cybertruck can you imagine being in this audience with no idea what's coming no leaks no images Time: 03:10 - 03:20 and then watching as this thing rolls onto stage people were going wild i've never seen this many audience members trying to take a photo at the exact same time the only slight hitch though was that Time: 03:20 - 03:30 they spent a good portion of this event talking about how strong the cyber truck was they said it had a virtually impenetrable exoskeleton they said the glass was practically bulletproof Time: 03:30 - 03:40 except when they actually tested it oh my god they broke it and they then did what seems to be a common theme here they tried again they picked up the same Time: 03:40 - 03:50 ball this time threw it at the rear window and they broke that too and of course this clip became the most viewed video about the cyber truck by a long Time: 03:50 - 04:00 shot there are still plenty of people who are excited about this car but that was awkward okay let's do a rapid fire round for google here three fails three minutes let's go so Time: 04:00 - 04:10 first of all was the nexus q it was a media streamer basically a way for your phone to display content on your tv think chromecast only worse Time: 04:10 - 04:20 it was wildly expensive at 300 it could only stream google content like google play music which is also dead and the new york times described this as wildly overbuilt Time: 04:20 - 04:30 for its limited functions which is not the kind of review that any brand wants but even more disappointing was google glass because unlike the nexus q which just Time: 04:30 - 04:40 kind of came out of nowhere and then flopped people were excited about glass google made trailers like this showing us the world that we were about to step into they showed four people wearing glass Time: 04:40 - 04:50 jumping out of a plane whilst all still having a google hangouts chat however there is such thing as being too early google was trying to merge the digital and the physical worlds Time: 04:50 - 05:00 before the tech was really able to and so for almost everything it could do it just had a massive asterisk next to it you can probably imagine then that this whole concept of dropping fifteen Time: 05:00 - 05:10 hundred dollars to effectively beta test a product that did everything your phone did but worse did not sit well with the average consumer and the final google blunder at least Time: 05:10 - 05:20 for this video is stadia i remember watching this thing get announced this whole idea of you being able to just watch some gameplay on youtube and if you like the look of it click one button and jump into that game yourself Time: 05:20 - 05:30 all being powered by your internet browser with no downloads and no console needed i remember nearly spitting my drink out all over my keyboard because whoa it's just trying to stream a game Time: 05:30 - 05:40 has a lot more complications than trying to stream a movie or a song most notably input lag think about it for every single time i press a key on my controller Time: 05:40 - 05:50 that command has to be transmitted wirelessly to my computer it's then got to find its way all the way towards the servers that are hosting this game which we're often not close at all process that command to produce an Time: 05:50 - 06:00 output and then send that next frame all the way back down to my computer so that i can see what's happening next or to put it in a more visual way this is kind of what the gameplay looked like Time: 06:00 - 06:10 and this is on a high speed internet connection info lag was only one of stadia's many problems but we do need to cover other things in this video too like the wii u oh Time: 06:10 - 06:20 made it thank you you remember the wii right that console even though it was about as powerful as my fridge it changed gaming forever it was the Time: 06:20 - 06:30 first time that i'd ever seen three-year-old kids playing the same games as their 70 year old grandparents with both groups loving it so it's kind of crazy that nintendo Time: 06:30 - 06:40 could go straight from highs like this to lows like this six years after the wii they decided it was time for its next-gen successor a console that you could just play normally Time: 06:40 - 06:50 on your tv but also with the option to play the entire games using just this new controller with its built-in screen so other people could use the tv at the same time i don't think it was a Time: 06:50 - 07:00 terrible idea it's just it was executed with all the elegance of a galaxy note 7 moments before explosion there were plenty of issues but i'd say Time: 07:00 - 07:10 the primary culprit is just the fact that they called it the wii u what does that even mean and more importantly doesn't that just make it sound like it's an add-on for the existing wii even cnn's first Time: 07:10 - 07:20 impressions article of the wii u called it a solid accessory that's the equivalent of saying the playstation 5 is a solid accessory to the playstation Time: 07:20 - 07:30 4. cnn so easy 5 out of 10 fail here the wii u was a colossal flop and to be honest if nintendo hadn't turned things around with the switch that came after Time: 07:30 - 07:40 this could have been the beginning of the end for them but as we've learned from these videos you can always do worse so in 2012 this little box was going viral imagine Time: 07:40 - 07:50 this lady telling you that she was creating a console called the ouya that for just 99 could play tens of thousands of games including minecraft platformers shooters mostly Time: 07:50 - 08:00 for free you'd be pretty excited i mean just the idea of a console at that kind of price is unheard of and so it's almost not surprising that ouya became the second most funded project on Time: 08:00 - 08:10 kickstarter with almost nine million dollars behind it but when we have finally shipped it became very clear that its biggest perceived strength was also kind of its biggest weakness Time: 08:10 - 08:20 because it was based on android yes you were getting tens of thousands of games but what was kind of glossed over was the fact that these were fundamentally games made for Time: 08:20 - 08:30 phones at the time in 2012 very few of them had good controller support most of them were just kind of cheaply made with in-app purchases plus when you blow up games that were made Time: 08:30 - 08:40 for a four-inch 2012 phone screen to a 40-inch tv people quickly realized that even calling this a current gen console was really a push already now for the smart Time: 08:40 - 08:50 home or in this case the not very smart home picture this it's 2013. sony's just announced the playstation 4. people are showing off their iphone 5cs Time: 08:50 - 09:00 jokes on them really and you feel like making a change in your life well luckyview juicero has come up with a machine that can squeeze you your very own fresh Time: 09:00 - 09:10 fruit juices if you buy the machine for seven hundred dollars and then pay a subscription to get these sachets of cut up fruit to use with it do you wanna know the funny bit though Time: 09:10 - 09:20 you didn't need the machine bloomberg posted a one minute video showing how they could actually get the exact same juice but faster by squeezing the sachets by hand and this one minute video Time: 09:20 - 09:30 pretty much brought down the entire operation and if you are enjoying this video then a sub to the channel would be juicy but now is where it starts to get Time: 09:30 - 09:40 dangerous there's a company called june they make smart ovens and they have genuinely turned what can often be a pretty gross appliance into a piece of art but people quickly Time: 09:40 - 09:50 found out that their june ovens at least the first generation of them could spontaneously turn themselves on and start heating up imagine sitting on your bed at 2am in the middle of the Time: 09:50 - 10:00 night and suddenly your oven just randomly hits 200 degrees celsius in the kitchen below with no one there to oversee it that's that's kind of scary if there was any food still left in there Time: 10:00 - 10:10 or even really scraps from past meals that could be enough to start a house fire june did fix this with a software update yikes you know what's the level above that the Time: 10:10 - 10:20 amazon ring security system no literally a security system that puts people at risk good job amazon see what happened was these cameras allowed Time: 10:20 - 10:30 users to fully see and hear what's happening in any room at any time and sure that's incredibly useful but because such high level access was only protected by a simple username and Time: 10:30 - 10:40 password they could be hacked imagine just sitting there in your living room with your family when all of a sudden you hear a voice coming through your security camera Time: 10:40 - 10:50 pay this 50 bitcoin ransom or else you will get terminated yourself right now and you realize that this entire time someone's been watching you it sounds like something straight out of Time: 10:50 - 11:00 a horror movie and what makes this worse is that these hackers would threaten and sometimes even blackmail the families they were looking at there was one famous incident where there was an old lady in an apartment Time: 11:00 - 11:10 and a voice said to her tonight you'd die oh yeah and also the amazon ring smart doorbells the accompanying product to the cameras they Time: 11:10 - 11:20 started spontaneously bursting into flames so quite the duo i mean obviously this wasn't amazon's fault and they did address it with a software update but what a horrendous oversight okay do Time: 11:20 - 11:30 you remember when segways and hoverboards were like the coolest thing on the planet how it finally felt like we'd figured out a solution to walking Time: 11:30 - 11:40 where do they go well we found out the hard way that segways we're dangerous you lose focus for just one second and you're either in a ditch Time: 11:40 - 11:50 a road or you've already knocked someone over even the president of the united states was seen falling off one of these and this right here shows when a cameraman managed to plow straight into Time: 11:50 - 12:00 usain bolt the world's fastest sprinter or at least he was before that it's actually kind of sad you know the owner of the segway company in 2010 Time: 12:00 - 12:10 he actually drove a segway off a cliff and he died you know i was actually going to make an entrance to this video on a segway but then partway through doing it the battery ran out and i fell nearly phase Time: 12:10 - 12:20 first on the ground they're dangerous and so it's not really surprising that a lot of governments got involved and basically started banning their use in public spaces Time: 12:20 - 12:30 and what really didn't help is that many of these supposed hoverboards which let's be honest were just boards they started catching on fire half a million of them had to be recalled Time: 12:30 - 12:40 which let's face it that's enough to ruin any potentially up-and-coming product so this is definitely a seven out of ten territory and that leaves us with a few major Time: 12:40 - 12:50 social media fails leading up to the big number one and we'll start with our good friends at facebook okay it's 2018. facebook has just had one of the biggest Time: 12:50 - 13:00 data breaches of all time affecting 50 million users not to mention arguably the biggest tech scam of the decade where users data was extracted from facebook to be used for political advertising Time: 13:00 - 13:10 what a great time to launch a massive facebook branded always-on camera screen and microphone to sit in people's homes they called it Time: 13:10 - 13:20 the facebook portal it wasn't good in fact it was actually referred to as the worst tech device of the year and it was kind of a turning point for a lot of people who realized that Time: 13:20 - 13:30 they did not trust facebook and what makes it worse is that in an interview less than six months later mark zuckerberg himself when trying to give an example of what would be considered Time: 13:30 - 13:40 going too far when it comes to the invasion of privacy he said we definitely don't want a society where there's a camera in everyone's living room and while we're at it with facebook you might remember that recent january Time: 13:40 - 13:50 whatsapp update they came completely out of the blue with a notification saying that their terms of service had been updated but they could have worded this a little Time: 13:50 - 14:00 better what it came across as was that this update allowed whatsapp to share its data with facebook and people were furious because of course the implication was that Time: 14:00 - 14:10 even when you think you're having a private chat with someone that data is not just not private but it's actually going to be used to give you even more scarily accurate adverts now given the Time: 14:10 - 14:20 reputation that facebook already had at this point they did not need this millions of users started boycotting whatsapp and millions not just uninstalled it but Time: 14:20 - 14:30 went to competing apps like signal and got their entire social group to do the same fun fact i actually got asked to be on radio here in the uk just to talk to people about the best apps they could switch to and Time: 14:30 - 14:40 whatsapp did come out afterwards and say hey guys it was a misunderstanding we didn't mean to do that we don't share data with facebook but that almost makes it more of a fail Time: 14:40 - 14:50 they nuked a massive part of their user base just because they couldn't structure their sentences clearly so that puts this indefinite seven out Time: 14:50 - 15:00 of ten territory and then we've got youtube we've got a lot to be grateful for on youtube i mean they're the only reason that i'm able to sit here and talk to you like this it's amazing but the one thing that i Time: 15:00 - 15:10 think we can agree isn't is rewind so it's become a bit of a tradition that once per year youtube creates a mashup of the most memorable moments that happened on Time: 15:10 - 15:20 youtube and people used to love it just being able to see your favorite influencers who never normally would have interacted dancing together in a room Time: 15:20 - 15:30 it's like a really fun version of an award ceremony but youtube has progressively killed that sentiment instead of the usual 95 like to dislike ratio Time: 15:30 - 15:40 as soon as we hit 2016 people started disliking rewind this video had something like 87 likes which is enough to know that something's off but then 2017 had 68 Time: 15:40 - 15:50 likes and 2018 had 13.8 likes and it's still the most disliked video on the entire internet how does youtube Time: 15:50 - 16:00 themselves go that wrong well it seems like the answer is that they've become disconnected from their creators like this 2018 rewind it Time: 16:00 - 16:10 started with will smith who youtube probably got in there because they thought well this will make us seem legit fortnite and marquez brownlee but actually Time: 16:10 - 16:20 everyone watching this was just thinking why is will smith actor in a youtube rewind and the whole video just went on about a bunch of stuff that was kind of significant but it ignored Time: 16:20 - 16:30 an alarming amount of the really big stuff maybe youtube just wants youtube to seem like a really family-friendly platform and so they skipped over all the drama Time: 16:30 - 16:40 and the controversy but as far as the viewer and as far as the creators are concerned that's what makes youtube youtube and so rewind starts to feel less like a Time: 16:40 - 16:50 one-off super special video that everyone got amped up for more just like a feel-good pg-rated trailer for youtube as a service and don't even get me started on the 2019 rewind which Time: 16:50 - 17:00 was just a countdown of videos that did well and the 2021 it didn't actually happen so you know it feels like everyone under Time: 17:00 - 17:10 the age of 30 is on instagram and tick tock right now well in some alternate universe they'd all be on an app called quibby it stands for quick bytes and it was meant to be the netflix Time: 17:10 - 17:20 for the up and coming generation where it was still big budget content but capped at 10 minutes in length the idea being that more and more we're consuming content in Time: 17:20 - 17:30 shorter bursts we are less about now sitting down for two hours at a time watching an entire film more about spending 10 minutes here watching a couple of tick tock videos Time: 17:30 - 17:40 spending 10 minutes here flicking through an instagram feed so this was quality tv built to replace that time and it was packing heat it was led by Time: 17:40 - 17:50 meg whitman ex-ceo of hp and jeffrey katzenberg chairman of walt disney studios and together these guys managed to raise 1.7 billion Time: 17:50 - 18:00 dollars in funding the failure came though because this was like an older person's view of what younger people want it was built for the 20 to 35 age group Time: 18:00 - 18:10 but by people who are over 60 what they needed to do was to get those same youtubers and tick tockers that this generation was engaging with to create special high production value Time: 18:10 - 18:20 content for them but what they actually did was to just get a whole load of a-list hollywood celebrities instead it was a star-studded cast don't get me Time: 18:20 - 18:30 wrong but i think they misjudged their audience and i also think that they somewhat devalued their own product by capping it at 10 minutes because as densely packed with celebrities as these Time: 18:30 - 18:40 videos were we've kind of got used to the idea of not paying for short video so within seven months of launching qibi flopped and with it the 1.7 billion dollars they Time: 18:40 - 18:50 managed to raise gone and to just give you some context on how much money that is it's enough to build a bridge halfway around the world made only of playstation 5 consoles Time: 18:50 - 19:00 yes these are the kinds of examples my brain comes up with but now we are stepping it up another level because in july of last Time: 19:00 - 19:10 year there was a hacking 130 of the most high-profile twitter accounts were hacked in one go we're talking people like barack obama bill gates Time: 19:10 - 19:20 jeff bezos but also youtubers like mr beast even the official apple account but it's worse than that it's not just that these hackers gained access to these guys accounts it's that they actively use them to scam Time: 19:20 - 19:30 their followers what they said to people was if you send us some bitcoin we'll send you back twice as much and because these tweets were coming from verified accounts that people trust Time: 19:30 - 19:40 i guess their audiences must have just thought we've hit the jackpot they were throwing money in their direction and because it's bitcoin we're talking about these transactions are irreversible so which group of Time: 19:40 - 19:50 masterminds came up with this three teenagers and thankfully all they wanted was to earn some quick money because if this was done by someone with more Time: 19:50 - 20:00 malicious intentions with that kind of power the ability to speak on behalf of anyone in the world you could start a war so eight out of Time: 20:00 - 20:10 ten fail for this one now in any list of tech fails made in 2021 we can't not talk about cyberpunk for those of you who don't know about it this was the biggest most hyped video Time: 20:10 - 20:20 game of the entire decade it only just released a couple of months ago but we've been seeing trailers of it since 2013. and sure i mean if it's that Time: 20:20 - 20:30 revolutionary we'll wait seven years after seeing the first trailer but this wasn't that and i don't think anybody would have predicted how badly it was gonna backfire in a Time: 20:30 - 20:40 very best case scenario you got a buggy mess we're talking random teleportations ridiculous graphical glitches people flying through walls and pretty much everything else you can Time: 20:40 - 20:50 think of but worse still if you bought this game on a last gen playstation 4 or xbox one which i imagine most people did then it looked and ran about as good as me after Time: 20:50 - 21:00 ubereats went 50 off and it's not just the fact that when this game launched it wasn't even close to ready it's the fact that the company behind it cd projekt red Time: 21:00 - 21:10 they tried to hide it they restricted access to early copies so reviewers couldn't even warn people so you can probably imagine that when all of this became public their stock price plummeted they got Time: 21:10 - 21:20 demolished on social media they had multiple class-action lawsuits filed against them but the worst bit these guys were maliciously hacked Time: 21:20 - 21:30 and it's tough to say for sure whether this was linked to the game or not but it would be a pretty huge coincidence if not someone got into their service and basically took every bit of secretive data they could Time: 21:30 - 21:40 find info about how the company runs their employees their accounts and even the source code of the game which can be used to create an unlimited number of new copies of it Time: 21:40 - 21:50 and then the hackers sold all that information cyberpunk is the biggest video game disaster that i've ever seen in my life 9 out of 10 fail now we've already seen Time: 21:50 - 22:00 some alarming things on this list some things that might worry you but imagine you're worried if you saw this message pop up on your phone ballistic missile threat Time: 22:00 - 22:10 inbound to hawaii seek immediate shelter this is not a drill this was a message that was sent one day in 2018 to every tv radio and smartphone in hawaii people Time: 22:10 - 22:20 were already on edge as tensions had been mounting for years with north korea and both countries did have nuclear weapons so this was a very Time: 22:20 - 22:30 real threat people must have been losing their minds but it was a mistake the entire thing was just one internal miscommunication in the hawaii emergency Time: 22:30 - 22:40 facility and it took them 38 minutes 38 of probably the most frantic hellish minutes of these hawaiians lives for them to correct it okay just before Time: 22:40 - 22:50 the big number one i do have a full series on this channel just about smartphone fails i'll leave that link down below and let me know if you've got like a favorite tech fail that you'd want to see in the next episode of this series Time: 22:50 - 23:00 so number one and this is the first time that i've ever awarded a fail anything above a 9 out of ten we're talking about thoroughness and all you're thinking not Time: 23:00 - 23:10 thanos let me introduce you to a lady called elizabeth holmes who saw an opportunity in medical tech she realized that the current way blood was Time: 23:10 - 23:20 being tested for diseases and cancers was super inefficient because every single test scientists wanted to do required a separate vial of blood so she Time: 23:20 - 23:30 basically created a machine that could just take one tiny blood sample and with that do over 240 tests on it all at once all at a fraction of the cost this could Time: 23:30 - 23:40 have changed medicine forever this could have changed every single one of our lives this woman was a hero an inspiration she was often referred to as the female steve jobs because of how Time: 23:40 - 23:50 she loved these turtlenecks her company reached a valuation of nine billion dollars think of the ps5 bridge you could build with that Time: 23:50 - 24:00 but it was all founded on lies right from the very beginning this machine did not do what she said it did she claimed to investors that it had been used in the military Time: 24:00 - 24:10 and that it had been used in emergency rooms but it hadn't this theronis company they didn't even themselves use these machines they would tell these investors yeah sure of course we can give you a demo of Time: 24:10 - 24:20 our tech and they would take their blood samples go into a back room and test it using conventional methods come back in and claim their machines had done it so anyone who'd actually used one of these Time: 24:20 - 24:30 machines to get their blood results was very likely misdiagnosed and when you think of the severity of being told that you have cancer when you don't or even worse being told that you don't Time: 24:30 - 24:40 when you do this is bad so bad that the entire company had to shut down so bad that elizabeth holmes is on trial so bad that Time: 24:40 - 24:50 there's an award-winning documentary made about her scam and even apparently an entire feature film in the works with jennifer lawrence playing as her i think this is worthy of a 10 out of 10 Time: 24:50 - 25:00 fail okay by the time i finish this sentence you have watched me make my very own thai green curry that's literally it you get your heel powder you mix it into hot water cover it Time: 25:00 - 25:10 and leave it for five minutes this is not a protein shake or a liquid meal replacement it is an actual meal that you can have for lunch or dinner made from brown rice quinoa pea protein Time: 25:10 - 25:20 flaxseed coconuts just good ingredients and if you didn't know i've actually been having fuel myself for four years before the company actually reached out and wanted to Time: 25:20 - 25:30 sponsor a video because fundamentally it fits well in my life i care about my health but i just don't have the time or arguably the skills to manually cook Time: 25:30 - 25:40 three full meals a day so give it a try i've left a special link below and if you click that link it will not just help to support the channel but if you do decide to buy heel you will get not just the heel but also two Time: 25:40 - 25:50 scoops a pot to cook it in and a free heel t-shirt they are really good t-shirts so thank you so much for watching my name is aaron this is mr who's the boss Time: 25:50 - 26:00 and i'll catch you in the next one Time: 26:00 - 26:10 you Time: 26:10 - 26:20I love how this guy rates a tech fail that could have started a war 8/10 while rating a buggy video game 9/10",

      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:10 you with perfect accuracy yeah five a paint sprayer but one that apparently gives a perfect coat of paint every single time I'm getting tingles just thinking about using this what are Time: 00:10 - 00:20 you this is very elaborate the description says it flows upwards Against Gravity this I have to see I remember fidget Spinners were a huge thing a few years ago I wonder what a Time: 00:20 - 00:30 2022 fidget spinner looks like Wow multi-dimensional Let's get one of those we have animated Spinners now this one's got so many moving Parts I just want it Time: 00:30 - 00:40 in my hands right now why is this one like 50 okay it's luminous it's got listed here as one of the perks fidgeting can burn more calories throughout the day because you're moving more bit of a stretch if you ask me but Time: 00:40 - 00:50 my curiosity is peaked someone's made kind of like a fidget spinner within a fidget spinner that is a true 21st century product Time: 00:50 - 01:00 um who made this and why I've had an idea satisfying magnetic gadgets it's always cool to see just how many products are out there a levitating Time: 01:00 - 01:10 plant okay I mean the levitation is cool it's more the fact that of all things that you could be levitating you picked a plant there's also just a levitating platform that we can put anything on Time: 01:10 - 01:20 killing me right now this company has built a clock that uses a levitating orb as its hand s 800 for a clock okay screw it let's try Time: 01:20 - 01:30 some satisfying kitchen gadgets I mean this would be fantastic for my health transformation yes yes that's what I need an apple corer that can get you Time: 01:30 - 01:40 perfect shaped slices every single time a corn scraper okay we need to get some more of these fruit peely thingies banana slicer my body is ready yeah boy Time: 01:40 - 01:50 okay this isn't cheap but I'm almost just visualizing this idea of spinning this wheel and getting perfectly cut vegetable slices coming out the other Time: 01:50 - 02:00 side I think we have to get it all right I think we've got our kitchen gadgets covered let's try God bedroom whoa Time: 02:00 - 02:10 hmm I did not think that one through so if you ever design a product of your own then this machine the form box it has Time: 02:10 - 02:20 the capacity to be able to duplicate it I can literally remember featuring this product in a video back when the only thing that existed was just a trailer of it but now it is real and we can buy it Time: 02:20 - 02:30 and test it automatic zen garden Sandbar automatic is just how I like my zen it kind of looks like one of those things you could literally watch for hours waiting for it to finish the pattern it's on that's just giving me an idea I Time: 02:30 - 02:40 genuinely think the most satisfying thing I've ever experienced in my entire life is the DVD logo hitting the corner of the screen Time: 02:40 - 02:50 can we buy that DVD logo hits Corner Shopping you can buy a t-shirt with it on it's quite the same okay I'll figure Time: 02:50 - 03:00 out how to recreate that satisfaction by the time we get to the unboxing section of this video mark my words there's a 3D printer that can print chocolate in whatever shape you want yeah this has Time: 03:00 - 03:10 been my whole life on a similar note I've actually been drinking a lot more shakes recently with the whole trying to be healthy thing well instead of needing to shake your drink this thing uses a Time: 03:10 - 03:20 Vortex inside of it to mix it I think it'll be rude not to buy that hand towels that are actually tiny little tablets until they make contact with water yeah I didn't quite know how I got Time: 03:20 - 03:30 here right I have never been so excited for the products to just be here right now it's been two months and I am ready to be satisfied I think I bought a bit too Time: 03:30 - 03:40 much Tech so let's go from the cheapest satisfying gadgets to the most expensive to find out how much it actually costs to get that thrill starting with our Time: 03:40 - 03:50 kitchen gadgets so this is our corn thresher Apple divider and our banana slicer okay fruit me it's corn beautiful little corn we've Time: 03:50 - 04:00 got here you know it would be quite funny as well as if you get like a cinematic shot of the Corn and I'm like what a beautiful specimen okay let's do it oh it's so perfectly formed Time: 04:00 - 04:10 that was incredible that's a seven out of ten this might be the corniest video we've ever made let's get this bananas sliced it's about the least satisfying way to open a banana is fruit peeling an Time: 04:10 - 04:20 ASMR category all right oh my God that's what it's gonna do to the banana through the guillotine are you ready here we go oh Time: 04:20 - 04:30 perfect slices wow easy eight here all right this might be the greatest Apple product of all time oh I'd say Time: 04:30 - 04:40 that was probably more palpitation inducing than satisfying but it did work to be fair that is the quickest I've ever sliced an apple I'll give this one a six so these are a highly cost Time: 04:40 - 04:50 effective way to get your fix but I've heard that kinetic sand can do us one better so this is kind of like moist feeling sand that never dries out that was a great peel they've really Time: 04:50 - 05:00 nailed the unboxing experience okay so I've just put together some almost perfect looking shapes made of kinetic sand Time: 05:00 - 05:10 a sound okay pizza cutter is ah do you see how the sand almost has like a fluffy texture to it okay let's do Time: 05:10 - 05:20 something very strange here that was not what I expected at all it's like a really nice cake has anyone want a corn cookie a bit of a dilemma for Time: 05:20 - 05:30 this last pile do we grate it or do we put it through a garlic press all right screw it let's do both oh and it looks like some very gone off mozzarella let's just shove it in the garlic press see Time: 05:30 - 05:40 what happens this is what my training is leaded to oh God it just looks like droppings we've had our fun now the hand towel tablets I really like Time: 05:40 - 05:50 this bag kind of looks alarmingly like a bag of mints we've got some nice warm water oh my God it literally looks like a mint this has a high probability of being Time: 05:50 - 06:00 incredibly underwhelming but let's try it three two one oh wow that was so fast that did not disappoint I enjoyed that the fact that Time: 06:00 - 06:10 they've managed to get a towel that large into a tablet to that size that's actually a feat of engineering whoops oh Time: 06:10 - 06:20 that is insane but let's ramp this up with the fidget toys I generally think we spent over a hundred dollars on these Spinners let's find out if it was worth it uh this thing is Tiny I'm so excited Time: 06:20 - 06:30 about this one okay this one is heavy duty very odd I've got no idea how this one works that is a cool design right here's Time: 06:30 - 06:40 pendulum the way that this thing moves and catches light is actually mesmerizing okay I think I got it okay so it's kind of just like a normal spinner but a Time: 06:40 - 06:50 little bit more unpredictable six out of ten okay Sonic time wait what he's too fast I'm starting to see Sonic kind of he's Time: 06:50 - 07:00 still a blur I kind of thought this was going to be more like a flip book with the effect it creates ah I'll give that a bite okay this one can't be bad look how many mechanisms it's got Time: 07:00 - 07:10 ah that is amazing the pattern it creates continuously changes as the speed changes look how it catches the light easy eight don't really know what to do with you do you spin it ah oh that Time: 07:10 - 07:20 is nice it feels like an object you shouldn't be able to hold in your hands and then when you start spinning it it's a mess but it always seems to find some sort of equilibrium unexpectedly fun Time: 07:20 - 07:30 seven out of whoa okay so this is what we paid I want to say fifty dollars for it is very weighty and balanced I'll give it that something gonna happen when we spin it Time: 07:30 - 07:40 um okay extremely smooth but not fifty dollars come on okay but at the very least apparently if you spin this one Time: 07:40 - 07:50 the other way around come closer you'll actually hear some music moving on you bought me something Time: 07:50 - 08:00 oh no oh no I hate it even worse in person I don't want to touch it that's so weird let's take it back okay special pen time very Time: 08:00 - 08:10 shiny finish and the really interesting thing about this pen is that when we click the button the entire structure of the pen changes Time: 08:10 - 08:20 I've got no idea how they managed to make it fold up so uniformly but now is stepping up because at forty dollars this is the vortex shaker water and protein powder this really Time: 08:20 - 08:30 doesn't look like it's going to do much but the company says that apparently the combination of the power of the motor inside of this base with the shape of this blade which actually looks Time: 08:30 - 08:40 shockingly like a stickman doing a deadlift is enough to create a Vortex on the inside let's try it and find out okay wow that I did not expect you can Time: 08:40 - 08:50 see it's like a Whirlpool this is so much more pleasant than using a Shaker it's got like a gentle hum to it and nothing spills anywhere it's so clean Time: 08:50 - 09:00 okay let's try it one thing about that is that is incredibly smooth and that's apparently just the side effect of how this thing goes about mixing your drink man if that's a 40 satisfying Gadget Time: 09:00 - 09:10 what's a 400 one gonna be like well we're gonna find out soon enough because we're already at a hundred dollars with this maglev platform so apparently this Time: 09:10 - 09:20 uses an electromagnet that's strong enough to not just levitate the platform but also whatever I put on the platform I actually have a very strange idea what if we try and put a spinning fidget spinner on a spinning levitating Time: 09:20 - 09:30 platform okay so I'm going to spin the platform clockwise and then I'm gonna spin the fidget spinner counterclockwise I think this will work huh oh my gosh that's crazy did you see Time: 09:30 - 09:40 that the levitating piece of chicken yeah don't eat from there oh and actually on the topic of Time: 09:40 - 09:50 levitation this machine can this almost feels like science fiction apparently levitate water we all know how magnets work this is probably the gadget I have the Time: 09:50 - 10:00 least confidence in oh my God he actually looks like he's traveling upwards had me for a second this might Time: 10:00 - 10:10 not be coming across perfectly on camera but quite an impressive site so obviously water can't actually be flowing upwards Against Gravity but the way it looks Time: 10:10 - 10:20 like it works is individual drops of water are falling at a constant rate from here down to here there's a really precise cone at the bottom that's stopping that water splashing and then at the same time there is a strobing Time: 10:20 - 10:30 light that's basically flashing on and off really really quickly and that makes it kind of like a really sneaky illusion where you're looking at one drop as it's falling but then when the lights go off and then they come back on again you're Time: 10:30 - 10:40 actually looking at a different drop that's above that drop without realizing it so it looks like the drop has traveled upwards genuinely hypnotic 8.5 out of 10. okay so you remember those fruit Cutters from earlier right well Time: 10:40 - 10:50 this is basically the baller version of them and now that we've put it all together I can kind of see why so the way this works is you lift up the flap Time: 10:50 - 11:00 at the back and then you pull open the spring-loaded mechanism and that's when you drop the poor vegetable in such that when you let go of this spring-loaded mechanism it will push the vegetable towards the blades at the end this is actually so heartbreaking there's like a Time: 11:00 - 11:10 little piece of pepper sticking its way through knowing what's about to happen to it I don't want to be the one to do it oh my gosh each slice is so precise and Time: 11:10 - 11:20 thin I feel like I can see the cell walls in this it's also surprisingly smooth I just realized what we have to try kinetic sand this could be a match Time: 11:20 - 11:30 made in heaven I mean to listen out for the sound oh my gosh it's cutting off like a Time: 11:30 - 11:40 single layer of sand at a time you're either Gonna Love it or you're gonna hate it speaking of sand this might just be the most elaborate sand toy that I ever laid eyes on it's got a slightly Time: 11:40 - 11:50 cheap 3D printed in someone's garage kind of look to it which for 200 is not the dream anyways sand in turn the machine on and then the only thing left Time: 11:50 - 12:00 to do is to drop one of these ball bearings in there I'm assuming there's meant to be a magnet on the inside here right my bad there's another switch drop this in see what happens yes look it's like a shark Time: 12:00 - 12:10 under the sand it's kind of like what I imagine a pet rock would be like okay we'll come back at the end and see what it's done okay we've tested a lot of Time: 12:10 - 12:20 bleeding edge gadgets over the years we've seen shoes that allow you to physically feel music we've seen infinitely repeating dodecahedrons and working displays the thickness of a Time: 12:20 - 12:30 piece of paper but this airless paint sprayer right here is up there with one of the most exciting of all for me so let's just say you've moved into a new place you've left your garage door unlocked one night and you have some Time: 12:30 - 12:40 very friendly neighbors I realize how Niche this scenario is oh Jesus what am I doing I can basically fill this tank with clean white paint oh even Time: 12:40 - 12:50 that's so satisfying and then this base compartment can effectively suck out all the air and create a vacuum with that paint which means that when I spray from here it should come out as smooth and as Time: 12:50 - 13:00 quiet as can be this is a proper like industrial bit of kit Time: 13:00 - 13:10 pushing me well like it's almost gone back to just how the paper used to be and it's so smooth coming out this hose it's the same about that goggling box though it's such a smooth move even coat Time: 13:10 - 13:20 of paint 7 out of ten I cannot believe that an item like this actually exists and it actually got delivered to us this robot can write for you Time: 13:20 - 13:30 and I didn't realize I had to build it myself okay that only took us about five hours but it's fully assembled now Time: 13:30 - 13:40 so I'm just gonna hand it our weird crushed looking pen and then we pull up something called the inkscape software which lets us design any image we want to and then the robot can turn that Time: 13:40 - 13:50 image into a path that it needs to follow to make it I know the perfect test for this how perfect a circle can a robot draw go haha Time: 13:50 - 14:00 that was far better than I thought it was gonna do there's something very surreal about seeing that happen it's the fact that yes you can just print Time: 14:00 - 14:10 things in perfect circles but I have just seen this use a manual instrument and execute that in person I don't see how we can get more satisfying than that give it a nine just in case right this Time: 14:10 - 14:20 feels like a challenge I'm gonna pull up the same photo of my cat for both the robot and me to see also you can draw it better man vs machines do this is so intimidating not to worry I did Time: 14:20 - 14:30 art at school and I didn't fail does not look like a cat although I'm slightly concerned it's one of those drawings that's going to come together at the last minute and look incredible Time: 14:30 - 14:40 oh I just realized what it's doing the whole drawing is upside down and but that is actually incredible maybe I can beat it on speed the worst part of this is it's not just better than me it's Time: 14:40 - 14:50 also faster so that's what the axi draw robot did here's my cat I only have one thing left to say here it's a good day for Humanity no that's Time: 14:50 - 15:00 you yeah right there he's more interested in the DVD screensaver 800 800 is the price of this clock it's Time: 15:00 - 15:10 not made of any spectacularly fancy materials it doesn't tell the time any more accurately than a normal clock but it does have one key differentiator it tells the time with a levitating hand Time: 15:10 - 15:20 this ball right here so we mount it on the wall I'm really enjoying this led ring around it and we basically set it so that right now it's counting minutes so one whole round is 60 seconds there's Time: 15:20 - 15:30 an accessory for this so you line that up with that dot and apparently you just slide that in oh my God wait the magnet's moving okay I was too ambitious we need to do it Time: 15:30 - 15:40 horizontally oh my we got it let me just mount it this is wild I feel like I'm inside of a Harry Potter movie it's even like rotating on the spot okay so check this out we can set the timer to one minute Time: 15:40 - 15:50 each second it moves along you can even see the LED follow it around and the cool thing about this is that you can set one round of this clock to mean anything you want it to mean so it could Time: 15:50 - 16:00 count a week it could count a month it could count just towards a specific point in time in the future that you're looking forward to which is a feature I love a hundred dollars though I know time is money but this is something else Time: 16:00 - 16:10 getting to the very highest end gadgets now this is the Miku formulas and it's been talked about on the internet as the Pinnacle the literal climax for satisfaction Seekers the idea being that Time: 16:10 - 16:20 let's say you've just designed a product of your own then you can place that product inside of it and use this to create a mold of it to efficiently recreate it as many times as you want I Time: 16:20 - 16:30 mean the outcome is cool and all but it's more the way that it goes about it that's the fun bit so our Mouse right here is effectively sitting on a vacuum that's going to suck out all the air it's actually just a Henry the Hoover Time: 16:30 - 16:40 but you may do and then on top of that is a plastic sheet that is now being heated from a filament above and as soon as that gets to the right temperature we're going to bring that Plastics down wow oh my God it's created a complete Time: 16:40 - 16:50 seal around that product that's the day when we get to actually print the mice as well how do we get the mouse out I do actually need my mouse back this is how Time: 16:50 - 17:00 I'm gonna use it from now on well the good news is that I can still move my mouse the slightly less good news is that I can no longer press buttons or scroll Wheels but this is a video that Time: 17:00 - 17:10 just keeps giving if you asked a random person on the street to design their ideal piece of technology I imagine that a printer that can 3D print chocolate would be pretty high on the list so it Time: 17:10 - 17:20 comes with these really strange chocolate cigar looking things in the box which you basically shove up the nozzle at the bottom and then we just browse the various different folders of Time: 17:20 - 17:30 things we could potentially print and you can do chess pieces I love chess let's print a rook so it's moving both the nozzle and the tray underneath it to Time: 17:30 - 17:40 create the shape look how precise the square is this is my kind of machine and it's almost completely silent and here is our Rook wow so it looks like it's had some trouble with the base of it but Time: 17:40 - 17:50 the rest of it is spot on it's so precisely crafted but this actually goes further because you can also add in your own SD card loaded with any 3D model you Time: 17:50 - 18:00 can find on the internet and apparently I can print that too so of course we're going to try a Pokemon okay see if they can make a Bulbasaur oh it's the inside of Bulbasaur don't think I'd ever see Time: 18:00 - 18:10 that and you can tell this time right the machine's even got the base right I cannot wait to see this one eternity later yeah so basically we ran out of chocolate part way through printing that Time: 18:10 - 18:20 so we have a headless Bulbasaur over here oh yeah a very very nice headless Bulbasaur but then the cool part of this is that we've managed to print one Bulbasaur in many many different sizes Time: 18:20 - 18:30 it's like a very weird semi-headless family I'll eat the biggest one the texture is so fun you can feel every single layer is built on the inside yeah Time: 18:30 - 18:40 it's something special there you go bulb is all for you cooking with moments of immense satisfaction I had another one the other day you might know that when I went to Time: 18:40 - 18:50 go see Mr Beast earlier this year he got me addicted to anime he showed me a series called Death Note on Netflix which I finished beginning to end in a month and I'm currently looking for the next one to binge open to Time: 18:50 - 19:00 recommendations by the way also isn't it kind of insane how this is actually automatically spread out all the satin the problem is you can't find half of these shows on the UK version of Netflix so imagine the feeling when I realized Time: 19:00 - 19:10 that I could use the surfshark VPN subscription that I already had and already used to encrypt my internet traffic and monitor my email address in real time for any data leaks to just Time: 19:10 - 19:20 swap my location to the United States to access the US version of Netflix which did have those shows on it but the crazy part of it is that this whole surf shark package together is just 249 a month which split between the seven people I Time: 19:20 - 19:30 share it with is 36 Cents so hit the link in the description and use the code boss and you'll get it not just for that 249 a month price but also three extra months for free on top of that fully Time: 19:30 - 19:40 refundable Time: 19:40 - 19:50Probably the only guy who can unexpectedly rick roll us even when we know that there's a rick roll somewhere",

      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:10 seen so number seven is the galaxy s4 zoom i got a bit lucky with this one i logged on to ebay and it was sitting in front of me but this is a special phone because Time: 00:10 - 00:20 while it might seem like just a standard 2013 device from the front turn it over and you realize we've got a bit of an imposter on our hands Time: 00:20 - 00:30 but do you wanna know the crazy part all of this stuff is just there so that this phone can have 10 times optical zoom the modern day galaxy s21 ultra also has 10 times optical zoom it's just Time: 00:30 - 00:40 this one doesn't look like it's been let loose in an all-you-can-eat buffet samsung wasn't wrong about zoom being a key selling point in the future it's just that soon after this phone Time: 00:40 - 00:50 came out companies figured out a more efficient way of doing it see the traditional method and how it was done on the s4 zoom as well as just generally point and shoot cameras is to have a whole load of Time: 00:50 - 01:00 stacked bits of glass that by changing the distance between them can magnify things without losing quality but then came the eureka moment of multiple cameras what if instead of Time: 01:00 - 01:10 just one camera that you have to put all of this movable glass in front of so it can reach all of these different magnifications we just have two fixed cameras one that Time: 01:10 - 01:20 can capture a wide view and one that can capture that zoomed view this worked so well that in 2021 every single smartphone uses this technology and if we test these two phones side by Time: 01:20 - 01:30 side i mean obviously we are comparing 2013 to 2021 here but it's just cool that we're now at a stage where in most aspects this clever engineering paired with a bit of Time: 01:30 - 01:40 software magic can outperform last gen's pure optics number six is the no phone number six is the no phone Time: 01:40 - 01:50 and it kind of looks like the pinnacle of stupidity but it worked and thanks to huel for sponsoring this video Time: 01:50 - 02:00 ouch so this is the packaging and it's probably its best feature no literally you can do more things with the bag it came in than the thing itself and is it just me or does this no phone Time: 02:00 - 02:10 look suspiciously like another not so innovative device but what this company did is played on the growing sentiment that tech is ruining our lives Time: 02:10 - 02:20 they said to people do you feel the constant urge to have your phone with you to which most people probably said yes do you wish you could be less attached to it to which most people probably also said Time: 02:20 - 02:30 yes the solution is simple hold our thing instead people bought their vision this idea that the no phone was effectively the Time: 02:30 - 02:40 anti smartphone how its branded is taking zero megapixel photos and having zero gigabytes of storage and how it's toilet bowl resistant because it's a sheet Time: 02:40 - 02:50 of plastic it was fully funded on kickstarter the creators were invited to all manner of interviews and even a ted talk and they're still selling them today six years later although when i tried to Time: 02:50 - 03:00 get one there was a serious stock shortage and it took them like an extra month to get it to me but that's even crazier they're selling bundles the couple's cure the family plan even the employee gift pack and they Time: 03:00 - 03:10 released a follow-up device i really wish i was joking but this is an actual product and i'm just out here trying to think Time: 03:10 - 03:20 what would the returns process look like on this hey uh my no phone air doesn't seem to be working ah let me have a look [Music] Time: 03:20 - 03:30 seems good to me um okay i don't really like this phone can i can i just get my money back why of Time: 03:30 - 03:40 course just please return the device first i just it's right here with all due respect sir Time: 03:40 - 03:50 that is your hand [Music] number four imagine this headline ex-apple ceo starts his own phone company and not Time: 03:50 - 04:00 just any apple ceo this was john scully the guy who who kind of replaced steve jobs back in the day and his idea was interesting that most 200 budget devices at the time were Time: 04:00 - 04:10 purely functional they had little to no attention given to hardware design or even software design so scully created the company ob Time: 04:10 - 04:20 with the goal of producing phones that had that apple brag factor that designed in silicon valley coolness but for emerging markets like india and africa and just given the fact that Time: 04:20 - 04:30 apple has got such a reputation for only doing things when they know they're going to be huge the sky was the limit here and i'd even go as far as to say that the presentation was promising it was a Time: 04:30 - 04:40 great demonstration of how the company could make something both premium and practically priced it's just for a fashion focus device it Time: 04:40 - 04:50 sure does look an awful lot like a toilet seat the bottom is rounded the top is flat it generally looks like the company built a rounded phone first and then realized wait a second this just looks like every Time: 04:50 - 05:00 other phone make it different and i think this kind of mentality is also what led them to a screen that is raised above the rest of the phone i think the idea was to prevent your fingers resting on the display Time: 05:00 - 05:10 itself but yes this is as impractical as it looks more fundamentally though if you're entering a new market with a new product and a new brand then the one thing that you've got to Time: 05:10 - 05:20 absolutely make sure you're doing is solving a problem that people are having because yes you could argue they have built a cooler phone for people who like toilets but for the Time: 05:20 - 05:30 majority of the markets they were targeting being visually unique was far from the primary concern so it flopped they went back to the drawing board relaunched and it flopped Time: 05:30 - 05:40 again and it wasn't long before john scully just straight up started denying his involvement with the company pretty fun story but now is where things start to get really curious this is the k1 impulse marketed as the Time: 05:40 - 05:50 most secure device on the planet and i got to start by saying this is easily top 5 smartphone unboxing experiences that i've probably ever had Time: 05:50 - 06:00 so if we take off the wrapper and the sleeve we're left with two magnetic doors and inside them is everything you could possibly expect but also everything that you probably Time: 06:00 - 06:10 didn't we've got the phone which says privacy is the new order feels like i'm joining a cult we've got a beefy insert with a whole menu of paperwork as well as a very unusually shaped case Time: 06:10 - 06:20 and of course you can take this layer off and as well as just a charger and a usbc cable you get a full three-course meal of travel adapters but Time: 06:20 - 06:30 then we go back to the top layer again and you find a carbon fiber wireless charging pad a pair of really quite high-end wireless earphones with a display on top that shows battery Time: 06:30 - 06:40 percentage and then take off this middle part and you've got three private keys which will make sense in a minute and then uh what what is this if anyone has any idea just Time: 06:40 - 06:50 let me know and if you thought it couldn't get any stranger well i mean just look at it Time: 06:50 - 07:00 long story short this may come as a surprise after that ridiculously embellished unboxing experience but this phone was a scam the company had built their own supposedly ultra Time: 07:00 - 07:10 secure crypto data os these keys you're actually meant to plug them into the phone so you can enter your own secure vault and it's the weirdest thing they tried to legitimize their own Time: 07:10 - 07:20 security by inviting people to hack them first thing you see on this website is hackers for a million dollars could you ever imagine like any legitimate company doing this Time: 07:20 - 07:30 and their number one selling point was that this was the first and only phone to run voice over blockchain protocol or Time: 07:30 - 07:40 vob i mean if we're all inventing words here then a sub to the channel would be pleb you've probably heard a fair bit about the blockchain it's the basis of bitcoin but at its Time: 07:40 - 07:50 core it's just a decentralized way of storing data so that it doesn't belong to any one single person or company but the issue with blockchain is that it's just not very well understood by Time: 07:50 - 08:00 most so this company basically tried to use that ambiguity to make it seem like it had almost magical properties they said to people things like you get unlimited storage for free Time: 08:00 - 08:10 because blockchain anyways just before this phone came out the guys behind it were suspected of a scam involving cryptocurrency Time: 08:10 - 08:20 and it was bad timing because all of a sudden people were like wait a second is anything they said actually true and sure enough under scrutiny it turns out that the private Time: 08:20 - 08:30 keys were just flash drives almost every article covering the launch was a paid article by the company and in the name of supposed security most basic smartphone features like Time: 08:30 - 08:40 gmail social media and even importing contacts did not work and for everyone who messaged their helpline to try and get some support on this they either got completely blanked or Time: 08:40 - 08:50 they got given a 200 word essay on how these were the necessary precautions needed for vobop to work also i'm getting the sinking feeling that what they've actually done here Time: 08:50 - 09:00 is just bought a cheap phone from china and then stuck this fancy casing around it and made it their own because otherwise why does this look suspiciously like a 3d printed cutout Time: 09:00 - 09:10 and why else would it have not one but two sets of bezels it's very suspicious and customers soon started to worry that by buying this phone and by having used Time: 09:10 - 09:20 it to manage their own cryptocurrency wallets they'd inadvertently given the company behind this phone full access to their crypto accounts and so they were worried that this company could effectively steal their Time: 09:20 - 09:30 money which they were suspected of in this other scam and then remotely brick their device with a software update pretty scary stuff okay number two is Time: 09:30 - 09:40 rare so rare that i couldn't find a single unopened one of these on the entire internet and the only one that i could find literally came delivered to me in a lunchbox the Time: 09:40 - 09:50 ultimate and reusable packaging i guess it's just it's just a shame that there are no sandwiches included welcome to the turing phone and i've got to say Time: 09:50 - 10:00 apart from the fact that this kind of feels like holding a pair of scissors on the wrong end i think it looks gorgeous it's an almost modular aesthetic with each panel having a slightly different Time: 10:00 - 10:10 soft touch matte finish with one of them just straight up dragon scale texture it's weird that it works but i think it does work and the whole thing is apparently built from liquid morphium Time: 10:10 - 10:20 which is stronger than steel but what is it well picture this it's 2015 we've had the galaxy s6 the iphone 6s but touring robotic industries just Time: 10:20 - 10:30 comes out of nowhere and says hold up we've got a phone that not just outspects them but is encrypted to keep your privacy i wonder where we've heard that one before Time: 10:30 - 10:40 these phones did get made or at least like a few of them did but most sources say that not a single one got delivered to customers somewhere along the line i think it really hit this company just how hard it Time: 10:40 - 10:50 is to make a fully working smartphone and how they really needed more than the 50 employees they had to do it you know of all markets i'd be Time: 10:50 - 11:00 willing to bet that the smartphone market is probably one of the hardest for new companies to enter it feels like everyone wants a stab at it but at the same time eighty percent of the market is controlled by literally six companies Time: 11:00 - 11:10 anyways where this gets interesting is that after the turing phone didn't work out during robotic industries kind of started to fall into a bit of a downward spiral Time: 11:10 - 11:20 they'd lost some of their reputation so what do they do they try to tease an even more extreme phone to stay on people's minds the turing phone cadenza with get this Time: 11:20 - 11:30 an imax 6k quad camera a super capacitor battery paired with a hydrogen fuel cell and dual snapdragon 830 chips which Time: 11:30 - 11:40 are products that never actually existed and so when that too inevitably ended up with nothing they went even crazier they changed their name to touring space Time: 11:40 - 11:50 industries and teased something called the hubble phone with you know it's not even worth going through the spec sheet it didn't happen and so the supposed encryption and the liquid morpheme that Time: 11:50 - 12:00 we're getting here well i'm having my doubts but no one's tested it because no one got the phone if you look at this company's bio Time: 12:00 - 12:10 they describe themselves as a mobile technology company which develops technologies based on decentralized authentication methodology using static key exchange with an anonymous key distribution infrastructure Time: 12:10 - 12:20 point is the one thing to take away from this video is that if a company can't tell you what they're doing for you in simple terms then there's a pretty good chance that they're trying to hide something also fun fact i found a reddit thread from Time: 12:20 - 12:30 someone who applied to work for these guys and as part of his interview he was tasked with doing what seems an awful lot like their job for them they basically gave Time: 12:30 - 12:40 him like a two week long assignment which involved building an app from scratch with a really specific set of functions clever but very sneaky okay Time: 12:40 - 12:50 finally the thinnest smartphone in the world i knew i wanted to see one of these in person i just i had no idea how to get one i literally i set up ebay alerts in case Time: 12:50 - 13:00 anyone listed one i've trawled through sites like aliexpress and gearbest probably once every two weeks in case any seller found they still had inventory nothing and so just before i was about Time: 13:00 - 13:10 to pretty much ditch the entire video idea i thought let me just message vivo just in case no expectations and so i did and they even warned me like this is probably not Time: 13:10 - 13:20 gonna happen the phone is long discontinued but one month later i was just doing something completely different and i got an out the blue email saying we found it and here we are so this is the vivo x5 Time: 13:20 - 13:30 max it's a pretty understated package for a phone with this prestigious a title you get the device on top and then earphones charger Time: 13:30 - 13:40 and manuals let's do this [Music] clearly the outer plastic wasn't built to wait seven years Time: 13:40 - 13:50 okay let me give you some perspective the rog phone five is 10.3 millimeters thick the oneplus 9 is 8.7 millimeters thick Time: 13:50 - 14:00 the iphone 12 mini this tiny thing is 7.4 millimeters thick this is 4.75 the phone feels almost two-dimensional compared to what Time: 14:00 - 14:10 i'm used to i'm pretty sure i've had rulers that are thicker than this but do you wanna know the funny part they've still managed to get a headphone jack on there you can actually see that Time: 14:10 - 14:20 the metal trim of the phone is so narrow that they've had to cut into the back plate just so it fits which goes to show that if a company wants to put a headphone jack on a phone they can put a headphone Time: 14:20 - 14:30 jack on the phone and the crazy part of this is that this is 2015. could you imagine if we wanted to build the thinnest phone in the world now in 2021 with all our performance and Time: 14:30 - 14:40 efficiency improvements we could probably make a better phone that's 3.75 millimeters but it's just that priorities have changed in 2021 people want advanced camera systems and 5g and big Time: 14:40 - 14:50 batteries and all of these things lead to bulkier phones plus i just i feel like being this thin is a little counterintuitive because it's so thin that it's more Time: 14:50 - 15:00 likely to break but if you then put a case on it it's not thin it's still a beautiful bit of tech to look at and still an engineering marvel but i reckon if a Time: 15:00 - 15:10 company released a really thin phone today then tons of people would flock to go and see it but very few of them would actually follow through and buy it okay this is huell Time: 15:10 - 15:20 i've actually been drinking this stuff for like four years before the company actually reached out and wanted to sponsor something but here we are so when you buy huel you're basically buying a whole meal Time: 15:20 - 15:30 in powder form you get a free shaker with it and to make it you literally just add water and shake and it's actually built so that you don't even need to pour it into anything Time: 15:30 - 15:40 you drink it from the shaker it's healthy like almost the entire ingredients list is just oats peas coconuts grains it's got tons of protein 26 essential vitamins and minerals Time: 15:40 - 15:50 and it tastes surprisingly good and the one i've switched to recently is the new black edition which is the exact same concept but with 33 more protein and 50 less carbs Time: 15:50 - 16:00 so give it a try i have left a link down below and if you order through there you get not just the fuel and the shaker but also a heel t-shirt they are very Time: 16:00 - 16:10 nice t-shirts anyways thank you so much for watching my name is aaron this is mr who's the boss and i'll catch you in the next one Time: 16:10 - 16:20 you Time: 16:30 - 16:40I'm interested to see whats inside the no phone air",

      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:10 all right kicking things off with OnePlus who spent a good few months this year hyping up the OnePlus watch they showed us that it looked just like any other high-end Samsung or Google Smartwatch they showed us that it had a Time: 00:10 - 00:20 beautiful OLED screen and that it only cost $159 it's all looking great until we realize that it's not actually a smartwatch it doesn't run apps it can't Time: 00:20 - 00:30 play your Spotify playlist it's basically just taken the insides of a fitness tracker like xiaomi's $40 meand 6 and one plused it into a smartwatch form factor two out of 10 fail some Time: 00:30 - 00:40 people liked it most didn't you didn't like it either did you you might remember this pair of sunglasses these are the Snapchat spectacles designed to Time: 00:40 - 00:50 be put on your face pressed over here after which they'll instantly start recording video on the camera on this side for your Snapchat story and the cool thing about these is that they Time: 00:50 - 01:00 shoot circular video which means anyone who watches your story can watch it in portrait they can watch it in landscape or any orientation in between and they're still getting a full siiz picture but Snapchat really goofed this Time: 01:00 - 01:10 one up for some bizarre reason instead of selling these online and capitalizing on the global reach that their platform had built spectacles would only be available through select Snapchat Time: 01:10 - 01:20 branded vending machines it took 5 months before everyone could actually go online and buy them but at that point there's no hype people just didn't care anymore this feels like a 3 out of 10 fail they have come out with three more Time: 01:20 - 01:30 iterations since then so it's not like the spectacles brand is dead but by scuffing up the first launch they have sent it on the wrong trajectory okay I Time: 01:30 - 01:40 smell just realized that needs context I smell is the name of a product released all the way back in 1999 and it was meant to usher in the next era of Time: 01:40 - 01:50 computing it plugged into your PC with a USB port and it stored 128 different chemicals inside it which it could release in any combination to create pretty much any scent it want wanted to Time: 01:50 - 02:00 from fresh cut grass to burning rubber to I kid you not rotting swamp and do you know what it worked this company had a huge Vision they were getting ready to Time: 02:00 - 02:10 partner up with iMac Cinemas video game developers they even created a web portal where users could send each other their own custom sents AKA a snortle the Time: 02:10 - 02:20 issue was more that it just wasn't a very good idea ice smell was developed on the premise that well we can see things on our computers we can hear things from our computers smell is the Time: 02:20 - 02:30 next logical sense to add in there whereas in actuality consumers had no use for it apart from apparently using it to create custom farts smells three out of Time: 02:30 - 02:40 10 but the '90s were actually full of tech flops like this companies just flailing around in the hope that they just happen to land on the next big thing for example Microsoft they found Time: 02:40 - 02:50 themselves wanting to keep adding more features to their Windows operating system but were worried that by doing so they were going to create yet more confusion for people who weren't digital natives so the solution was a complete Time: 02:50 - 03:00 overhaul called buul this replaced your typical desktop your start key and Columns of icons with a house the idea was that it could introduce people to Windows programs like letter writer in a Time: 03:00 - 03:10 way that they were used to in their real lives by for example putting the program on a desk and you could go to different rooms to access different programs but the truth of it is though Microsoft Time: 03:10 - 03:20 underestimated people the normal Windows desktop was not really that hard to understand and the simplified version was well not only condescending to Time: 03:20 - 03:30 anyone over the age of eight but it also added extra steps that meant even when you got good everything you're doing was just slower 3 out of 10 fail saved slightly by the fact that Bob is the Time: 03:30 - 03:40 origin of that virtual assistant clippy who stuck with us okay if you spend a reasonable amount of time on the internet you'll probably have heard of the 2021 Zack Snider's Justice League Time: 03:40 - 03:50 it's a film set in the DC Universe so involving Batman Superman Etc but the really interesting thing about this film is that it's already been released once before but back in 2017 we had the Time: 03:50 - 04:00 Justice League movie but what had happened is the director Zack Snider his daughter died partway through filming which is horrific and obviously he couldn't just carry on making the film Time: 04:00 - 04:10 as if nothing had happened he needed time problem was though that instead of giving him time the company instead got a replacement director in a director who had his own vision and in the end fans Time: 04:10 - 04:20 didn't love it reviews were mixed to disappointed in a best case scenario and the film actually lost almost $60 million as a result here's the thing this DC Universe is in direct Time: 04:20 - 04:30 competition with the Marvel Universe which has its own set of superheroes and stories assemble and given that Marvel has literally been pumping out a box office hit every year DC needed Justice Time: 04:30 - 04:40 League to be better than this people were so upset that they started rallying to see Snider's version of the film they started creating social media campaigns even hiring a plane to fly a banner over Time: 04:40 - 04:50 DC events in protest I'll give this a four out of 10 fail made slightly better by the fact that fans did get what they wanted in the end eventually Snider did return he got together the original Time: 04:50 - 05:00 actors and he finished his version of the film the way he'd envisioned it it was better but because it was re-release it just didn't get the numbers that you kind of want for this caliber of film Time: 05:00 - 05:10 and if you are enjoying this video then a sub to the channel would be super man all right you've seen a dual camera Time: 05:10 - 05:20 you've seen a triple camera you've probably seen a quad camera but this is what happens when the company light decides to make a $2,000 hexa DEA camera the idea was to try and recreate DSLR Time: 05:20 - 05:30 quality in a pocketable smartphone form vector and to do that they've swapped out one enormous protruding lens for 16 smaller cameras spread out over a larger area and every time I tap this shutter Time: 05:30 - 05:40 button right here at least 10 of those cameras which are all seeing slightly different things capture and then use computational photography to fuse their images together for one enormous Time: 05:40 - 05:50 complete shot I remember being so excited for this product I also remember not being able to afford this product but that's besides the point this light l16 could turn out an 81 megapixel Time: 05:50 - 06:00 output that was almost unheard of in 2017 unfortunately this company had bitten off more than they could chew their idea had potential it's not Time: 06:00 - 06:10 impossible to do what they were trying to do but creating software that can properly interpret and fuse the data from 16 cameras is such a complex task that even Mammoth companies like Google aren't able to do it yet how is this Time: 06:10 - 06:20 little startup going to do it and plus the fact that the l16 was churning out its own kind of specialized images meant that you couldn't just send them straight from this to Instagram you'd Time: 06:20 - 06:30 have to connect to a computer run them through the company's own editing app and then export in a usable format this complexity meant that it wasn't really tempting for people who already took photos on their phone and the mediocre Time: 06:30 - 06:40 execution meant that it wasn't really tempting for people who already had DSLR cameras so even though it raised over $180 million in funding the LEL 16 went Time: 06:40 - 06:50 dark you've probably heard of the legendary war between Intel and AMD for the past 20 years to be honest longer the these two companies have been each Time: 06:50 - 07:00 other's biggest and only rivals in the fight for the best desktop CPU and for the majority of it Intel's been winning see the thing is for the same price you could get an AMD chip with more Calles Time: 07:00 - 07:10 but Intel's architecture was more efficient and so each core they did have was more powerful and because historically apps and games were programmed to take advantage of two Time: 07:10 - 07:20 maybe four cores but probably not more than that you usually better off with Intel so with that in mind in 2011 AMD made what can only be described as a severe lapse in judgment what they Time: 07:20 - 07:30 needed to do was to come out and say okay our next Generation chips are coming they have fewer or maybe the same amount of cores but each core that we do have is going to be good what they Time: 07:30 - 07:40 actually did though was came out with their bulldozer architecture even more cores with even weaker performance per core these Calles had been so hampered that AMD had a $1.1 million lawsuit on Time: 07:40 - 07:50 their hands from consumers who felt like actually these don't even really count a separate cores it almost looked like AMD was Time: 07:50 - 08:00 am done but I'm only giving this a 4 out of 10 fail because of how this company has miraculously bounced back in the last few years the combination of a Intel getting a little too comfortable Time: 08:00 - 08:10 at the top B amd's architecture coming a long way and C applications becoming more able to use the extra cores the AMD gives you has meant that for the first time in 15 years they've rocketed up and Time: 08:10 - 08:20 finally knocked Intel off the top spot in terms of market share am damn okay this one hurts for me I was a Time: 08:20 - 08:30 huge fan of the PlayStation Portable when I was a teenager the fact that you could play it anywhere meant that I've never sunk more hours into a single console I was so into it that I distinctly remember times when I would Time: 08:30 - 08:40 just sit there and dream about what a next gen PSP would look like Sony answered my prayers out came the PlayStation Vita in 2011 and it was more Time: 08:40 - 08:50 than I even dreamed of dual analog sticks beautiful OLED screen almost PlayStation 3 level Graphics I swear I almost had a nerd fit when I saw this thing get launched but it sold terribly Time: 08:50 - 09:00 in large part I think because of pricing it's only paired a $250 starting figure with the fact that to actually use this console people also needed to buy a special Sony branded SD card at $120 for Time: 09:00 - 09:10 just 32 GB here's the thing right the initial sales of a console are absolutely crucial if your machine does not sell well to start with then less Time: 09:10 - 09:20 developers are going to want to make good games for it and then even less customers are going to want to actually buy the thing thankfully Sony has learned from this that's why with this gener with the PS5 they actually decided Time: 09:20 - 09:30 to make a loss on that console just to make it affordable to get that initial sales push but for the Vita it was pretty much Dead on Arrival finished off by the fact that then Sony decided to Time: 09:30 - 09:40 just stop talking about it they decided that the reason it had sold poly was because of the rise of smartphone gaming when actually the fact that Nintendo switch is still flying off the shelves Time: 09:40 - 09:50 in 2021 proves that that's not true they just screwed it up 4 out of 10 okay let's be honest for a second there was a point in all of our lives when we wanted Time: 09:50 - 10:00 a 3D TV I mean it makes total sense 3D is the next logical step after 2D it's just every now and again in the tech industry we get ideas being implemented before the tech is good enough we have Time: 10:00 - 10:10 these visions of what the future is and companies rush to get their first and in the case of 3D this Rush meant that the standard that was actually established was just far too convoluted and Time: 10:10 - 10:20 expensive you needed to pay extra to get a panel capable of 3D you had to get a specific type of Blu-ray player that could handle 3D content and every single person watching would need to have their Time: 10:20 - 10:30 own set of specialized and not very comfortable 3D glasses imagine this say I wanted to invite a family over to watch a movie with mine not only are we all going to sit there looking like a Time: 10:30 - 10:40 bunch of tools but that could be 10 glasses sometimes costing $150 each and it's not even like they could just bring their own that they already have because different brands of 3D TVs would use Time: 10:40 - 10:50 different 3D Technologies just kill me now so even though 3D TVs managed to sell in decent numbers to start with out Time: 10:50 - 11:00 of pure hype the people who own these TVs didn't find themselves using 3D and so pretty much wrote off the feature as something they didn't care about in their next TV so within about 7 years of their mainstream appearance everyone was Time: 11:00 - 11:10 either in the camp of I've tried 3D and I don't care for it or I was never into 3D in the first place worthy I think of a five out of 10 fail pretty funny Time: 11:10 - 11:20 seeing the entire industry Galloping towards 3D like this is the future let's make some money and then silently trying to slip away when they realized that it was all right imagine this it's 2010 the Time: 11:20 - 11:30 Nintendo Wii has come onto the scene and completely changed our perception of what it means to be a gamer so unsurprisingly Microsoft wanted a piece Time: 11:30 - 11:40 of that cake and do you know what to some extent they killed it they worked with a 3D sensing company to develop a camera for your Xbox 360 that was just like the Wii but able to use all of your Time: 11:40 - 11:50 limbs without any controller at all this wasn't some half-baked Wii knockoff this was a step above and you could tell that people were excited about it by the fact that connect actually broke a Guinness Time: 11:50 - 12:00 world record for the fastest selling electronic device on record holy moly but then it very quickly and very curiously lost Time: 12:00 - 12:10 momentum it all came down to timing see the initial tsunami of sales that came from people who thought oh the Wii was a complete Game Changer and this is basically the Wii 2.0 so I got to get on Time: 12:10 - 12:20 that before it sells out but after this Mass hysteria you were left with two camps of people those who just wanted that casual gaming experience to just be Time: 12:20 - 12:30 able to play Virtual Tennis against their friends and this group was perfectly happy with the Wii they already had even if connect was technically superior but then also the hardcore Gamers had no real reason to Time: 12:30 - 12:40 buy a connect because all of these big budget developers the ones that tend to make hardcore games they'd spent decades optimizing for traditional controllers Time: 12:40 - 12:50 and they just felt no urge to suddenly create something completely new so as an alternative to original content Xbox started integrating connect features into normal existing games but in a Time: 12:50 - 13:00 really cringe and unnecessary manner like for example if you swore while playing FIFA the ref ingame could hear you through the microphone in your connect and give you a red card who's Time: 13:00 - 13:10 the idea was that for the launch of their next Generation Xbox the Xbox one they decided to announce that connect was a Time: 13:10 - 13:20 mandatory part of the package you had to buy connect to get the new Xbox which as you can imagine went down about as well as a lead balloon it's pretty rare to Time: 13:20 - 13:30 see a product that starts with record-breaking sales but then flops twice in one decade what can I say connect just didn't connect 5 out of 10 fail but let's talk about that Xbox one Time: 13:30 - 13:40 because connect was not the company's biggest blunder you see back in 2013 Xbox was in a good position their previous Xbox 360 was an unarguable hit Time: 13:40 - 13:50 it was fairly priced unlike the PS3 at launch and it was jam-packed with top tier exclusive games Xbox had people on their side and so all they really needed to do was to release an next gen console Time: 13:50 - 14:00 and carry on doing what they were doing what did they actually do well one they called their successor the Xbox one which you know would be fine if it was Time: 14:00 - 14:10 the first Xbox but as it was actually the third caused an unnecessary amount of confusion especially next to Sony's seamless PS3 to PS4 transition two Xbox Time: 14:10 - 14:20 realized that people were increasingly using their consoles as a way to stream video content but then mistakenly used that info to decide that they were going to spend half of their nextg console Time: 14:20 - 14:30 reveal event you know the one event where people are tuning in around the world expecting to be blown away by the NextGen gaming experiences they're about to get talking about how it plays TV Time: 14:30 - 14:40 three the fact that they did choose to decide to bundle in Connect by default pushed the consoles price to $100 more than the PS4 it was up against but do you want know the worst part of all is Time: 14:40 - 14:50 how they started pushing this always online agenda they basically implied that you would have to connect your Xbox to the internet once per day if you wanted to keep playing your games just Time: 14:50 - 15:00 so that Xbox could make sure that you hadn't pirated them they said that you couldn't trade or sell games to other people because they would be locked to your online account but on top of all of this that you'd have to pay a $60 per Time: 15:00 - 15:10 year subscription for online connectivity even if all you wanted to do was to just check your Facebook account and they even went as far as to say that if you want a console that's Time: 15:10 - 15:20 not always online just buy our last Xbox I remember watching all this unfold at the time and I wanted to laugh and cry at the same time they basically gave so a perfect opportunity to rip them a new Time: 15:20 - 15:30 one which they did and Microsoft is still feeling the impact of that today bringing this to a prestigious 6 out of 10 fail okay when you think of drones Time: 15:30 - 15:40 you probably think of DJI right well back in 2014 GoPro wanted to change that they noticed that sales of their Flagship hero cameras were dipping and at the same time that drone sales were Time: 15:40 - 15:50 rocketing so why not create a drone that can use a GoPro Hero camera to record its footage that's literally two birds one Time: 15:50 - 16:00 drone the main issue though was that unlike most drones which place the camera directly underneath to establish a solid center of gravity GoPro put its camera in front of the Drone which Time: 16:00 - 16:10 caused more strain on the motors more vibration than was normal and this combined with a not so secure battery latch meant that for quite a few unfortunate customers their drones would Time: 16:10 - 16:20 lose power mid-flight you had some karmas falling out of the sky and at the same time a whole batch of other ones that couldn't take off because of a GPS bug the truth of it is It's just tough Time: 16:20 - 16:30 to enter a new product category and get it right first time not leas something as complex and error prone as a drone and what it boils down to is that GoPro rushed it the company had to issue a Time: 16:30 - 16:40 recall for every single Karma out there and it looks like they permanently exited the Drone space because of this blunder Karma does bite Time: 16:40 - 16:50 back transition okay we're in the top 10 things are about to get pretty fail tastic so you know we talk about cloud gaming nowadays streaming games just Time: 16:50 - 17:00 like we stream movies well imagine someone telling you in 2009 when we were still playing Halo 3 on our Xbox 360s that they figured out how to stream any game at Maximum PC quality graphical Time: 17:00 - 17:10 settings to any device without any console at all and this wasn't just any random person this was Steve Pearlman who used to be the brains at Apple and Time: 17:10 - 17:20 his concept actually worked he hired a team he founded the company on live and started getting the word out there they made an appearance at the game developers conference in 2009 and the Time: 17:20 - 17:30 reaction was straight up amazement this team started the day proudly forwarding articles to each other that the Press had written but as the day went on they Time: 17:30 - 17:40 realized that they could not keep up attendees were so impressed that they tried to pry open the walls of the on live Booth to check that they were in fact streaming the games and not playing them on a console behind the wall as a Time: 17:40 - 17:50 matter of fact for the duration of this conference more people searched for the term on live than they did video games so understand at this point these guys Time: 17:50 - 18:00 were rubbing their hands together absolutely expecting to be an instant hit the moment they launched they started deploying thousands of servers to be ready for the incoming wave of users but they never arrived turns out Time: 18:00 - 18:10 there was an enormous Gap in the number of people wanting to experience on live those willing to try a free demo versus the number of users who wanted to adopt it to pay a monthly subscription and Time: 18:10 - 18:20 switch from their already purchased console to game streaming internet infrastructure for one just wasn't as good then as it is now and Gamers were still very much of the opinion that they Time: 18:20 - 18:30 wanted to own their games not rent them from a server OnLive did officially quote that they had an active user base of 1.5 million but it turns out this figure actually includes every single Time: 18:30 - 18:40 person who had ever even tested the service and the actual concurrent active user base never passed 1,600 let me ask you a question what Time: 18:40 - 18:50 browser are you using right now it's probably going to be either the YouTube app or Google Chrome or maybe Safari but if this was 2002 I wouldn't have had to first because Internet Explorer held Time: 18:50 - 19:00 over 95% of the market share for web browsers this program was bundled in with every single Windows computer it was Unstoppable until Google Chrome came out in 2008 now you might be starting to Time: 19:00 - 19:10 notice a bit of a trend with this video there will always be a next thing especially in the world of tech it is not enough to just be the best you have Time: 19:10 - 19:20 to keep evolving to stay the best that's not what Internet Explorer did see this browser released back in 1995 was built to view web pag Pages because back then Time: 19:20 - 19:30 that's all the internet was ever used for and even with all its updates and patches it never really escaped that Chrome was built with a bigger Vision it wasn't just faster and more streamlined but it was open source meaning that any Time: 19:30 - 19:40 developer around the world could contribute and improve it it was built around support for proper web-based applications like Google Maps and this was only reinforced when they then Time: 19:40 - 19:50 dropped a full-on web app store plus all of this came at a time when Microsoft was fighting an antitrust case for basically abusing the power that they had with Windows to artificially get Time: 19:50 - 20:00 more people to use Internet Explorer which they bundled with it and after losing this battle they were forced to then give every new user the option of which browser they wanted to use at which point no one picked Internet Time: 20:00 - 20:10 Explorer right when I say The Avengers you think of the movies right these super high budget Blockbuster films that the entire world waits to watch so when Time: 20:10 - 20:20 Marvel announced in 2017 that there was going to be an Avengers video game through this cryptic reveal trailer fans went wild it racked up views the Time: 20:20 - 20:30 expectations were mountainous they had to deliver that same quality into this game but they didn't the end result that we got in 2020 after three full years of teasing was not a hulking success see Time: 20:30 - 20:40 it's easy to look at this company licensing The Avengers name for a game as taking the easy way out but I would actually say that the Towering Heights Time: 20:40 - 20:50 of this IP was actually the main hurdle here for example immediately noticeable to anyone who's watched the movies was that these game characters actors don't look the same presumably because it was Time: 20:50 - 21:00 too expensive to license the real faces of the actors that people had gotten used to so right out the gate this was likened to a knockoff version of Marvel Time: 21:00 - 21:10 secondly there's the pressure of if we're licensing The Avengers name then we've got to make sure we properly monetize that opportunity so instead of this game being really character driven or story focused it ended up leaning Time: 21:10 - 21:20 much more heavily on being a multiplayer focused live service game that encourag you to buy in-game items with real money I think fortnite just worse but also Time: 21:20 - 21:30 because Marvel is such a huge machine there are many moving Parts they're also scheduling Comics movies merch uh other events at the same time as this game is Time: 21:30 - 21:40 being developed and so there's quite a strict development timeline and as a result the developers couldn't make enough original content and so what you actually end up doing in this game is fighting the same enemies in the same Time: 21:40 - 21:50 locations again and again and again it just wasn't fun and the stats show that for some perspective the game counter- strike regularly Hits 1 million people Time: 21:50 - 22:00 playing at any one time this game started out with just 28,000 concurrent players but within 2 months was on just 1,800 they did promise to add in more Time: 22:00 - 22:10 content the kind of content that should have really been there at launch in a later update but really once you've lost someone in a video game they're not coming back oh yeah and then the game Time: 22:10 - 22:20 had an update that accidentally started publicly displaying people's IP addresses could you imagine if you're a famous streamer logging on to Twitch to to stream with your fans but then Time: 22:20 - 22:30 without realizing it you accidentally give them your location this game was not just a commercial flop but also a security risk earning at a glorious 7 out of 10 Time: 22:30 - 22:40 fail all righty there's a pretty good chance that you remember Blockbuster see back in the day the way people would consume videos at home was to go into a VHS store have a flick through their 50 Time: 22:40 - 22:50 or so different vide tapes on offer and then just pick one of them that they liked to buy or rent I know I sound like a right dinosaur but Blockbuster they came onto the scene with a new strategy Time: 22:50 - 23:00 an Innovative new barcode system that could automatically keep track of up to 10,000 different vide tapes per store who had taken out what and when each person needed to return their tape the Time: 23:00 - 23:10 system was great for consumers because they had more Choice than ever and it was great for Blockbuster because they could charge every single person who was late to return their tapes a $40 penalty Time: 23:10 - 23:20 it was an overnight success literally the first day Blockbuster opened they had to lock the doors to keep the crowd down and before long Blockbuster were opening a new store per day what Time: 23:20 - 23:30 happened was Netflix but probably not the Netflix you know of the fun fact that company actually started in 1997 by using the postal service to ship people Time: 23:30 - 23:40 DVDs that they could then watch and return by mail and I realize that sounds like a bit of a faf but they had it all mapped out see when you signed up to Time: 23:40 - 23:50 Netflix you start paying a $20 monthly fee and you make a list of movies that you want to watch and next business day three of those movies will arrive at your doorstep and you can keep them for Time: 23:50 - 24:00 as long as you want no $40 late penalty fee but because you're paying monthly anyways and because you're only allowed to keep three DVDs at a time maximum you would actually want to keep sending them Time: 24:00 - 24:10 back so you can get through as many movies as possible and get your money's worth not as easy as what we have today but enough to spell the beginning of the end for Blockbuster who are two caught up in their initial success and trying Time: 24:10 - 24:20 to build more and more of these brick and mortar stores to notice the rug being pulled from under their feet and when they finally did notice and they realized I that Netflix had the better strategy they tried to copy them only Time: 24:20 - 24:30 then to get sued for patent infringement deserving I think of a seven out of 10 fail Okay this may come as a surprise to no one given that it's their fifth guest Time: 24:30 - 24:40 appearance in a single fails video but Microsoft had a pretty rough time in the 2000s but I think Windows Vista was their biggest misstep see Microsoft was Time: 24:40 - 24:50 very aware that people liked Windows XP but at the same time they were getting a bit antsy because they knew that there hadn't been a major overhaul in a really long long time and I'm going to be Time: 24:50 - 25:00 honest with you from a design perspective I think Vista and the arrow theme it brought in was pretty accomplished the transparency of Windows and the subtlety of color gave it a much lighter feel it did look like we just Time: 25:00 - 25:10 jumped into the future overnight however because of how rushed Windows Vista was developers weren't given enough time to probably optimize their applications for it so people were Time: 25:10 - 25:20 updating and then literally finding that they couldn't do their work anymore and that this new focus on design had come at the cost cost of performance compared Time: 25:20 - 25:30 to XP Vista required eight times as much RAM to run it was such a jump in required specs that Microsoft had to start adding stickers onto certain machines to guarantee that they were in fact capable of handling Vista but then Time: 25:30 - 25:40 ended up in a legal battle because even within those machines not all of them could even run the full Vista feature set and while all this was happening the Time: 25:40 - 25:50 nail in the coffin was that Apple capitalized on vista's flailing reputation with the famous iMac adverts they took all the major and even the minor problems in Windows at the time Time: 25:50 - 26:00 and turned Microsoft into a joke ensuing a full 2 years of persistent pummeling to an already dying piece of software Microsoft probably did break a few Windows after this one 7 out of 10 all Time: 26:00 - 26:10 right okay Nintendo for the most part really is a Visionary company time and time again they've proved that they Time: 26:10 - 26:20 understand the essence of what makes a game fun like some of my fondest childhood memories are literally sitting in a playground with my school friends connecting our game boys via a cable so Time: 26:20 - 26:30 we could play multiplayer Mario Kart but in 1995 Nintendo made the biggest misstep of their entire history they saw the growing interest in gaming obviously Time: 26:30 - 26:40 but also virtual reality and decided it was time to fuse worlds enter the virtual boy can you imagine the level of hype after how successful the original game boy was except the end product they Time: 26:40 - 26:50 came out with wasn't actually virtual reality it was just stereoscopic 3D pretty similar to just sticking on one of those red and blue glasses in the cinema the only colors it could display Time: 26:50 - 27:00 were red and black and the worst part to avoid potential lawsuits from people wearing these on their face and bumping into things the headset had to be attached to this stand and the way to Time: 27:00 - 27:10 use it was you had to kind of sit down next to it on a table and lean your neck into it it's not entirely surprising then that as well as the console's premise its success was also virtual you Time: 27:10 - 27:20 thought the Wii U sold badly at 13 million units this thing sold just 770,000 wasn't there's an up to a port here to be able to connect two virtual Time: 27:20 - 27:30 boys together for multiplayer but this thing flopped so quickly that the connector to go in that Port didn't even have time to come out did you know that alphabet the company behind Google tried Time: 27:30 - 27:40 to get affordable internet access to every single person on Earth especially those with the worst network infrastructure and little access to traditional cell towers using high altitude balloons sent to the Time: 27:40 - 27:50 stratosphere it was appropriately called Project Loon and there was so much Merit here because these balloons could get much higher than traditional cell towers each one was capable of providing a 25m Time: 27:50 - 28:00 radius of people on the ground with 3G speeds and because they were above the clouds they could be powered entirely by solar energy but sadly just this year Time: 28:00 - 28:10 alphabet announced that having burnt through a billion dollars Lon had popped mostly for regulatory reasons some countries had no problem at all allowing Time: 28:10 - 28:20 all these internet balloons in their airspace but other countries told them to go do one and so this hurt the efficiency of the project it meant that instead of having a whole interconnected Time: 28:20 - 28:30 web of balloons everywhere that could all communicate and send signals between them to wherever needed we'd end up having one separated cluster of balloons over here one of them over here one of them over here and at that point you Time: 28:30 - 28:40 might as well just manually build the infrastructure so I'm giving this one a s out of 10 fail inflated because of a how much money was lost but also B how Time: 28:40 - 28:50 much alphabet and Google were talking up this project all right number three is quite possibly the largest social media blunder to date so what happened was Time: 28:50 - 29:00 back in 2014 hundreds of thousands of Americans were served up a quiz it asked them questions about their behavior and psychology as well as that of their friends and it made people log into their Facebook accounts to submit that Time: 29:00 - 29:10 quiz what these people didn't realize though is that by doing so they were basically allowing someone to combine that behavioral data from their quiz with their personal info from their Facebook page including their photos Time: 29:10 - 29:20 into a complete psychometric profile of themselves and every other person connected to them through a few hundred, people taking this quiz a personality Time: 29:20 - 29:30 profile could be built for every single living American but what made it so much worse was that this data was then given to a data mining firm called Cambridge analytica who were at the time working on Donald Trump's campaign for president Time: 29:30 - 29:40 and they use this extra info about people to Target tailored political advertising to them things like what kind of messaging they would respond to and how many times they need to see that Time: 29:40 - 29:50 messaging so that they would end up voting the way that Cambridge analytica wanted them to this was horrific news for Facebook because even though they weren't the ones doing the bad thing it Time: 29:50 - 30:00 was their platform that let it happen it was their responsibility to make sure that user data was protected they didn't do that and as a consequence was slapped with one of the biggest fines in history Time: 30:00 - 30:10 for misconduct at $5 billion oh yeah and a worldwide trending campaign to delete Facebook well you know what they say all press is good press unless your Facebook Time: 30:10 - 30:20 8 out of 10 fail all right number two revolves around a guy called Billy McFarland who through a semi-successful startup company managed to network with some Time: 30:20 - 30:30 pretty powerful people and one day him and a few of those people had an idea to create a music festival two weeks of just pure luxury on a private island with endless gourmet food luxury villas Time: 30:30 - 30:40 white beaches and a guest list full of celebrities they paid hundreds of influencers to talk up this so-called fire Festival including people like Kendall Jenner and Bella Hadid and it Time: 30:40 - 30:50 wasn't long before the entire thing sold out oh do you want to know how much the tickets were by the way up to $250,000 per Time: 30:50 - 31:00 person yep that much it's the kind of money that most normal people can't even think about but to be fair this opportunity to share a private island Time: 31:00 - 31:10 with the most famous people on the planet that's not normally something that money can even buy so to the people who had the money it's worth it but what had happened here was that all the promises were made and tickets sold Time: 31:10 - 31:20 before Billy and team had actually thought about costs and when they did that they realized that they didn't have enough cuz yes while the top end tickets were extor at in trying to get the numbers up they sold the majority of Time: 31:20 - 31:30 them at closer to $11,000 so they couldn't build people's luxury villas people arrived on the island only to realize that they had a tent there was no food people were literally starving Time: 31:30 - 31:40 and so the staff decided to distract them from this fact by shoving bottles of tequila down their throats but that is literally a recipe for casualties every single one of the major music appearance they told people would be Time: 31:40 - 31:50 there were complete no- shows and some of the ones on the list hadn't even confirmed in the first place this private island was actually the empty space behind a bunch of hotels on a Time: 31:50 - 32:00 public Island and they didn't tell people whose tent was whose so people arrived expecting luxury but actually ended up having a free-for-all and needing to steal mattresses to make sure Time: 32:00 - 32:10 that they had a place to sleep this was a war zone Plus on top of all of that people were instructed to put all of their money onto this fire bracelet because it was going to be a cashless Festival except when people arrived they Time: 32:10 - 32:20 realized that because the festival was off there was no one on the island who was willing to take payments from it and there was no way to get the money off by every metric this was a horrific Time: 32:20 - 32:30 experience for people but Justice was served with a $100 million class action lawsuit against Billy and then another lawsuit and then seven more Time: 32:30 - 32:40 lawsuits then he was charged for fraud and given six years in prison eight out of 10 now just before fail number one do remember that this is Time: 32:40 - 32:50 only one of like seven different Tech fails videos so if your favorite fail isn't in this one it might well be on those ones and I'll leave them linked from from here so number one is the UK's response Time: 32:50 - 33:00 to co I'm being deadly serious so the government had this idea that National lockdowns are terrible for the economy Time: 33:00 - 33:10 true so what we're going to do is develop a test and trace app that can enforce individual lockdowns that can keep track of exactly who has covid and therefore who needs to isolate because Time: 33:10 - 33:20 they've been in contact with those people oh that sounds like a good idea how much you going to spend on that 22 billion excuse me to give you some perspective Time: 33:20 - 33:30 22 billion is enough money to buy not one but two PlayStation Fires for every single house in the country it could provide 1.1 million jobs or according to Time: 33:30 - 33:40 the crisis charity is twice as much money needed to end homelessness but do you wonder what the funny part is they decided partway through development that 22 billion wasn't enough and so they've Time: 33:40 - 33:50 already burnt through 37 and their app has not done its one and only job to prevent National lockdown we've already had two more since it started it's a Time: 33:50 - 34:00 completely broken system the goal was to log when someone was identified to have Co and then using a smartphone notification instantly alert that person and everyone around them to stay in Time: 34:00 - 34:10 their homes but at best this app is only reaching about 50% of the contacts of the person who has covid so half of them are being told to isolate and half of Time: 34:10 - 34:20 these people are almost being reassured that actually they are in fact fine when they're not not only that but the process is so drawn out that it's on average taking a week after someone Time: 34:20 - 34:30 becomes infectious for their app to tell them that they should be isolating Which is far too late because at that point they could well have infected tens more people and they could well have been Time: 34:30 - 34:40 infectious for so long that they're not infectious anymore but it's that point at which they're being told to stay at home but on top of all of that the data being fed to the app the backbone of Time: 34:40 - 34:50 this operation is Microsoft Excel and not the new one Exel 199 97 a lot of data from test is being stored using Time: 34:50 - 35:00 this program but because it has a limit of 65,000 rows we've actually had a point where new people were getting tested and were getting results but the system couldn't record them because Time: 35:00 - 35:10 they' reached maximum cell capacity so basically we thought cases were looking like this when they should have actually been looking like this now don't get me wrong this is not an easy system to Time: 35:10 - 35:20 create but that doesn't change the fact that what we did end up getting was not just immeasurably wasteful but also genuinely gave people a false sense of security that has been shown to be more Time: 35:20 - 35:30 damaging nine out of 10 fail the only way it could have possibly been worse is maybe if someone was deliberately doing it I know it might look like it but I Time: 35:30 - 35:40 genuinely think this is just immeasurably poor planning on a scale never before seen they like my videos If you enjoyed this then I'm going to leave a ton of tech fail videos linked from this one do Time: 35:40 - 35:50 check them out they'll be all around here my name is Aaron this is Mr who's the boss I'll catch you in the next one [Music] Time: 35:50 - 36:00My favourite addition to the Track and Trace app was that it also didn't take into account vertical distance, so if you're on the bottom floor of a skyscraper, and someone pings 100 floors up, guess what: you've got covid!",
