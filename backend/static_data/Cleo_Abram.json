      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:05 Here I am seeing a real life quantum computer for the very first time with my friend and king of tech YouTube, Marques Bradley. Time: 00:09 - 00:17 And I'm finally understanding Time: 00:17 - 00:19 why quantum computers are such a big deal. Quantum computers. Quantum technology. What on Earth is a quantum computer? Bits, qubits try all the codes at once. Whichever nation's first developed a practical quantum computer will have a tremendous advantage. Quantum supremacy. I see a lot of news about quantum computers, and it's always extremely confusing. That was really well done, and I still need to rehear it. But also, it's often Time: 00:19 - 00:44 wrong. Quantum computers aren't supercomputers. They aren't bigger, faster versions of what we use now. They're something totally different, and that difference is actually the key to understanding why they're such a big deal, why governments around the world are battling it out to build them the fastest. Time: 00:44 - 00:59 Quantum computers are wild. They're on track to change what we can build and how we understand the world. They're kept at temperatures colder than space. But if you think you really understand how they work, you're probably wrong. At least, I didn't. And that's where this video starts. Marques and I both realized that there was this big important technology Time: 01:00 - 01:19 that we really didn't understand. Time: 01:20 - 01:22 So we decided to go on an adventure to figure out the truth about quantum computers, what they can really do, Time: 01:22 - 01:28 and why we should care. And of course, we're taking you on that adventure with us to show you what we learn as we learn it, and more importantly, to show you how these crazy computers might actually impact your life, and Time: 01:28 - 01:40 sooner than Time: 01:41 - 01:42 you think. So her niche skill we just got, which is being able to hear when an awesome computer is working. What does it what does it sound like? Time: 01:45 - 01:51 So it works. It's not broken. Time: 02:03 - 02:05 I swear I'm usually good with tech, but Time: 02:05 - 02:07 Like, the only function of this Time: 02:08 - 02:10 screen is to provide directions. You're getting Time: 02:11 - 02:14 this? Time: 02:15 - 02:16 So we're going to visit IBM's quantum computer. This is really exciting that they're letting us see this computer because Time: 02:16 - 02:22 it is, to my knowledge, the largest quantum computer that exists, which I say with confidence. Like, I know what that means. I was gonna say, what is biggest? Because, like, I heard you know, like, supercomputers, Time: 02:23 - 02:32 they're they're massive rooms full of computers. And I when someone says we have the biggest supercomputer, I'm like, oh, I can picture that. The largest quantum computer, I'm not even sure what to picture. I imagine the golden octopus. You know, that thing that Biden looked at like this? Depress images. Yeah. Yeah. And I know that in order to see that, they have to shut down the computer. So this is like took some real Time: 02:32 - 02:52 logistics on their part to allow us to do it. A real deal. What is most interesting to you about Time: 02:53 - 02:58 quantum computing? It's definitely on the edge of my Time: 02:58 - 03:02 expertise, I would say. I'm really curious about when it's actually gonna touch, like, regular people. Yeah. My whole concern is purchase decisions. Thank you. At some point in the future, quantum computing will come into play with a real purchase decision. Someone will have, like, a a device that they can buy where quantum computing is a part of it or maybe went into its its creation at least. When are we gonna get to that point? One of the things that I think is very important to make clear is this is a different kind of explainer. You're just coming with us as we figure this out. Exploratory explainer. Exactly. Yeah. It's a whole new genre. Along for this adventure are Cody and Nicole. Nicole is an associate producer on this episode who is also studying quantum communication for her PhD. And Cody is our DP, the man behind the camera. Thank God they're both here. So when I started doing this episode, Time: 03:03 - 03:48 I spoke to a really famous quantum physicist. He was really frustrated at the way that people were talking about quantum computers. And I was like, okay. How do you want people to think about them like them? Okay. Here's the analogy that helps me understand what quantum computers are good for. Imagine that you're on a video game map, and how you get around depends on how good you are at doing math. Time: 03:48 - 04:08 You may not wanna play this video game. Bear with me. So first, there were no computers. Things like geometry and astronomy took forever. So you have your little pencil and paper, and you're traveling across the mathematical map by walking. So it was slow, and there were lots of areas that we just couldn't explore because it was beyond our computational ability. But then we developed early computers, and that allowed us to input larger datasets and answer problems that had previously been out Time: 04:08 - 04:33 out of reach. These new computers unlocked new areas on our mathematical map. Instead of walking everywhere, we can now ride horses. We can get farther, faster, and we can access areas that were previously inaccessible. Time: 04:35 - 04:44 But there were still parts of the map that our computers couldn't access. Luckily, computers just kept getting better, and they allowed us to solve more and more complex math problems. As a result, our virtual map has transformed. Time: 04:44 - 04:55 We have roads and cars, and we're just reaching areas that were previously Time: 04:56 - 05:00 unreachable. Better computers mean traveling across this map faster and more easily than ever. The thing that he said was really important to understand is that quantum computers are not Time: 05:01 - 05:10 faster cars. Time: 05:10 - 05:11 They're boats. Time: 05:12 - 05:13 A boat is not necessarily better than a car. They're just built for totally different terrain. So with our new quantum computers, we're beginning to navigate these new mathematical Time: 05:14 - 05:23 waters, Time: 05:24 - 05:25 solving problems and discovering areas that traditional computers just can't. My question for IBM is Time: 05:25 - 05:31 what's in the water? Time: 05:32 - 05:33 Oh, wow. What are the oceans Time: 05:33 - 05:35 that we're all of a sudden able to explore with our quantum computer boats? I love this. I'm an analogy person, so I'm, like, fully absorbed in this now. This is why I think a quantum computer is never gonna beat an iPhone. But I think that this is a better thing to offer Time: 05:36 - 05:51 the audience, like, to offer you guys instead of, like, quantum computers are Time: 05:51 - 05:55 just another exciting computer. I guess what people are probably clicking on this video thinking in their head is, will there really never ever be a quantum computer in my pocket? And I guess that would be, will there ever be a flying car boat? You know? Is the tech ever gonna get to that point? Just a question. I just wanna say I really appreciate your commitment to this. I love it. I love the analogy. Time: 05:56 - 06:17 Guys, we have arrived. Time: 06:18 - 06:19 Where have we arrived to? This does not look like there's a quantum computer here. IBM research division. Time: 06:20 - 06:26 Here we go. Time: 06:27 - 06:28 Alright. Time: 06:29 - 06:30 Let's go. Let's go see a quantum computer. We made it. We're here. Here we go. Do you wanna introduce yourself first? Oh, sure. Olivia, audience, audience, Olivia. Hi. I'm Olivia Lanes. Time: 06:32 - 06:42 I'm a researcher Time: 06:42 - 06:43 at IBM, and I also work on the education and the community team. We're gonna go look for a quantum computer. Time: 06:44 - 06:49 What's going on here? This is our Watson set up. No, please go ahead. This is, like, where the Watson Time: 06:55 - 07:01 in AI thing was displayed and it like competed on Jeopardy with like Ken Jennings. Watson, what is Chu? You are right. This is Brent. Time: 07:02 - 07:10 It's Brent's lab. So it's very nice of him too. Great to meet you. Let us say Thanks for having us. Time: 07:11 - 07:16 So this is the Time: 07:16 - 07:18 lab. Time: 07:18 - 07:19 That's a quantum computer? Yeah. Actually, this is a dilution refrigerator. This whole thing is basically constructed Time: 07:19 - 07:25 to keep the quantum computer very, very cold. 15 millikelvin. Time: 07:26 - 07:29 It's the coldest thing basically in the universe. It's colder than outer space. So inside that Time: 07:29 - 07:35 is 15 millikelvin. Yep. Time: 07:35 - 07:37 So here, let me show you the one that we can, like, play with. Time: 07:39 - 07:42 This is it. This this is a quantum computer. This is a quantum computer. Time: 07:42 - 07:46 The quantum computer is a chip in this one here. Yeah. But this whole thing Time: 07:50 - 07:54 keeps the quantum computer working at insanely cold temperatures like we talked about. So this is all refrigerator technology? Time: 07:55 - 08:02 So all of these cables that you see here on the side carry signals Time: 08:03 - 08:07 down through the fridge into the processor, and then they do their their quantum stuff, and it comes up. And it goes to these room temperature control electronics, and they turn it into things that humans can understand. That is a quantum computer. Time: 08:08 - 08:22 We were allowed to touch it, which was cool. Oh my god. So I think it's really funny that when people generally talk about, like, the difference between classical and quantum computers, people are like, okay. Well, you know how a classical computer works. Right? But, like, the truth is that, like, nobody knows that. A simplification of it is it comes down to bits. Time: 08:23 - 08:40 And bits are made out of pieces of silicon and you have, you know, tens of thousands to millions of them in your computer. Time: 08:41 - 08:47 And they can either be in the state zero or one. We call it the ground state or the excited state. And everything that you type into your computer, like all words, all numbers, all colors, Time: 08:48 - 08:57 get translated into computer speech, but it's very binary. Right? A quantum computer is run on qubits. Qubits aren't like bits. They aren't a one or a zero. They're more complex. Time: 08:57 - 09:08 Think of this like a wave. A qubit could be really likely to be zero, which means a lower energy wave, or it could be really likely to be one, which means a higher energy wave. And each qubit has a probability of being each. When a quantum computer is working, the probabilities of multiple qubits interact. And they add constructively or destructively, just like waves would. If you were to, like, Time: 09:09 - 09:32 tap, like, two places in a pond. You know how when you, like, explain something to a two year old and they just keep going, why? And they have to explain again and you go, why? Yeah. My question is, as the controller of Time: 09:32 - 09:43 the computer, you decide Time: 09:44 - 09:46 what about those probabilities? Time: 09:46 - 09:48 Basically, you are altering the probabilities while you're running an algorithm. It's a common misconception that quantum computers try all the options. That's not right. This is simplified, but it's more like a quantum computer kind of watches the pond. It watches how all of those waves interact and then finds the most likely answer. If this is all confusing, don't worry. All you really need to know is that quantum computers calculate things very differently than classical computers do, and that makes them good at different things. Quantum computers are not gonna be faster at everything than a classical computer. Like, it's not good for addition. Right? Because your calculator and your phone is perfectly good at that. But the things that quantum computers are good at is finding Time: 09:49 - 10:29 structure Time: 10:30 - 10:30 in tons of data. And if you're interested, Time: 10:31 - 10:34 we can close it back up. Absolutely. Time: 10:34 - 10:36 Put us to work. Time: 10:37 - 10:38 Yeah. Time: 10:45 - 10:46 Let's go back to our virtual map. So we have our boats and we're floating around discovering new parts of this map. One of the first new areas of interest is simulating nature. Time: 10:47 - 10:56 Simulation of nature seems really interesting. Why is nature one of the things? So nature fundamentally Time: 10:57 - 11:01 is quantum and it obeys quantum physics. We just don't normally see it. Time: 11:02 - 11:07 But if you look at, like, atomic Time: 11:08 - 11:09 structure of molecules, Time: 11:11 - 11:13 everything has to follow the laws of quantum physics. It's really hard to calculate Time: 11:13 - 11:18 what a material or what an atom is going to do Time: 11:19 - 11:22 past a certain size. So at a certain point, it just can't do it. But if you're interested in, like, developing battery technology Time: 11:22 - 11:29 or creating new materials Time: 11:30 - 11:31 that have, you know, long chains of molecules, Time: 11:32 - 11:35 you're gonna need a quantum computer. This is why people are so excited. Think of the new materials Time: 11:35 - 11:40 or medicines or molecules that we could make if we could better predict the way that nature behaves at a molecular scale. Time: 11:40 - 11:47 Oh, yeah. Time: 11:54 - 11:54 Yeah. There you go. Time: 12:00 - 12:01 Boom. Time: 12:02 - 12:02 Okay. So simulating nature Time: 12:03 - 12:05 is something that quantum computers could be amazing at, but we're also getting closer to another use for quantum computing, one that people Time: 12:05 - 12:13 and governments Time: 12:13 - 12:14 are more concerned about. Two completely new encryption algorithms. Break encryption of quantum resistant encryption. A fully functional quantum computer could be built with code breaking capabilities that could render all forms of online encryption unreliable. Time: 12:15 - 12:28 Okay. Now this is the one that I've been waiting to ask about. Okay. Why Time: 12:28 - 12:32 is everybody so obsessed with talking about quantum computers and encryption? So the first Time: 12:33 - 12:38 major algorithm that was developed for quantum computers is Shor's algorithm, named after Peter Shor. Super nice guy. He invented an algorithm which basically can find Time: 12:39 - 12:49 prime factors for really large numbers. Why does anyone care about this? Because that's the basis for RSA encryption, which is basically how all transactions on the Internet are conducted. And the entire reason that all of our encryption schemes today work that way is because it's basically impossible Time: 12:49 - 13:06 to crack that with a brute force classical algorithm. It would take I think it's, like, billions of years, but a quantum computer could do that way more efficiently. Time: 13:07 - 13:16 So this global race now makes a ton of sense. Time: 13:19 - 13:21 Whoever gets a quantum computer to actually do this has a big obvious advantage. But we haven't done that yet. That's one of the ones that requires probably, like, a million cubits or more to do, but we're working up to it. So we're not gonna be using quantum computers to break all Internet security right now. Today, we're at 433 Time: 13:21 - 13:41 cubits, the record set by IBM. Time: 13:41 - 13:43 Four hundred to a million qubits is a big difference, but Olivia is confident that we'll get there sooner than you think. In the next five or even less years, we're gonna see people switching over to quantum safe algorithms because of this reason. So RSA Time: 13:43 - 13:58 goes away and we have quantum safe Time: 13:58 - 14:00 encryption instead? Probably. Not all at once. Yeah. But gradually, Time: 14:01 - 14:05 you're gonna see people do it. We're progressing Time: 14:05 - 14:08 at an incredibly fast rate. We're solving problems that people didn't even begin to know how to crack two years ago. But we've done it. Like, every single year, everything that we say we do, Time: 14:08 - 14:18 we do. Nothing mathematically or physically prevents it. And so if the physics says it's allowed, the engineers will find a way. That's sick. I'm picturing I'm adjusting the analogy slightly Time: 14:18 - 14:31 that it's submarine Time: 14:32 - 14:33 because there are sort of different levels of quantum computing. Yeah. We are just skimming the surface. We're gonna keep iterating and improving upon this technology every single year. And we're probably gonna discover, Time: 14:35 - 14:47 like, new applications that we haven't even considered yet. It's a bottomless ocean. It's a bottomless ocean. Time: 14:48 - 14:53 The tour was amazing. And as we left, we thought about what we learned. Awesome. Let me just get on the highway. I'm gonna have Time: 14:55 - 15:01 thoughts. Quantum computers do look exactly like I imagined they look. They look like the pictures. Like the picture. Yep. But something about being in person with it was just like, oh, helped me understand that this is a fundamentally different technology. Time: 15:03 - 15:14 Like, it just looks so weird. I'm really glad I got to finish exploring that analogy and fully understand it too and adjust it a little bit to, like, really Time: 15:14 - 15:23 encapsulate Time: 15:24 - 15:24 at least everything that I currently understand about quantum computers Time: 15:24 - 15:27 in that there is an evolution to the future of them and that they are specialized and really good at certain things. Time: 15:28 - 15:34 Just, Time: 15:35 - 15:35 I like a good analogy, so that helped a lot. Okay. So what is your summary of the analogy now? I think we can keep almost all of it, which is that our exploration of other Time: 15:36 - 15:45 fields of mathematics and physics and science Time: 15:46 - 15:48 was equivalent to other steadily advancing forms of transportation around our imaginary video game island, but I like adjusting to submarine because Time: 15:49 - 15:56 there are levels to it. It's more of a bottomless ocean in that we're just gonna keep going. The tech gets better. There is no physical limit. It just continues to improve. Here's how Olivia put the dream of how we'd actually use quantum computers. It's beautiful because, like, of course, we all wanna make the world a better place. We wanna develop technology that's gonna enable us to do fundamentally Time: 15:57 - 16:16 different and better things. But it's also beautiful because, like, part of the human experience is you just wanna, like, learn what we are and, like, learn more about the world we live in. And the fact is the world is quantum mechanical. Time: 16:16 - 16:28 There you have it. Thanks for coming. Time: 16:28 - 16:31 This episode was so much fun to make. I Huge If True is a genuinely optimistic, journalistically rigorous show about finding ways to use technology to make the world better. If that's something that you believe in, the best thing that you can do to support us is to subscribe. And if you like this episode you definitely should subscribe because Marquez and I already have another adventure planned. Also if you subscribe leave a comment and let me know I'd love to meet you. See you for the next one. Time: 16:33 - 16:56 I could live in this analogy forever. What’s in the water? How deep is the water?! Are there other islands we haven’t discovered yet? Still processing everything we learned 🤓",

      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:20 kept going for twenty years. They made it about a third of the way through Earth's crust and then Time: 00:20 - 00:27 stopped. Time: 00:28 - 00:28 But what Time: 00:29 - 00:30 if you just kept Time: 00:30 - 00:32 digging? If you dug a hole all the way to the center of the Earth, Time: 00:32 - 00:36 what would you find? Time: 00:37 - 00:38 What would happen to you? And what does our newest tech tell us is really going on down below our feet? Feet? Let's take a look at what's inside. Journey to the center of the Earth. Went where no human being had ever set foot. No. No. No. No. No. No. The center of the Earth. The heat and the pressure. What's underneath the Earth's crust is different. The deeper you go into the Earth, the hotter it gets. That's Time: 00:38 - 00:58 wild. Time: 00:58 - 00:59 Imagine we go outside, and we just start digging. At about 50 meters deep, we might start to feel the temperature go up. Every kilometer through the crust is about 25 degrees Celsius hotter. Right now, we're inside the crust. On land, it's typically less than 40 kilometers deep, which is less than the length of a marathon. We're passing through soil and layers of hard rock, past precious metals and fossils. And as we get deeper, we start to see all kinds of impressively deep things that people have built. Like, there's the Kamioka and Sanford Research Labs that do dark matter and neutrino physics research, Time: 01:08 - 01:37 or there's China's insanely deep nuclear command bunker. Time: 01:37 - 01:40 There's the deepest cave we've ever discovered, Time: 01:41 - 01:43 plus some of the deepest mines in the world. As we go deeper, temperature and pressure continue to rise. But by this point, unprotected just in the Earth, we were crushed and crispy a while ago. To go farther, let's equip ourselves with an imaginary drilling machine that's immune to any temperature or pressure. Time: 01:44 - 02:00 Now finally, at 12.2 Time: 02:00 - 02:02 kilometers, we reach the deepest point humans have ever dug. This is that hole the USSR dug, the Kula Superdeep Borehole. They didn't put any humans down here. This equipment was operated remotely. To get so deep, these scientists had to invent new equipment and drilling methods to pierce through the thick, hot, pressurized rock. Along the way, they discovered new fossilized organisms dating back 2,000,000,000 years and found there was water much deeper than scientists previously thought. We actually emailed three of the scientists who worked on this project, and one of them told us, quote, the Russians tried several times to get down past the maximum depth that they had reached, but each time, the new hole tended to collapse. Time: 02:02 - 02:38 This was a moonshot, which will never be repeated or surpassed. This is so cool. But the craziest part is Time: 02:38 - 02:45 this deepest hole that humans have ever dug is only point 2% Time: 02:45 - 02:50 of the way to the center of the Earth. Time: 02:50 - 02:52 Time to go deeper. Time: 02:52 - 02:53 At about 30 to 50 kilometers down, we notice that the rock around us is changing. We're crossing into the mantle. At first, the rock around us looks really brittle. Like the crust, but denser. But as we get a little deeper, as the temperature rises over 1,300 Time: 02:56 - 03:11 degrees Celsius, something weird starts to happen. The rock around us starts to look like hot plastic. Time: 03:11 - 03:17 Here, the temperature is higher than the melting point of the rock, but the pressure is so high that it's still keeping the rock solid. It's gooey. Time: 03:18 - 03:26 We're now starting to push through even hotter material. It's slowly inching from the bottom of the mantle toward the top in these giant convection currents over millions of years. And you might be wondering, why is the Earth hot? Well, it's partly radiation and partly leftover heat from when the Earth formed by meteorites smashing against each other over and over again. The Earth is cooling Time: 03:26 - 03:48 very, very slowly, but we don't need to worry about that. It's gonna take billions of years. In the meantime, this stirring of hot goop brings enormous amounts of heat from the center toward the crust. Time: 03:48 - 03:59 But hang on. Time: 04:01 - 04:02 How do we know that? If humans have only ever been Time: 04:03 - 04:06 12 kilometers down, how do we know that? Yeah. That's a great question. That's doctor Megan Newcomb, a geologist and volcanologist Time: 04:06 - 04:14 at the University of Maryland. She told me that studying the deep Earth is like being a detective. We can't get there, so we have to put together all of these indirect pieces of evidence to work out what's going on down there. Ancient scientists had a lot of theories about what was going on down there. Some thought the earth contained a central fire with underground lakes and lava chambers. Some thought it was hollow, maybe a set of concentric shells with life on each ring. This is the basis for the hollow Earth in the Godzilla movies. Isaac Newton suggested that based on observable gravity, the stuff in the center must be denser than the stuff at the top. But it wasn't until the early twentieth century that scientists could prove that the Earth had a central core and that there were several different layers above it. These breakthrough discoveries were thanks in large part to earthquakes. During an earthquake, we feel it up here, but it's also sending seismic waves down. They are just like sound waves, but there are two main varieties. Time: 04:14 - 05:06 There's p waves and s waves. P waves can travel through liquids and solids, but s waves can only travel through solids. They also behave differently depending on the density of the rock that they're moving through, which means that by measuring what waves end up at different detectors all over the surface, scientists can understand what's going on between them. That's one big way that we've learned about how the mantle differs from the crust, and it also taught scientists something else. We find this s wave shadow on the opposite side of the planet that tells us that for some reason, the s waves couldn't propagate all the way through the earth. And that tells us that there's a liquid layer down there. That liquid layer is part of what we now call the outer core. Time: 05:06 - 05:47 We've now crossed into a liquid soup of metals, cooking at around 4,400 Time: 05:50 - 05:54 degrees Celsius. Here, temperature has won the fight against pressure, and we should all be extremely grateful for the hot metal soup down there because its constant churning generates enormous electric currents, which in turn create the magnetic field around the Earth. And without that cosmic radiation would just end all life as we know it on the surface. But this gets weirder. Our magnetic field sometimes actually just reverses. The Time: 05:54 - 06:14 because Time: 06:23 - 06:23 You can actually read off all of those magnetic reversals on the ocean floor. Time: 06:24 - 06:29 Yeah. As basalt is erupted along our mid ocean ridges, it freezes in a record of what the magnetic field was at that time. And as the plates continue to get created and pulled apart, we can read them off like a barcode. So what you're telling me is there's a barcode Time: 06:30 - 06:45 for our magnetic fields at the bottom of the ocean, and scientists have learned to read it. Mhmm. Time: 06:45 - 06:51 Excellent. You can read this too. It flipped here. It flipped here. It flipped here. The last reversal was around 780,000 Time: 06:52 - 06:59 ago. When will it flip next? We're not sure. But I had a much more basic question about all of this. Why is the Earth in layers? You're gonna like this one. At the beginning, Time: 06:59 - 07:09 we were a magma ocean. The entire Earth was Time: 07:10 - 07:13 liquid. Time: 07:14 - 07:15 During that time, the densest materials, which are the iron metal, and sank and formed the core. And then the lightest Time: 07:15 - 07:23 minerals Time: 07:23 - 07:24 floated to the top, and the densest minerals settled to the bottom. And so we've segregated by density. Okay. We've almost made it through all of those layers. We are deep inside the Earth's outer core, and then Time: 07:24 - 07:37 you hit something. Time: 07:38 - 07:39 Hang on, though. If you're going on a real life adventure, you might wanna take this. This is my water bottle. This is the Lark PureVis two. And what's cool about it is that when I press Time: 07:39 - 07:48 this, Time: 07:49 - 07:49 it's purifying the water inside. It uses UV light to break down the chemical bonds of bacterial DNA, specifically E. Coli and salmonella. That keeps the inside clean Time: 07:50 - 07:57 compared to a water bottle without that. In this example here, they swab the inside of two water bottles used for four weeks. Lark is on the left, and a water bottle like the one I used to have is on the right. Then they waited to see what bacteria grows from each, and Time: 07:58 - 08:09 the PureVis two also has a plant based filter that removes pollutants. So better taste, healthier water. Plus, and this is my favorite part, it helps me remember to drink enough water. This is my real data from the last week. You can see I'm hitting my goal almost every day. The way this works is it has a little sensor in the cap that measures the water level inside after each sip, so I get real time insights on my progress. The light ring on the cap will light up to remind me to drink water, and you can set the frequency of that in the app. So I have mine set to every hour, hour. And it has a double wall insulation that keeps water cool for twenty four hours. Time: 08:10 - 08:41 If you wanna check it out, there's a link in my description. Now back to the story. Time: 08:42 - 08:45 At the very center of our planet, there is a solid metal ball that's almost as hot as the surface of the sun. And for a long time, we didn't know it was there. We assumed that everything in the core was molten because why would it be solid? But then these two scientists were studying more of those seismic waves, and they noticed that when those waves Time: 08:48 - 09:06 got Time: 09:06 - 09:07 to the center, they started to act Time: 09:07 - 09:10 weird. Waves were being bent and reflected by something in the middle. The math only made sense if there was a solid core inside the larger liquid one. Other scientists confirmed this theory with more precise recordings of the waves and better computational models. So why is it solid? Well, it turns out that the pressure here is so insanely high that the iron atoms literally can't move. And what's even stranger is that more recently, Time: 09:10 - 09:34 scientists have found slight discrepancies in the data that seem to show Earth's core is rotating at a different rate than we are at the surface, and that rate Time: 09:34 - 09:45 changes. Time: 09:45 - 09:46 It is speeding up and slowing down separately from what we're doing up here because Time: 09:47 - 09:49 Very precise seismic data and computer models of our magnetic fields show that the Earth's inner core seems to be speeding up and slowing down on a roughly seventy year cycle. You might have seen headlines that the Earth's core is reversing, Time: 09:55 - 10:06 but that's not true. It's just that if you were on the outside of the inner core and I'm on the surface, it would look to me like you were going the opposite direction if you're slowing down, even if we're both moving the same direction. But this iron core is no match for our magical digger. We are going straight through it until finally, Time: 10:06 - 10:23 we did it. We made it to the very center. We are now six thousand four four hundred kilometers from the surface. The pressure around us is 3,600,000 Time: 10:24 - 10:35 times what it is on the surface. But in lots of ways, what's around us right now is still a big mystery. Like is there an inner inner core? Some scientists think that there might be. There's new seismic data that suggests that the iron atoms are packed differently way on the inside, but others aren't so sure that that's enough to call it a new layer. We've been wrong before, but we're becoming better detectives. Can we predict the Earth's magnetic field and when it might flip? Scientists are building experiments that mimic the inner Earth to learn more. Now the cutting edge is finding new ways to analyze seismic waves with better computational models and even finding ways to replicate the deep earth conditions here on the surface. We are a curious species, Time: 10:35 - 11:14 locked on the outside of our own home, and we're doing everything we can to peek inside. That's what's so cool about science and technology. Time: 11:14 - 11:22 It lets us explore strange new worlds, Time: 11:22 - 11:25 including the one right below your feet. Time: 11:26 - 11:28Seeing Cleo get really excited about science makes me wish I had science teachers like her",

      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:01 All lines up. Brand new season, brand new tour for Formula one. I'm looking at the brand new car for the number one team of the world's most popular car racing sport, Formula one, with the current world champion driver, Max Verstappen. Would you like to come and see the car? Yes. And we're gonna show you what it takes to build and drive some of the fastest and most expensive cars in the world. Because the thing is, these aren't just cars. Think of them instead as epic group science projects where 10 teams all fight to be first. And on every team, there are hundreds of people spending millions of dollars all working together to push technology to its limit. In this video, I'm gonna give you rare access into the factory in England where they build these cars, and into a garage in Bahrain where they race them. This is Formula one cars explained. Time: 00:02 - 00:53 I am on my way to the Red Bull factory. We're gonna get into some of the nitty gritty engineering details, but we're also gonna talk about the basics of a formula one car. This is Jack. Jack's gonna get us us into all of the secret rooms. Time: 01:13 - 01:25 I will do my very best. He's doing a finger scan to get us in? Time: 01:25 - 01:29 So clear. Time: 01:30 - 01:31 Welcome to Red Bull. Time: 01:31 - 01:32 I don't even know what to say. Time: 01:38 - 01:39 This is badass. What should I look at? Everything. Time: 01:40 - 01:43 That's the purpose of it. The reason why we have this here is that when people arrive for work, they know what they're here to do, which is to win trophies. Yeah. Time: 01:43 - 01:50 Oh my god. So these are all Time: 01:51 - 01:55 race driven cars from our history in the sport. Time: 01:55 - 01:59 Starting the left hand side with our first car and then finishing on the right hand side with the RB 16 b, the 2021 championship winning car. Time: 02:00 - 02:08 The RB seven actually isn't here. And the reason for that is we do crazy things with the car. So you may have seen it do a donut on the top of the skyscraper. Time: 02:13 - 02:21 We've done a pit stop in zero gravity. Time: 02:22 - 02:24 Can I touch it? You can touch the car. It's fine. Time: 02:24 - 02:27 It's so beautiful. The driver actually has to spend about three or four hours Time: 02:29 - 02:33 sat down in the car Time: 02:33 - 02:35 getting their seat fitted. So we sit them in some clay, essentially, and they sort of get the seat formed around them. A formula one car looks kind of similar to other race cars that you might have seen, like these in IndyCar. Single seat, open cockpit, but there's something that makes a formula one car special. In IndyCar, all of the cars have to use the same frame or chassis. So winning really depends on how you race that car. But in Formula one, each team has to design and manufacture Time: 02:35 - 03:00 their own cars. So winning starts here at the factory with how you build your car. But you can't just build whatever you want. We design a car based on the regulations that the FIA and f one provide us. And so that really stipulates how the cars look, what shapes they are. That's the formula in formula one. Teams fight to find the best design within these rules. The incredible thing with Formula one for me is that you have 10 teams that come together to race. They've all designed and built their own individual car, but you arrive at the track and everybody's within, you know, a second of each other over a lap, which is quite incredible in itself. But the only way that you gain an advantage in Formula one when the margins are so slim is to look at every area that you can possibly can to eek performance. The rules say that each team can spend a hundred and $35,000,000 Time: 03:00 - 03:43 per year, minus driver Time: 03:43 - 03:44 I know that sounds like a lot, but in the race to win, it means that every decision needs to get the best bang for the buck. The amount of engineering that goes into building these cars is next level. We're using many of the same techniques, many of the same technologies that, you you know, NASA or SpaceX would use to design their rockets. We apply them to designing our own rocket that goes around the racetrack. So this is the public Time: 03:45 - 04:06 display room. Now we're going into the secret what do we call this room? The warehouse. Time: 04:06 - 04:10 The warehouse. Time: 04:11 - 04:11 Woah. Yeah. This feels cooler. Time: 04:13 - 04:15 Who are these cars? So these are variety of different cars from throughout history. Time: 04:21 - 04:26 There's some show cars, Time: 04:27 - 04:29 but also some race cars. Oh my god. This is so cool. Time: 04:29 - 04:32 Can I walk here? Time: 04:35 - 04:36 I have a question. You're gonna say no. Can I sit right there? Yes. He didn't say no. Just be really careful not to nail your head on the banister above as you get up. Time: 04:38 - 04:48 Welcome to my crib. Time: 04:49 - 04:50 Perfect. Every formula one team's goal is to create the two fastest cars possible within the rules so their two drivers can beat the other teams around different shaped tracks all around the world, racking up points to win the constructors Time: 04:52 - 05:04 championship. And for the last two years, the team that has done that is Red Bull by a lot. Here are the winners of every race last year, and here's Red Bull. Time: 05:04 - 05:13 Yeah. Time: 05:13 - 05:14 So how do they do it? What makes a winning formula one car? Time: 05:14 - 05:18 This is the car that won all of those races, and this is one of the aerodynamicists Time: 05:20 - 05:24 who helped design it. So this is RB 19. This is last year's car that obviously was incredibly successful and we're all very proud of. A winning formula one car needs to do two things, make super quick turns and go extremely fast in a straight line. The challenge is that the things that make a car very good at one make it harder to be great at the other. The team that can design the car that does both the best takes home the trophy. Let me explain. First, to make a quick turn, you need a strong grip on the ground. Going back to pure fundamentals, what we want to do is generate what's called downforce. More downforce means stronger grip, which means quicker turns. So how do you create more force down? Think of a formula one car like an airplane upside side down. On a plane, the air moving across the wings lifts it up. But here, the air across the car forces it down. So that is where the air literally sucks the car into the ground. To get it to suck, you need higher pressure above the car and lower pressure below. And one way to get lower pressure air is to get it moving really fast. Low pressure is effectively high velocity air. So you want to be able to speed up the air as much as you possibly can under the floor and effectively slow it down as much as you can on on top of the floor. Here's the part I think is really cool. A good way to get fast lower pressure air isn't for it to just shoot under the car in a straight line. It's to create tiny tornadoes Time: 05:25 - 06:34 under the car. They don't say tiny tornado, though. They say vortex. A highly powerful vortex. That in itself generates a lot of low pressure because it's it's a structure that that Time: 06:35 - 06:44 rotates. High velocity air. Those structures then run down the the length of the floor, and they generate low pressure for a very long region. So they have all these tiny tornadoes that help suck the car toward the ground to give it better grip to make faster turns. At top speed, a formula one car generates a down force three or four times the weight of the car, meaning this car could theoretically drive on the ceiling. But all of this down force comes at a cost. To go super fast in a straight line, you need to knife through the air with as little drag as possible. But as you create more downforce It normally comes with added drag, which is preventing the car moving through the air. So it's a resistive force. For example, look at this back wing. It generates downforce on the turns, but it feels like a big parachute slowing the car down in a straight line, which is why formula one teams are allowed to build in a control that the driver can press to flip part of that wing down, allowing the car to zoom down the straights even faster. This is called the drag reduction system or DRS. Designing a winning formula one car means balancing all of these different effects, pushing the rules and the limits of physics to get a little more grip and a little more speed. This is a question that I'm sure you're gonna say no to. Is there any chance in hell that I can sit in this car? Time: 06:45 - 07:53 I don't think that's up to me, but Time: 07:54 - 07:56 Jack? Time: 07:56 - 07:57 You can sit in the car. Time: 07:58 - 07:59 Yeah. Thank you. Time: 08:01 - 08:02 I've got something rather special that you can wear while you're in the park. Pop that on. We'll get you in the car. See how you look being a Formula one driver. Time: 08:02 - 08:10 So how are you feeling in that, Claire? This is so cool. Let me just describe what this feels like. My legs are above my butt. So I'm sitting like that. My legs are like that, and my back is here like that. So I feel sort of Time: 08:11 - 08:25 vulnerable. My entire field of view is what's happening in here. I'm getting more and more claustrophobic as I talk to you, which is interesting. The idea of going 200 miles an hour in this car is Time: 08:25 - 08:36 terrifying and I can't believe people do it. Time: 08:37 - 08:39 I have a totally new appreciation for what this feels like. The butt, I have to admit, is quite comfortable. This is clearly Time: 08:43 - 08:49 crafted for someone's Time: 08:49 - 08:51 butt, Max Verstappen's butt, apparently. Time: 08:51 - 08:53 That is actually gonna come up in my conversation with Max Verstappen, but more on that in a minute. Eventually, I had to get out of my dream car because now that we've learned the design goals of a formula one car, it's time to see how they actually make Time: 08:54 - 09:06 it. As every team works on designing their cars, they're constantly testing those designs in computer simulations, Time: 09:08 - 09:14 in physical rigs that mimic a moving car, and in big wind tunnels. One of my favorite details is because Formula one limits how much teams are allowed to test full size cars in a wind tunnel, they build these little 60% scale versions of their cars and test those. One reason that Formula one cars are so light and fast and strong is that basically every part of the car that you can see is made of a material 10 times stronger than steel, but half the weight, carbon fiber. Would it be good if I had a piece? Yeah. Do you have a piece of carbon fiber? Woah. Cool. I admit, this is quite a substantial Time: 09:14 - 09:45 block. Can I hold it? How heavy is this? Oh, it's heavier than I thought. You can see the structure Time: 09:46 - 09:50 if you look on the side. So that's when it's layered up. Why is this material used so often throughout the car? With its strength to weight ratio being so good, it means that you can make it extremely light whilst it retaining a lot of structure and a lot of strength. So if you hold it up, you can actually see light through it there. So it does have a sort of fabric quality to it. Woven carbon. To create the carbon fiber parts that they need, teams manufacture patterns in the right shapes and then lay down carbon fiber cloth, sometimes in a hundred layers. Time: 09:51 - 10:18 Then they suck all the air out and shove them into basically a pressure Time: 10:19 - 10:22 a pressure cooker to squeeze the layers together with Time: 10:23 - 10:26 resin. Then they cut and measure those carbon fiber pieces and other metal parts with huge programmable machines. It looks like it's getting a milk bath. The whiteness is down to the additive that gets added to the water to make sure it doesn't rust the machine. I don't know if you can fully appreciate how big this is, but there are dozens of these boxes just in this massive room in front of us. All of the parts for the RB 20, the new Red Bull car, are being manufactured Time: 10:26 - 10:52 in this room right now in these white boxes. Time: 10:52 - 10:55 Pretty cool. Any chance I can I can look in? I can imagine so. Yes. I think it's more about not getting it on camera. For the metal parts of the car, which kind of metal they use depends on what they need it to do. Okay. So this is aluminum I love it. Or aluminum as he's calling it. So this is a lot of what the car is made out of. We use aluminum throughout the the build of the car for certain parts and components Time: 10:56 - 11:17 Okay. Which is generally light, very strong. You wanna try that one? It is quite Time: 11:17 - 11:21 Oh, look how. Time: 11:23 - 11:24 It's hard to show visually how different these objects are, except maybe Time: 11:24 - 11:28 how how much I'm trying to hold. I could probably do 20. Time: 11:29 - 11:33 Reps like this until my arm fell off. Like, this is very heavy. So that's gensmet, which is an alloy which we use to add weight to the car. We sometimes add weight into the car when the driver isn't up to weight, so we have to have a minimum weight of the car. Yeah. So we'll use tiny strips of this throughout the car to bring the car up to weight. There are thousands of pieces that make up a formula one car. And after they're designed and molded and machined, Time: 11:34 - 11:57 some of them need to get painted. Time: 11:57 - 11:59 The paint job on a formula one car is a big deal to fans, especially the moment that it's released and they see the car for the first time, and teams spend a lot of effort to design something that's gonna look beautiful. But the paint isn't just to be pretty. It's gotta go fast. For example, a lot of the sponsor logos that you'll see on these cars aren't stickers because even that tiny little edge would create unwanted drag. They paint the logos on. Watching these cars get built, it's just astonishing to me how much detail and design and effort goes into the finished car that we see on track. Time: 12:02 - 12:31 Now we're headed to the most secret room yet, where this team is building their new engine. This is Time: 12:34 - 12:38 one of the world's most advanced engine development facilities. This isn't just an engine. This is a Formula One engine. Right now, Red Bull buys engines for their cars from Honda, but that's about to change. In 2026, Red Bull's cars will use their own custom engines that they're working on right now, and we're about to be one of the first to go see it. So this building here wasn't here. Two year two two years ago in June was our first engine. And when you see the workshop, you'll see what we've been doing. It's, Time: 12:39 - 13:03 pretty impressive. Why does it matter to build a formula one engine yourself? Control and the time between the chassis and the engine is is paramount, really. You know, you have a better working together, your aerodynamics, and and everything, all that side of it is is the way to win. This team's big bet is if they invest a ton of money and time into a custom engine, they can eek a little bit more speed and control out of their car, and ultimately win more races. Can you hear me? Okay. Time: 13:04 - 13:28 So what's happening right now is I'm in the super secret engine room, but we can't actually show anything close to the new engine. But I'm standing in front of the real formula one engines. I just can't show them to you. People are gonna love it. They're gonna hate me. Okay. So this is the engine that I can show you. We can show you. Time: 13:29 - 13:46 And the reason why little bits are covered up is that those are the secret parts that you're not allowed to see. If I'm working on a Formula One team working on an engine, what is the goal? Is it maximum power, smallest size? Is it light? Power. You want as much power as possible because the driver will ask for more power. Even if he's got the most powerful engine, he will want more. To understand why this engine is so cool, let me explain how the engine in your car works and how it compares. Okay. So your car probably has a four stroke internal combustion engine, and a formula one car does too, which means there's a cylinder, and inside there's a piston that goes down, up, down, up in four strokes. In the first one, air and fuel rush into the chamber, then they get compressed and the pressure builds. Then a spark ignites the mix and it explodes, Time: 13:47 - 14:28 shoving the piston down and turning a set of gears, generating a mechanical movement that turns the wheels of the car. Then the piston lifts back up and pushes the remaining gas out. That whole process happens inside one cylinder, and there are six of them in a v shape, which is why it's called a v six engine. Your car might have anywhere from four to eight depending on what you drive. But one big difference between your car and a formula one car is the maximum number of cycles that down up down up each engine can complete per minute. Your car? About 6,000. Time: 14:29 - 14:56 A formula one car? Over 15,000. Time: 14:56 - 14:58 That contributes to more power to go faster. Plus, these cars combine a bunch of other technologies Time: 14:58 - 15:03 to get a little bit more oomph, like a turbocharger, which compresses air before it enters the cylinder. So it packs more punch when it's then lit on fire, and a motor and battery system that repurposes energy from the brakes and exhaust. The whole thing altogether is the powertrain of a modern formula one car. It's a great example of why formula one cars actually matter for people like you and me. It's not that this tech is brand new. It's that it's combined and tweaked and perfected by hundreds of smart people with millions of dollars to make it better. And those changes help inspire better car tech for all of us. The engines that they're building here are based on rules for 2026, Time: 15:04 - 15:39 which will use less fuel and more electricity, and therefore make a slightly different sound. And we got a sneak peek. Can you hear that? So that's the new engine running? Correct. Yeah. Are you allowed to You're allowed to hear it. You're not allowed to see. Time: 15:39 - 15:54 Just running by oh. Time: 15:55 - 15:56 What did that noise change mean? So it it really just revved up the the speed, basically. And it's now going into this automated power curve. You can hear it's coming down in speed. So with every single speed, we take a measurement. Time: 15:57 - 16:09 Next speed, measurement. Next speed, measurement. So they're testing it at different speeds, at different they're running power curves to see how it performs. Time: 16:10 - 16:17 And at that time, Time: 16:17 - 16:18 always wide open throttle, which means everything we have. Right? Now that we've seen how they build these cars, it's time to see where they race them. And that means that we need to go to Bahrain. Time: 16:19 - 16:30 We're here. Time: 16:36 - 16:37 Here we go. Time: 16:38 - 16:39 Hi. Time: 16:41 - 16:42 No. I'm I am not allowed to video any of this. If someone wanna wait till a couple of kilometers away. Does this ever get old? Twenty years in? No. So Every day is a learning day. Every day is different. Time: 16:44 - 16:55 I can't believe I'm here. This is the new car, the r b 20. Time: 16:56 - 17:00 And, Time: 17:07 - 17:08 you might recognize these guys. Time: 17:08 - 17:10 Their job is to take the incredible cars that hundreds of people just built and speed them up over 200 miles an hour, facing forces sometimes greater than five times normal gravity, fighting off competitors to bring their team over the finish line first. These drivers are legends. Max Verstappen has been dominating Formula one recently. Time: 17:12 - 17:30 Remember those Red Bull win records? Here's just Max's wins. Yeah. What does it feel like to drive a Formula one car? Imagine sitting in a roller coaster and it basically just shoots off, Time: 17:33 - 17:44 but then, like, five to 10 times worse while having a steering wheel in your hands with all the buttons. Back in the day when my dad was in a fun one as a little baby, basically, I sat in it and, you know, it's very cute, the pictures. But the very first time that I sat in the car and I was gonna drive it myself, I was a little bit nervous. Even I, to this day, sometimes when I do that, I get this, like, it shoots off. You have this, like, like, Time: 17:45 - 18:07 kind of feeling. Yeah. I still have that in an Avanca sometimes. Time: 18:08 - 18:11 And for these cars, since no two drivers are the same, no two formula one cars are quite the same either, even for the same team. They have, like, a whole book of Time: 18:14 - 18:22 measurements, Time: 18:22 - 18:23 for myself, for Max. So they know exactly my seat position, my pedal position, my sitting position. The seat is very important. It's a carbon seat. You're naturally in a very unnatural position. I actually got to sit in what I think was your seat in the RB 19 in the factory. It's probably a bit wide. Actually, it was kind of a good fit. Time: 18:23 - 18:41 Did I just tell world champion Max Verstappen that our butts are the same size? Time: 18:42 - 18:46 Anyway, here's what their steering wheel looks like, and here's one of the engineers who helped design it. Would a steering wheel for each of the different teams look totally different? Yeah. So they all look very different. On every team's custom wheel, there are dozens of buttons and knobs and switches all meant to optimize the engine and the tires and the brakes and much more in every possible scenario, all while the driver is driving. The drivers memorize Time: 18:46 - 19:07 all the buttons so they can do it without actually looking at the wheel. Sorry. Time: 19:08 - 19:11 Oh, we're good. Time: 19:14 - 19:15 He might have to go do a pit stop. If I run At any moment. There's a pit stop. Time: 19:15 - 19:19 That was a pit stop. At least once every race. Every car needs to exit the track and enter their pit box, where roughly 22 members of the pit crew swarm the car to quickly change the tires and other parts. A good pit stop is less than two seconds. They give out a trophy for fastest pit stop, and when we were at the Red Bull factory, we got to see theirs. Time: 19:22 - 19:40 These tires just came off the car, and they Time: 19:42 - 19:45 are hot, hot. Like Time: 19:45 - 19:47 Hold on. Time: 19:49 - 19:49 Now it hurts. Time: 19:50 - 19:51 That's so hot. I got to try stacking these tires, and Time: 19:52 - 19:55 listen, they've got a really hard job. Couple more tires. It didn't stop. The tire options are the same for each team. For each race, they all get a hard, medium, and soft option. Or if it's raining, two different types of wet tires. Your soft tires have the most grip, but they wear out the fastest, and your hard ones are on the opposite end of that spectrum, and medium is medium. When they say my tires are done, what do they mean? The drivers will feel when when the grip is is going off. Choosing the right tires at the right time is a big part of a team's race strategy. Time: 19:55 - 20:22 During a race, you'll hear drivers talking to only one person, their race engineer. But that race engineer is also talking to a massive team of strategists, Time: 20:24 - 20:32 all trying to figure out the best way to win. Some of those strategists are at the track, but most of them are actually back at the factory in a big room like this. It looks like NASA. And the people in this room aren't just thinking up plans, they're using supercomputers to run simulations Time: 20:32 - 20:47 about tons of possible outcomes. It's millions even over the course of a race, and we run them on the Oracle Cloud. So Millions? Millions. Yeah. Those simulations are taking into account weather and heat of the brakes and tire performance and everything every other driver is doing, and then feeding those simulations back to the track. Their aim is always to try and win a race. So that's kind of thinking about what's the best thing for you to do, but also what might your competitors do, and so how might you need to therefore react to that. This is all real time? Yes. Exactly. So we're constantly talking. The intercom on the pit wall is constantly lighting up. There's always Time: 20:47 - 21:22 somebody in one of your ears. So actually, the headphones have dual, so you can hear one car in one ear and the other car in the other ear. So you're always hearing multiple conversations trying to take them all in. It's basically like playing a board game. That's how I always think of it. The most complicated board game in your eyes. Time: 21:22 - 21:37 A winning formula one car isn't just about the tech inside that car. It's also about the tech behind every move that the car makes every lap of the race. But the thing I think is so cool is that even with all of those strategists and supercomputers and simulations, Time: 21:38 - 21:52 at the end of the day, it still comes down to human skill. It's hard sometimes to focus, you know, because you have always someone on your ear asking you questions, and you are just trying to focus as much as possible. But you have to have that capacity, you know. Everything that we've talked about, from design to build to paint to simulation to test, it's not just happening once. A Formula one car is never done. A team is constantly learning and changing and rebuilding between every single race Time: 21:52 - 22:19 over and over and over again. In the end, one of the things that strikes me most about Formula one and Formula one cars is that they're so much like a Lego set. It really has to be all of the individual perfectly formed pieces coming together to make a whole thing. This is a theme I've noticed with a lot of my episodes of Huge If True. Technology has always been a story of human ingenuity. Time: 22:20 - 22:40 But more and more, it's also the story of human collaboration. And I think that's really the story of a formula one car and the story of so much of the technology that we all enjoy. I think there's something really magical about a team of engineers and designers and strategists and athletes and all of these people coming together to build something that gets better and better and better every single time. I find a lot of hope in that. If we can build cars like these, Time: 22:40 - 23:05 what else can we do? Time: 23:07 - 23:08 I can't believe this is real life. One of the things that I've been keeping in mind is that most of the people that work on these cars won't actually get to go see a race, at least not with their team because there's a limited number of people that Formula One allows each team to bring to each race. And I know the only reason that I get to do this is because you watch and subscribe to this show. And I just I'm feeling really grateful. Time: 23:16 - 23:36 I hope that these kinds of stories Time: 23:37 - 23:38 make you a little bit more optimistic about what we can build while we work together. So if you're enjoying this video and you wanna help us go to more incredible places, subscribe and tell me in the comments where we should go. And we have some wild episodes coming up. I can't wait to show you. Time: 23:39 - 23:50I follow Formula 1 for almost 20 years. This is one of the most complete, easy to understand and in depth video I've ever seen. A truly amazing video, Cleo, thank you!",

      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:21 too good. Like swimsuits that make a swimmer's body too streamlined, or gloves that make a receiver's hands too grippy, or bats that let a player Time: 00:21 - 00:29 hit the ball too hard or shoes that make a runner too freaking Time: 00:29 - 00:33 fast. They call it tech doping, using physical gear to gain an unfair advantage. In this video, I'm gonna show you the band technology that you won't see in the Olympics. Oh, woah. Woah. That's grippy. Time: 00:33 - 00:44 And the cutting edge tech that you will see that's on the very edge of what's allowed. You might be thinking, hold on. No gear should give athletes an advantage, Time: 00:45 - 00:53 but we don't run barefoot anymore. We don't swim naked. We use tech to play sports, and that tech keeps getting better, pushing forward what humans can do. So where's the line? That's what I really wanna figure out. This debate is about way more than sports. In every part of our lives, technology pushes humans forward, and it's up to us to decide what do we want from it. This video is about that question. Let me show you the cutting edge of sports technology. Time: 00:54 - 01:18 I am wearing the fastest suit in the world, and that's a fact. The fastest suits in the world. Technological Time: 01:18 - 01:23 doping. It is cheating. A weekend that changed distance running forever. The nighties controversial Time: 01:24 - 01:29 Vaporfly shoot. Fueling new controversy over the suits the swimmers are wearing. Surpassing human capabilities. Time: 01:29 - 01:35 Today, I'm at Nike's test lab in Oregon to show you some of the world's best and most controversial sports equipment. But first, if you were trying to decide whether to ban something from sports, how would you do it? Here's where to start. First, most regulators ask, is it dangerous? To athletes or fans or both? This is the big reason they give for banning steroids, but it applies to hardware too. For example, in Major League Baseball, they're not allowed to use aluminum bats. They have to use wooden ones because aluminum would allow them to hit the ball so fast they might kill people on the field or hurt people in the stands. So if gear greatly increases the risk of injury, it might not be allowed. But most of the cool tech that we're talking about doesn't increase danger. It just makes athletes better. So the next question they ask is, is it against the spirit of the sport? But Time: 01:46 - 02:30 how do you define that exactly? Spirit of the sport, it's intentionally Time: 02:30 - 02:34 vague. So it gets broken up into smaller questions. Like, can everyone use this tech? Is it fair to record holders? Does it artificially enhance a player's performance? Time: 02:34 - 02:43 Let me give you some examples. Time: 02:43 - 02:44 Try to decide what you think is right before I tell you what the rule makers chose. Time: 02:44 - 02:48 This is the Olympics in 1972. Time: 02:50 - 02:52 Do you notice anything missing? Nobody's wearing goggles. Four years later, the Olympics allowed them. You see early adopters start to use them, and those athletes start winning. Here's a chart showing swimming records by year. Time: 02:52 - 03:03 That's when goggles were allowed. Most people today would say allowing goggles was a good idea, But then, something new caused another big spike. Time: 03:03 - 03:10 In 02/2008, Time: 03:13 - 03:14 Speedo collaborated with NASA to make this, the Laser Racer. This suit was so cool. The fabric mimicked shark skin with these little channels that let water flow more easily. It had these panels that sucked swimmers bodies into a more streamlined position. And people speculated that the way it trapped air made swimmers float more easily, which Speedo denied. But it was clear this new tech was helping swimmers Time: 03:14 - 03:37 crush world records. Athletes were doing things nobody thought was possible. It was awesome. You remember that Olympics when Michael Phelps won more gold medals than any human had ever won in a single Olympics ever? He was wearing a laser racer. Time: 03:37 - 03:49 Is that fair? Time: 03:50 - 03:51 This new suit made the swimming world lose their minds. The general manager of the US team said the records shouldn't count. So should this fancy super swimsuit be allowed? Within a year, the swimming governing body voted to ban them. Time: 03:52 - 04:05 The swimmers you see at the Olympics now are wearing suits made with only textile fabrics that can only cover this much of their body. I feel mixed about that. We can't see well underwater and our skin isn't textured like Time: 04:05 - 04:16 sharks. Time: 04:17 - 04:17 But goggles are allowed and these swimsuits aren't. But on the other hand, we don't allow flippers. Time: 04:18 - 04:23 There's a line somewhere. It's just not always obvious. Like prescription lenses in Olympic shooting. Okay or not okay? If you said okay, the regulators agree with you. Olympic shooters are allowed to wear prescription lenses. They can correct their vision. They just can't enhance it. Or how about this? Sticky glue that makes it easier to catch a football. Okay or not okay? The NFL said not okay, but grippy gloves Time: 04:23 - 04:48 are fine. Out of the pool. Oh my goodness. Time: 04:49 - 04:52 I love these questions because they get at what we think the whole point is of both sports and technology. And of course, it's so messy. Time: 04:52 - 05:00 But the messiest of all is the debate about running shoes and a record that was supposed to be impossible to beat. He has Time: 05:01 - 05:08 done Time: 05:09 - 05:09 it. Welcome to Nike's Test Lab. Time: 05:14 - 05:16 I'm at Nike to answer a question I've been wondering for years. Let me explain. In 2019, Time: 05:19 - 05:24 I watched Eliud Kipchoge become the first person ever to run a marathon in under two hours. That is four minutes and thirty five seconds per mile for 26.2 Time: 05:24 - 05:36 miles. Here's what that speed looks like for most people. Time: 05:36 - 05:39 This was supposed to be impossible, but he did it. And while the world celebrated Kipchoge's record in professional running, all eyes turned to these. Time: 05:44 - 05:53 He was wearing special prototype shoes built to make him run faster. In fact, studies showed that this design helped runners at the time go two to 3% faster than the next fastest shoe. And regulators started saying that this shoe threatened the integrity of the sport. But Time: 05:53 - 06:08 why this shoe? If you look back at the history of running shoes, you'll see that over the last hundred years, they've gotten a lot better than two to 3%. Early running shoes looked like this. They're basically loafers with spikes. People can run a lot faster in basically any running shoe today. So why was this shoe all of a sudden so controversial? Let me show you the answer. This is the newest version of that same shoe design, and I'm about to cut it open. So this is the Time: 06:08 - 06:34 successor of what Eliud Kipchoge Time: 06:35 - 06:37 beat the two hour marathon in. Yeah. Awesome. It's a culmination of all kinds of technological development. It's a thing of beauty, and we're going to destroy it. There's no chance I can put it through, is there? You could guide me. If I lose a finger, it's my fault. Time: 06:37 - 06:49 Lindsay, what do you think? Well, we do have her on camera saying it will be her fault. If I cut my finger off, I'm saying it to camera. It's not like his fault. Excuse me, Jesus. Time: 06:50 - 06:58 No. This is fine. Come on. It's fine. It'll it'll be fine. Yeah. It's gonna be great. Time: 06:59 - 07:02 Look at this. Time: 07:22 - 07:23 Lots of companies now make their own version of a super shoe, and people say they've changed running sports forever. But how exactly? At a high level, every super shoe today has three key sections. The upper, which holds your foot, the outsole, which hits the ground, and the midsole, which mostly determines how much of the energy that a runner exerts down into the ground is returned to boost them into their next stride. This is called energy return, and it's a huge deal in running. Nike's new super shoes specifically maximized energy return by building in a way taller stack of new cushy foam and a carbon fiber plate that acts like a lever springing the runner forward, which outside the shoe looks like this right here. Time: 07:27 - 08:06 They even included special air pockets for extra bounce. Before super shoes, a good energy return rate was about 60 to 65%. Time: 08:06 - 08:14 Now it's more like 80%, Time: 08:14 - 08:15 way more of the runner's energy that they get to reuse. I wanted to show you what that energy return feels like. But to do it, Nike didn't just give me their shoes. They let me try the real team USA Olympic uniforms. Time: 08:16 - 08:27 So I'm wearing Time: 08:27 - 08:28 this and Time: 08:28 - 08:29 this and Time: 08:32 - 08:33 this and most importantly, Time: 08:33 - 08:35 these. Time: 08:35 - 08:36 Okay. Now go away. Time: 08:36 - 08:38 I feel Time: 08:43 - 08:44 awesome. Time: 08:44 - 08:45 Let's do this. Time: 08:45 - 08:46 They didn't just test the shoe. They tested me. They analyzed my running style. They showed me how these uniforms deal with sweat. And hardest of all, they made me run-in 95 degree heat at 70% Time: 08:48 - 08:58 humidity. Some of your cameras might not work super well in here because they might fog up. What speed would you like to run at today? Time: 08:58 - 09:05 I'd like to go fast enough to give you some real information. I'll just be right outside the window. So I'll look at you. Thumbs up means I can go a little bit faster. Thumbs down means a little bit slower. Okay. Put me in, coach. Yeah. I did not fully understand what I was in for. Time: 09:05 - 09:20 I don't know how to do that. Time: 09:21 - 09:22 You want to go as fast as you'll let her go? I could feel the energy return. It feels like a trampoline on my feet. Time: 09:26 - 09:32 When super shoes were introduced, just like the swimmers with the laser racer, runners began to crush world records. Marathon times saw the biggest increase in fifty years. People started complaining that the shoes were giving runners energy, but that's not how energy return works. All the energy has to come from the runner, and anyone who runs knows Time: 09:36 - 09:55 it's not easy. I'm reaching a point where I can't talk casually anymore. She's getting hot. She's been running for Time: 09:56 - 10:02 two and a half minutes. World's best marathoners can run-in this temperature at faster speeds than this for two plus hours. Time: 10:02 - 10:09 You're up for it. We'll have you go for about six more minutes. Time: 10:11 - 10:14 How you feel? Good job. Time: 10:16 - 10:17 So fun. Right? Time: 10:18 - 10:19 That's great. You got good sweat going all over the place. Beating up over here. Time: 10:20 - 10:24 Terrific. Time: 10:24 - 10:25 Look at this. Time: 10:26 - 10:26 So running shoes that make you faster. Okay or not okay? Regulators decided something in the middle. They tried to restrict how much energy return super shoes could give by implementing a 40 millimeter foam height limit and saying shoes can't have more than one carbon fiber plate. Kipchoge's shoes barely fit these requirements, Time: 10:28 - 10:47 but they were prototypes, which felt unfair. So regulators added a rule saying that all shoes had to be available for anyone to buy at least four months before they were used in competition. These rules were pretty much aimed at Nike. And back then, Nike wasn't happy about it. They issued a statement saying the rules would stifle innovation. So I asked the head of Nike's sport research lab about it now. Why did Nike feel that way at the time, and do you still feel that way now? There was a number of reasons we were pushing back and and worrying about stifling innovation. I think it's like just a moral obligation to keep to keep pushing forward. Our goal is not to make the world's fastest athletes Time: 10:47 - 11:22 faster by putting fans behind them and pushing them down the field. It's that's not interesting to us. That's really the key. It's all about pushing the human body forward. Time: 11:22 - 11:31 But that brings us to the last big debate about technology in sports. Time: 11:32 - 11:36 What if the tech that you're debating Time: 11:36 - 11:38 is part of someone's body? Time: 11:39 - 11:41 You might remember this guy, Oscar Pistorius. He was the first person to qualify and compete in the Olympics with these, running blades. This was a moment that got a lot of people talking about what's fair and what's not in sports. You might not know him yet, but that's Blake Lieber. He qualified for the Olympics eight years after Pistorius, but he wasn't allowed to compete. I had, what, the the fifth fastest time in the world against able-bodied athletes, which qualified me for the Olympic games. And then I was abruptly stopped. Time: 11:43 - 12:11 I had to take my my case to the court of arbitration of sport. The Olympics had allowed Pistorius, but they now wanted to revisit the rules. Should running blades be allowed? If you let people wear glasses for shooting, meaning they can correct a disability that they have, aren't prosthetics the same? And how do you decide what's a correction and what's an enhancement? Time: 12:11 - 12:29 Turns out, Time: 12:30 - 12:30 tests. A lot of tests. But dots on my blades to see the spring compression to see, like, what type of energy return are we getting out of the prosthetic legs and how does that compare to somebody who have their legs. Researchers found that Blake's prosthetic legs made him no faster at sprinting or gave him better endurance, but they did make him worse at accelerating and rounding curves. Then the opponent side argued that prosthetics are lighter and they don't require any of the body's oxygen. It was seeming like a toss-up. But then But the one thing that they got me on specifically Time: 12:31 - 13:01 was called the MASH rule max allowable standing height. The Olympics didn't use this rule for Pistorius, but now they decided Blake couldn't compete because his blades made him taller than he would be naturally. But Blake was born without the bottom part of his legs. He has never had a full height naturally with his legs. They calculated it using measurements from other parts of his body to tell him what his height would theoretically Time: 13:01 - 13:26 have been. And to make matters worse, those calculations were based on only small studies of white and Asian men. But the whole idea of using averages for athletes is tricky. Most people's wingspan is roughly their height, but Michael Phelps' wingspan is three whole inches taller than he is. That's part of what makes him so great. But in the end And they said this is the rules they said. We're sorry, Blake, but you have to drop your your legs by six inches. And changing your height is not the same as changing your swimsuit. I trained at six two my whole life. Time: 13:27 - 13:57 And now I'm five nine, so I'll go reach or I'll go run or my my back went out. And the question that the million dollar question Time: 13:58 - 14:05 is what's fair and what's not fair? If somebody was born with bad vision and they wear glasses, Time: 14:05 - 14:11 you wouldn't regulate that. Now I could try to wear glasses, but I don't I don't need glasses. Really, the conversation that we're talking about is a fear or a concern Time: 14:12 - 14:20 that technology will get so good, people at Onblades Time: 14:20 - 14:24 will actually outperform everybody. Time: 14:24 - 14:27 Is that what people are really talking? I think I think yeah. I mean, I think that's the conversation that that that that is really at hand. It wasn't me trying to compete. It was the idea of the Pandora's box Time: 14:27 - 14:38 that it could potentially open up. I don't agree with it, but I understand. Time: 14:39 - 14:42 We have come so far in improving what humans can do. Today, we have better nutrition and training and strategy and recovery and, of course, Time: 14:43 - 14:51 technology. The whole point of technology Time: 14:52 - 14:54 is to make people better. To make our lives easier, to make us more capable, to make things that we never thought were possible come true. But how far and Time: 14:55 - 15:03 how fast and exactly in what direction technology pushes Time: 15:04 - 15:07 us is the big debate that we're gonna keep on having far beyond sports. Should we regulate it? Should we tame it down? Should we allow it? Should we integrate it? I think it's wrong to stop. I think it's you can say it's unethical to introduce these things to to sport. It's unethical to stop inventing and to stop pushing Time: 15:07 - 15:24 human potential forward. And personally, I can't wait to see what humans are capable of. Time: 15:25 - 15:30 Welcome to Nike's test lab. Time: 15:34 - 15:36 That's Time: 15:38 - 15:39 gonna be the ending. Time: 15:42 - 15:43I bought a pair of shoes from a drug dealer once, I don't know what he laced them with but I was tripping for days.",

It's this huge tunnel, over 100 meters underground and 27 kilometers long, running under nearby homes and businesses and farms. And inside that tunnel, scientists put a long blue tube big enough to crawl through. And inside that tube they put two pipes that they keep colder and emptier than outer space. And down those pipes, they fire particles smaller than atoms in opposite directions, pushing them faster and faster and faster, faster until when they're almost at the speed of light, they smash together, sending subatomic debris flying off into this massive detector. This underground particle smasher took thousands of people from over a hundred different countries dollars 5,000,000,000",

Why spend so much money and time to smash particles is Time: 00:50 - 00:55 build a bigger one? Future circular collider. Mean particle accelerator. Building a bigger one. In Geneva, Switzerland. In more than three times its size. And twice as deep. I'm going all the way to Switzerland. To the particle smasher itself. Time: 01:01 - 01:10 And Time: 01:10 - 01:11 This is huge if true. Part of this video is sponsored by Shopify. Time: 01:26 - 01:30 Minus one, please. Yeah. I'm in an elevator on my way down to the giant particle smasher, more scientifically known as the Large Hadron Collider or LHC. It's inside the biggest and most famous physics lab in the world, CERN. I can't believe I'm here. Getting to visit here is a really big deal. Thousands of scientists from all around the world gather here to do cutting edge research about how the universe works. Time: 01:32 - 01:53 Alright. We're gonna tunnel now. Time: 01:56 - 01:57 Beyond that yellow door is one of the places where particles actually collide, specifically this one, the ATLAS detector. Time: 01:58 - 02:05 Oh my Time: 02:12 - 02:13 god. Time: 02:14 - 02:15 It's beautiful. Time: 02:15 - 02:16 This thing is huge. To give you a sense of scale, just look at it compared to a person. Look how small they are. Those are people compared to this enormous machine. How did you put this in here? So we can see from down here Time: 02:23 - 02:36 that there is a a shaft above us. If if people have the hobby to build a ship in a bottle, Time: 02:37 - 02:42 it's exactly the same way of constructing. You have to lower it in and then construct it in place. Time: 02:43 - 02:48 I'm so amazed Time: 02:49 - 02:50 that people built this. This giant underground detector is where those particles finally collide after being sped up close to the speed of light around that 27 kilometer track. Where does the collision happen? So the collision happens over here. So the detector is symmetrical Time: 02:50 - 03:04 around the collision point, and so we're at one end of it. The detector is big, but the actual collider part is very small. What you can see in the center is the Large Hadron Collider. So you can really see how tiny the beam pipe is. Time: 03:04 - 03:17 Each pipe is about the size of your two hands like this, or about the diameter of an orange, with thousands of magnets running along it that force the particles within that pipe into a space the width of a human hair. I just accidentally pulled out one of my hairs in in order to demonstrate this. Can you see this hair? Okay. Can you see this hair compared to the scale that we're talking about right now? That's the size of the space the particles are moving through. But even a human hair is enormous Time: 03:17 - 03:41 compared to the particles themselves. You already know that atoms and the particles inside of them are very small, but they are so much tinier than most people think. Look at a single strand of your hair. Now imagine that single hair is as big across as the entire Earth is wide. Now zoom in. The size of a single cell inside of that hair would be like the distance from Paris to Rome. Now zoom in again. A protein inside that cell would be like six soccer fields across. Time: 03:42 - 04:09 An atom inside that protein would be like one school bus across. Time: 04:09 - 04:13 The nucleus at the center of that atom would be like the width of a grain of rice. And the protons within that nucleus, they'd be like grains of salt. So a proton compared to the width of your hair is like a grain of salt compared to the entire Earth. Time: 04:14 - 04:31 And that is what scientists are sending flying around inside of this machine. Time: 04:31 - 04:36 Protons, which are being squeezed by magnets into a space the width of a hair. It is incredible that we can do this. As humans, we experience only a tiny slice Time: 04:36 - 04:46 of the full scale of reality. Time: 04:46 - 04:48 But there's so much more. Wait, but hang on. If they're sending these tiny little protons down a tunnel 27 kilometers long, how do they get them to actually Time: 04:49 - 04:58 hit each other? Just think about shooting grains of salt at each other from really really really far away. Seriously, think about it. How would you do that? If you just thought fire tons of salt, that's exactly what they do. They don't just fire a hundred or a thousand protons at each other. They fire a hundred billion in bunches in each direction. And when they do that, a hundred billion versus a hundred billion. Time: 04:58 - 05:20 Guess how many actually collide? On average, we get about 50 or 60 collisions per crossing. Time: 05:21 - 05:27 You heard that right. 60. Six zero will actually collide, Which is why they'll do the whole thing over and over and over again. 30,000,000 Time: 05:28 - 05:36 times per second. There's approximately 3,000 bunches each with over a hundred billion protons creating 1,000,000,000 Time: 05:37 - 05:43 collisions Time: 05:43 - 05:43 per second inside of this massive Time: 05:44 - 05:46 machine. Okay, so we have thousands of scientists spending billions of dollars to smash billions of protons in an underground tunnel. Time: 05:49 - 05:56 But why? Time: 05:56 - 05:57 Why do all of this in the first place? Well, if you look on the internet, you'll see that there are a lot Time: 05:58 - 06:03 of theories. From ending the world to creating black holes to it already ended the world and we're living inside a black hole to paranormal activity to new dimensions to hooded figures performing rituals to summon the devil. That last one was a prank, by the way. No. We are not doing any of that. The truth about what is happening here is both Time: 06:03 - 06:23 much harder to explain Time: 06:23 - 06:24 and much, much cooler. So strap in because it's time to break your brain. When scientists smash these protons together, we get a glimpse at what might have happened close to the start of our universe, the Big Bang. That's because the collisions release an enormous amount of energy for how small protons are. But in the grand scheme of things, each collision is still less than the total energy of a hand clap. But a very smart person figured out that energy and mass are related. So when these protons collide at incredibly fast speeds, releasing a ton of energy, that energy can turn into physical mass, which is crazy. And here's the kicker. If the energy is high enough, it can turn into mysterious or unknown particles. More of the building blocks of our universe, which we really want to know about to use that knowledge to improve the world today or to just satisfy our own curiosity. But those special mystery particles, they only exist for an instant before they turn back into more everyday particles that we see all the time that then fly outward towards sensors that record exactly where they hit. So what scientists actually see is more like a crime scene. They can see where the particles hit the sensors, but then they need to work backward using very complex physics to reverse engineer what happened at the moment of collision and what mystery particles could have been there. And if that sounds hard, Time: 06:25 - 07:35 yeah, you're right, but important. We're not just doing this for fun, let's smash things together. We do like it. That's fine. Well, we do it because we have huge, huge questions. The idea with particle physics is to try to understand the fabric of the universe. So, you know, you divide something, you divide it again, you divide it again, until you finally get to something you can't divide anymore, the elementary particles. That's what they're studying in these collisions, elementary particles, the building blocks of our universe. We know a lot of them already. You might recognize some, like electrons or photons, which give us light. We know about all of these elementary particles thanks to brilliant people doing extremely complex math and decades of experimentation to prove that math actually predicts the real world. That math looks like this. This is a beautiful description Time: 07:36 - 08:18 of how we as humans think the world around us works. It's called the standard model. Time: 08:19 - 08:24 We can understand Time: 08:26 - 08:27 a lot about our universe. Where we came from, where we're going, what we're made of. It's pure research to try to understand Time: 08:28 - 08:35 our universe. One reason that they wanted to build the Large Hadron Collider specifically is that the standard model predicted that there should be another particle, a mystery particle, Time: 08:36 - 08:44 particle, likely present near the beginning of our universe, that no one had ever actually detected. They called it the Higgs Boson, or more sensationally, Time: 08:46 - 08:52 the God Particle. The Standard Model seemed to suggest that this God particle was of vital importance to universal existence. Time: 08:52 - 08:59 Because, and here's where my brain starts to break a little bit, it would confirm the existence of an underlying field that gives other particles Time: 09:00 - 09:07 mass. In other words, this God particle would help us understand Time: 09:08 - 09:12 why everything you and I feel Time: 09:12 - 09:14 exists. Time: 09:14 - 09:15 Basically, why stuff exists was a big mystery, and this underlying field was our best mathematical explanation. And observing the Higgs boson, the particle related to this field, would help to prove it. The only problem was that to do that, we needed to get enough energy in one place to create it. Like from smashing two protons together at nearly the speed of light. And that is one big reason to build the Large Hadron Collider. Time: 09:15 - 09:40 So, they built it. And after they finished, thousands of scientists spent two more years collecting data at two different detectors until finally they were sure enough to announce to the world they did it. Time: 09:42 - 09:54 They reliably created the Higgs boson, something that no one had ever detected before, proving a truth about our universe that had before been a mystery. And that proof looked like this. Time: 09:56 - 10:07 Yep, It's a bump on a chart. Think about how much work Time: 10:08 - 10:12 went into seeing Time: 10:12 - 10:13 that bump on that chart. Like, that's it? Yeah. It's awesome. Through math, scientists predicted that if the Higgs boson exists, when we smash particles together, we should see a bump. And there it is. There was literally a bump. There were more particles being produced at that energy. The math was right. Time: 10:14 - 10:30 This confirmation didn't immediately change the world for people like you and me. But it showed us that as a species, we're on the right track. We're never gonna know the impact of discovering any single building block of reality. When Sir Isaac Newton revealed the motion of our moon and our planets, Time: 10:35 - 10:51 he couldn't have possibly imagined there would be humans on the moon nearly three hundred years later. The same is true of our discoveries today. That's the point of all of this. We discover the building blocks now so that our children can build with them later Time: 10:52 - 11:06 in ways that we can't possibly imagine. Time: 11:06 - 11:09 I don't Time: 11:09 - 11:10 know what understanding the Higgs boson is really gonna do to change the way that we live, but in twenty, thirty, fifty years, the better that we understand how these particles work, the more we can create technologies that, Time: 11:10 - 11:23 change our lives. And the Higgs boson was by no means the only thing the Large Hadron Collider has uncovered. It has shaped our understanding of the way that elementary particles interact and combine and put our theories about the world to the test over and over and over again. Time: 11:23 - 11:37 But now some scientists argue that we might have reached a limit on what we can learn from this collider, and there's still so much that we don't know about the universe. Time: 11:41 - 11:49 So some scientists argue that now what we need to do is build a much, much Time: 11:50 - 11:55 bigger one. That's the big debate happening right now. Time: 11:55 - 11:58 There's things we're looking for. Time: 12:01 - 12:02 The big big holes in in in our understanding of the universe. Time: 12:03 - 12:06 We have measured really Time: 12:07 - 12:08 clearly that there's something out there that only acts through gravitation as far as we can tell. He's talking about dark matter. Invisible matter would have been a better name. Doesn't matter. It doesn't, you know, send anything out that we can see with our eyes, but it affects gravitationally and it makes a big difference. We know this dark matter is there because it impacts things that we can see, like the way light visibly bends as it passes galaxies. Through those effects, we can calculate dark matter accounts for 27% Time: 12:09 - 12:35 of our universe. Could a bigger collider help us learn about it? We don't really know. Nobody is guaranteeing it will find dark matter. It might answer something completely different. It might pose new questions. Maybe we'll find something we had no idea was there, and we need to start working on it now. Does it have a name? What It has a horrible name. It has a horrible name. It's called the FCC, Time: 12:35 - 12:55 the Future Circular Collider, which of course you have to change after you've built it. CERN estimates that building this new collider would cost roughly $17,000,000,000 Time: 12:55 - 13:04 and instead of a 27 kilometer loop, it would be a hundred. But not everyone thinks that this is worth it. They argue that the Large Hadron Collider has fallen short of what some hoped that it would achieve. On top of that, some predictions seem to suggest we'd need even more energy than this new bigger collider Time: 13:04 - 13:14 even Time: 13:15 - 13:15 more Time: 13:16 - 13:16 energy than this new bigger collider would have in order to produce anything truly new. I think there's no need to overpromise. Time: 13:17 - 13:23 We don't really know, but that's not a reason not to try. The byproduct of all of the pure science done at CERN has already resulted in new therapies for cancer treatments, better medical imaging, more efficient electric cars, more sensitive radiation detectors that we now use in space, and my favorite, a new way for scientists to communicate, Time: 13:23 - 13:44 now called the World Wide Web. All of that and more came from work done at CERN. We don't know what we'll come up with next. Just imagine for a second what we could do if we we had a better deeper understanding of what gives things mass. The future always sounds like sci fi until we build it. And listen, I am not at all qualified to figure out if this specific collider is what we should build. And there are other ideas out there like a muon collider and a linear collider. There's a proposal for a very powerful collider built in China. But we won't know what's possible without spending on this kind of pure research. And what's embarrassing is for Europe, they still spend twice as much on defense. Time: 13:44 - 14:23 The US spends 10 times as much on defense. You can argue we need to do that right now, and that can very well be true. But we need to get to a world that's better than that. It would be reasonable to say, hey, maybe we should spend this money on other research that would apply more directly to improving people's lives right now today. But is that a real choice? That's a false choice. Fundamental research is essential to be able to do any of that applied research. It'd be like saying, okay, we're gonna have universities Time: 14:23 - 14:51 and maybe secondary education, but we're gonna cut out elementary school and and no kindergarten. Time: 14:51 - 14:56 I feel that we're the kindergarten. We're the very, very basics. Time: 14:56 - 14:59 You have to have all of that. We have come so far in our understanding of the universe, but there is so much left to learn. Like, what's all that extra stuff that we can't see? And where did we come from? And what's coming next? And I think most importantly, Time: 15:00 - 15:15 while we're here, Time: 15:16 - 15:17 what we spend our time on shows who we are. If aliens come to Earth one day and they look at what we have built, I would want them to see enormous Time: 15:17 - 15:27 monuments Time: 15:28 - 15:28 dedicated to knowledge. I would want them to understand through what we have built that we are a species Time: 15:29 - 15:35 who seeks to learn and tries to do better and aches to find where we belong in a universe that we can barely understand. I would want them to see that yes, we are limited and yes, we have conflict and yes, we can only glimpse such a tiny slice of the full scale of reality. But man, Time: 15:35 - 15:57 we try Time: 15:57 - 15:58 so hard and that is something that we can all be very proud of because the effort that we put in today Time: 15:58 - 16:04 can lead to a world we can't even imagine. Time: 16:05 - 16:08 This is one of my favorite scripts to write ever, but it was incredibly hard. This is just such a complex topic and I am not a physicist. So the script was fact checked by a physicist at CERN, but if you wanna know more about the details of the physics here, I'll link to a couple of my favorite explainers by actual physicists on YouTube. And if you want there to be more of this kind of optimistic science and tech journalism, Time: 16:12 - 16:30 subscribe to our show, Huge If True. It really means a lot. It means that we get to go to all of these incredible places and make more videos for you. So it's a big deal. Thank you. See you for the next one. Time: 16:31 - 16:40Loved the final note about how we want an Alien civilization to look at us as a scientific and curious race and not just a planet of conflict and mass destruction",

      "transcript": "Time: 00:01 - 00:08 I've loved dinosaurs since I was a kid, but it turns out that a lot of what I thought I knew is actually Time: 00:12 - 00:17 wrong or at least outdated. Time: 00:18 - 00:19 So in this video, I'm gonna show you the cutting edge of dinosaur discovery. Time: 00:20 - 00:24 I'm gonna give you rare access into a warehouse Time: 00:24 - 00:27 full of dinosaur bones, go out into the field and try to discover my own fossil, and show you something new these scientists just discovered. I think we got ourselves a dinosaur. A new look at dinosaurs. The golden age of dinosaur discovery. Time: 00:27 - 00:41 Uncovering almost one new dinosaur species a week. There's so much more to these amazing creatures than we really have just begun. I think I have a dinosaur Time: 00:44 - 00:51 bone. Time: 00:51 - 00:52 We are in Alberta, Canada, and we are on our way to an active dinosaur dig site. This is a huge moment in dinosaur discovery. Scientists are discovering more dinosaurs now than at any other time in history. They're finding a new species each week on average, and those discoveries Time: 01:00 - 01:16 are shaking up what we thought we knew about these ancient animals. The dig site that we're headed to now is special. The rumor is that they've uncovered something really cool. So I don't know what we're gonna find, but my big goal is to actually help discover a dinosaur bone today. If I could do that Time: 01:17 - 01:31 Oh, my God. The site that we're going to is full of a herd of dinosaurs Time: 01:33 - 01:36 called Pachyrhinosaurus. Time: 01:36 - 01:37 We have the big adults. We have the little babies. We have the teenagers. That's doctor Emily Bamforth, the paleontologist in charge of this site. They're not sure what exactly killed this herd. It could have been a natural disaster like a flood, but they know that it killed them all at the same time. And then later, they were buried in mud that turned to stone over 73,000,000. Time: 01:38 - 01:57 But that's a problem for us today because they're not preserved as individual animals where they fell. They're all sort of mixed together. That's right. So we lovingly refer to it as our Pachyrhinosaurus omelet. Time: 01:58 - 02:09 It's basically Time: 02:11 - 02:12 hundreds, Time: 02:12 - 02:12 potentially thousands Time: 02:13 - 02:14 of animals kind of jumbled up together in this one deposit. Time: 02:14 - 02:17 Putting together a dinosaur is kind of like doing a puzzle except Time: 02:18 - 02:20 You don't know what the picture on the front of the box is. You're missing half the pieces. There's pieces from other puzzles thrown in and then the pieces sometimes are ripped and torn so they don't fit properly. Those are the sticks out puzzles at all. Basically. Yep. So how do you know that you're doing the puzzle right? How do we know that any of these dinosaurs are right? Well, we're about to see how they do it. Oh, wow. Time: 02:21 - 02:42 Oh my Time: 02:43 - 02:43 god. Here we are. This is it. This bone bed is particularly exciting because it's one of the densest dinosaur bone beds in North America. So the estimated number of animals, Time: 02:44 - 02:53 is somewhere from 6,000 Time: 02:54 - 02:55 to 10,000. Time: 02:55 - 02:57 Oh Oh my god. Among all the bones in this huge dinosaur omelet, there's one type that's rare and special to find intact, a skull, and they just found one. So this thing here is a big skull, and everything that's around it is all bone as well. Can I touch it? Bone? Yeah. Go ahead. Time: 02:57 - 03:14 It feels like a rock. It basically is a rock. Woah. Time: 03:14 - 03:17 Are you freaking out right now? Yeah. I'm totally freaking out right now. This is so awesome. Time: 03:18 - 03:23 They're hoping to pull this skull out of the ground in the next few weeks, but if that's a Pachyrhinosaurus Time: 03:25 - 03:30 skull, Time: 03:31 - 03:31 how big was the rest of it? It turns out a lot has changed about what we think dinosaurs actually looked like, including their size. So let me show you. Okay. So I want you to imagine this skull coming out of the ground. It would look like this. Time: 03:32 - 03:45 This dinosaur had a big bony bump on the front of its nose called the boss and a bony frill and horns on the back of its head. Using bones collected in the area and around the world and referencing similar dinosaurs and animals that are alive today, scientists put together the rest of the skeleton like this. Time: 03:49 - 04:04 Now imagine the dinosaur comes back to life. It's about Time: 04:06 - 04:09 that big, Time: 04:09 - 04:10 which is huge. Time: 04:11 - 04:12 Compared to other dinosaurs, this guy was medium in size, which is wild and makes me wonder, how big were the rest of them? If you lined up a bunch of dinosaurs from smallest to largest, you'd see the teeny little Anchiornis, just a little bit bigger than a basketball. You'd see the Compsognathus, Time: 04:12 - 04:28 the size of a small chicken. The famous velociraptor would actually be here, except in real life, they were about this big, which is, Time: 04:28 - 04:36 not the size they looked in Jurassic Time: 04:37 - 04:38 Park. And newer research shows that they didn't look like that. Velociraptors Time: 04:40 - 04:43 had feathers. To be fair to Jurassic Park though, they didn't know that. The reason the velociraptors Time: 04:44 - 04:48 don't have feathers is because we didn't know that those kind of dinosaurs had feathers at the time. In 1998, this discovery in China changed our understanding of what some dinosaurs looked like, and other discoveries since have confirmed that more dinosaurs had feathers than we thought. And there's still a lot of debate about what the color and the outside appearance of dinosaurs actually looked like. We'll get to that in a minute. One step bigger than the Velociraptor would be the Niososaurus, Time: 04:49 - 05:11 about the size of a German shepherd. Time: 05:11 - 05:13 Then our Pachyrhinosaurus Time: 05:13 - 05:14 would be here. One of my favorites, the Triceratops, was about the height of an Asian elephant, but much longer. Here's the Stegosaurus Time: 05:15 - 05:22 and the T Rex. Time: 05:24 - 05:25 And from here on, the sizes get nutty. These dinosaurs were bigger than school buses. They were taller Time: 05:27 - 05:33 buildings. One of the largest known dinosaurs, the Argentinosaurus, Time: 05:34 - 05:37 was about as long and heavier Time: 05:37 - 05:40 than a commercial Time: 05:40 - 05:41 airplane. Can you imagine what it was like when these animals walked the Earth? Time: 05:41 - 05:47 But here's the thing, they didn't all walk it at the same time. Really common misconception is that all dinosaurs lived all at the same time. Dinosaurs lived for way longer than most people think. Time: 05:48 - 05:58 If this is all of recorded human history Time: 05:59 - 06:02 and this is the time since humans diverged from apes, Time: 06:03 - 06:07 this is the time when dinosaurs were alive. Time: 06:08 - 06:11 Dinosaurs ruled the Earth for a hundred and eighty million years. We are Time: 06:11 - 06:17 nothing in comparison. And the dinosaurs that we know today were spread out through this enormous history, which means that some of the dinosaurs I think of as being alive at the same time were actually separated by Time: 06:18 - 06:28 millions of years. There was more time that separates Stegosaurus from T. Rex than separates T. Rex from us. Time: 06:29 - 06:36 What? Yeah. That's an amazing fact. I had no idea. The Stegosaurus Time: 06:36 - 06:40 was an ancient relic to the T. Rex. Time: 06:41 - 06:43 My whole childhood was a lie. Time: 06:44 - 06:45 They're about to let me look for some dinosaur bones. Time: 06:48 - 06:51 I've been waiting for this moment my whole entire life, so no pressure. But if I don't find something, I'm gonna be devastated. I'm Time: 06:51 - 06:59 probably not gonna find it. I'm probably gonna find, like, a chicken bone, but just searching. I'm so psyched. But first, let me show you something. I'm trying to correct what I got wrong about dinosaurs, but understanding the news, especially science news, can be a challenge. That's why for this story, I wanted to partner with Ground News. Their website and app gathers related articles on the same topic in one place so you can compare coverage and get a more well rounded understanding of an issue. I use Ground News to understand the information that I'm reading, where it's coming from, and how factual it is, which is something that I care a lot about. And it's crucial for making huge if true. Like here, a few months ago, the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to AI researchers. On ground news, I can see that over 300 news outlets reported on this. They also show you the political leaning of those news outlets and how reliable their reporting practices are. Plus, I can compare all the headlines. One outlet likens AI to the invention of penicillin, which changed the world, while another raises concerns about potential negative consequences of AI. I wanna see the differences because I care about how news is framed, particularly when it comes to science and tech. If you do too, I think you'll appreciate Gram News. And right now, they're offering huge if true viewers 50% off their vantage plan. To check it out, just scan this QR code or go to ground.news/clio. Time: 07:01 - 08:04 Make sure to scan the QR code or use this link if you do sign up because that helps out this channel. Big thanks to Ground News for sponsoring this video and for supporting optimistic independent journalism. Time: 08:04 - 08:12 Now back to the story. Alright. Here's how to hunt for dinosaurs. There are two rules. So the first one is that you always wanna be working horizontal to the bone layer. The reason being, like, as soon as you do this, you run the risk of, like, accidentally stabbing a bone. Yeah. The second rule is to always keep your sight clean. So we say a clean sight is a happy sight. Alright. The moment I've been waiting for my whole life. Here I go. Just just I'm just gonna be here for a while. Just so you guys you guys can go. Time: 08:12 - 08:38 But as I worked, I wondered, how many of each dinosaur have we found? Some huge proportion of species are known from a single specimen, which is crazy. Yeah. Turns out, almost half of all dinosaur species are known from a single specimen, Time: 08:41 - 08:56 and many of those fossils are incomplete, Time: 08:57 - 08:59 meaning we take the pieces that we do find and we extrapolate what the rest of it could have looked like. That makes the job of identifying what's a new species and what's just a piece of an already existing dinosaur really tricky. We are nowhere near having all the dinosaurs that ever lived. And the dinosaurs that we have found aren't final. They're an ongoing Time: 09:00 - 09:16 group project among scientists all around the world. Take for example, maybe the world's most famous dinosaur, the T Rex, Time: 09:17 - 09:23 didn't look like you think. Scientists and artists have been imagining dinosaurs for hundreds of years. Based on early discoveries, they thought that the T Rex was a lean predator that stood upright like a kangaroo. You may have seen their traditional T Rex in the kangaroo pose, like standing up with his tail dragging on the ground. But the more they compared the T Rex's hip and thigh bones to modern upright animals, Time: 09:24 - 09:44 they realized that they didn't quite make sense. New computer models showed that standing upright would put too much weight on its hips, but leaning forward Time: 09:44 - 09:53 would be much more stable. We now Time: 09:53 - 09:55 understand these animals are more like teeter totters. And they weren't very lean either. Rib like bones were found with this old famous T. Rex skeleton, Sue. But it wasn't until 2018 when they realized that these ribs would have had to float in the T. Rex's abdomen like crocodiles have today. And they realized that the T. Rex would have been way chunkier than they thought, which means that it was probably an ambush predator jumping out at you, not a pursuit predator chasing you down in a jeep. In fact, most dinosaurs were chunkier than people thought. But before I show you that, Time: 09:56 - 10:24 do you think that's a bone? I'm pretty sure both of these are bones. I'm pretty sure I found a dinosaur bone. I think I'm touching a dinosaur bone right now. Oh my god. Might also be a bone of, like, a large chicken or something. Time: 10:25 - 10:38 Am I right? There's okay. I think there's two bones. I think this is a bone, and I think this is a bone under here too. Yep. Oh my god. They're everywhere. I also didn't realize that I narrowly avoided disaster. This is bone two, actually. Time: 10:39 - 10:50 Stop. Really? Yep. Alright. I didn't spot that one. Time: 10:50 - 10:53 How do you know? Time: 10:53 - 10:54 I can see, like, those little white Time: 10:55 - 10:57 specks in there. Uh-huh. That's kinda like the arrow chocolate bar. Look at the texture of this. I had no idea what I was looking at. I thought I was looking for something like that, which is the outside of the mod. Yeah. That is the cross section. That's the arrow bar part, the inside texture. Time: 10:57 - 11:13 Good thing I didn't Time: 11:14 - 11:15 chip away at that one. Time: 11:15 - 11:16 Thank you. This is one of the coolest experiences in my life. I realize that this is just like another Tuesday for you, but this is really cool. Time: 11:17 - 11:25 It is pretty cool. Like I said, the thrill never wears off. But finding a bone isn't even the coolest part. We gotta get it back to the lab. Is there any hope of actually pulling that bone out of the ground? I think so. To get it out of the ground intact, we had to make this paste and then paint it over the bone and wait until it dried. And while we were waiting, I realized that I still had a very basic question about all of this. And after I learned the answer, I'm never gonna look at a chicken the same way. What qualifies as a dinosaur? Time: 11:25 - 11:53 Good question. It is Time: 11:53 - 11:55 a phylogenetic question. Time: 11:55 - 11:57 Alright. So your great great great great great great great great great great great great great grandfather, over 10 to 15,000,000 Time: 11:57 - 12:05 generations back, was a little lizard like creature called an amniote. Time: 12:05 - 12:08 Scientists think that this was your most recent common ancestor with dinosaurs. Time: 12:08 - 12:12 Over millions of years, the amniote's kids adapted, and scientists grouped up the new species depending on their different characteristics. Scientifically speaking, a dinosaur Time: 12:12 - 12:20 is everything from here Time: 12:21 - 12:23 onward, which means some of the animals that people often call dinosaurs Time: 12:23 - 12:26 actually aren't. So things like pterosaurs that actually belong to a different group of reptiles, things like mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, iphiosaurs are also not dinosaurs. Time: 12:27 - 12:35 They live at the same time, but they belong to different groups of reptiles. Time: 12:35 - 12:38 Crocodiles were alive back then too, which is crazy. But they're not dinosaurs because they actually branched off earlier. But if everything that descended from this branch onward is a dinosaur, Time: 12:38 - 12:50 then that means birds were dinosaurs and therefore they are also dinosaurs. Time: 12:51 - 12:55 Birds are not the descendants of dinosaurs. Time: 12:56 - 12:58 They are actually dinosaurs by the most scientific definition. Dinosaurs Time: 12:58 - 13:03 are still alive Time: 13:04 - 13:05 and they're all around you. Time: 13:05 - 13:07 But hang on. Time: 13:10 - 13:11 I thought that a meteor hit the Earth and caused the dinosaurs to go extinct. Time: 13:11 - 13:16 But if birds are still alive and birds are dinosaurs, Time: 13:16 - 13:19 what actually happened after the meteor hit? To answer that question, we gotta go to the lab. Time: 13:19 - 13:25 Oh my god. This is like Santa's workshop. Time: 13:28 - 13:31 This is the coolest place I've ever met. Let me show you some of the coolest things here. This is a tyrannosaur tooth. Look at the serrated edges right there. You see it? Cutting flesh. Look at that. That is a This is a break. Time: 13:32 - 13:45 That healed. That healed. Yep. Time: 13:46 - 13:47 Woah. So this is actually really important. It's basically, like, kind of fossilized physiology or fossilized behavior, Time: 13:48 - 13:54 which is not something that's easy to find in the fossil record. Incredible. Time: 13:54 - 13:58 So we It also just reinforces Time: 13:59 - 14:00 these were living Time: 14:01 - 14:02 animals. They Time: 14:02 - 14:03 had whole lives where they did all kinds of things and healed and, you know, had injuries and Yep. And got sick too. Time: 14:04 - 14:12 So this has a really abnormal growth, bone growth right at the end of it. Mhmm. So we think that's either osteoarthritis Time: 14:13 - 14:19 or potentially a bone cancer. Oh. Time: 14:20 - 14:22 So if you were to Dinosaurs got cancer? Yeah. Time: 14:22 - 14:25 We saw so many amazing things And finally, I got to touch Time: 14:29 - 14:33 dinosaur skin. That is not skin impression. That's the actual skin. So you can touch it if you want, like you're petting a dinosaur. It feels like what I imagine an enormous chicken, Time: 14:33 - 14:42 yep, foot would feel like. And on this one, this is another layer of skin. Time: 14:43 - 14:47 So you if you look closely, you can see there are different kinds of scales. Yeah. Touching dinosaur skin was incredible. Time: 14:47 - 14:53 I closed my eyes and I imagined Time: 14:54 - 14:56 meeting a dinosaur. Time: 14:57 - 14:58 And then looking at the skin, my question was Do we know anything about color? Good question. Time: 15:03 - 15:09 So in general, Time: 15:10 - 15:10 we know what color some dinosaurs were, the feathered dinosaurs in particular, because the feathers will sometimes preserve pigment. Based on pigments in fossilized feathers, they know that some feathered dinosaurs were black and white with shiny feathers, and some had rust or deep red colors. Skin doesn't preserve color, but they have found shading, meaning that some dinosaurs likely had stripes. We don't know if those stripes were black and white, you know, if they were tan and black. We're not really sure of the color. The dinosaurs that you see reconstructed, it's based on our understanding of modern animals, how modern animals are colored. But a little creative liberty in color isn't the main problem with dinosaur depictions today. Look at this. You might not recognize it, but this is a modern animal alive today. If you took its skeleton and treated it in the same way that many early science illustrators treated dinosaurs. The problem here is they just wrapped the skin around the skeleton without taking into account any of the muscle and the fat, turning this animal into a monster. Can you guess what it is? That's a zebra. Time: 15:11 - 16:08 How about this one? Time: 16:10 - 16:11 That's a baboon. Time: 16:11 - 16:12 This one's my favorite. Time: 16:13 - 16:14 That's a hippo. If we treated it like science illustrators treated dinosaurs. This is called shrink wrapping. And today, we now know that's probably not an accurate reflection of dinosaurs. They would have had a lot of muscle mass. Yep. Like, just to move those things around. Today, artists and scientists are working to correct that, adding more loose skin and muscles and fatty tissues, redefining what dinosaurs realistically looked Time: 16:15 - 16:36 like. Every bone that comes to the lab from the field needs to get cleaned, so time to clean ours. So this is still covered in mud, but when it's clean, it'll look more like this surface right here. Sort of, you can see the shine. This is a rib that is Time: 16:37 - 16:51 pretty close to being fully prepared. So you can see there's that shiny chocolate brown color. These bones are brown because they're not like your bones right now. In fact, what we've been calling bones are really rocks. All dinosaur bones are fossilized, which means they're now made of rock. You can think of of fossil bones as basically Time: 16:52 - 17:10 an exact copy of the bone just made out of rock. The original bone material is there, but over millions of years, the minerals replaced the bone kind of like cell by cell basically. And so it's an exact copy of what the bone looked like. It's just now made out of rock. Every dinosaur in every museum is a stone replica of what was once a living, breathing animal, Time: 17:11 - 17:32 which brings me to my last question. How did the big dinosaurs Time: 17:32 - 17:35 actually die? It started sixty six point o four million years ago on a normal day in the dinosaur kingdom, except that a speck appeared in the sky. And over a few weeks, it got bigger and bigger and bigger until a huge rock, wider than Mount Everest is tall, traveling at 20 to 30 kilometers per second, hit the Earth right here. So hard it vaporized the entire space rock immediately, Time: 17:36 - 18:00 but catapulted chunks of Earth beyond the Time: 18:00 - 18:03 moon. And on the surface, it created an apocalypse. There would have been, this is what kind of terrifies me about this extinction, something called a thermal pulse, which is basically a wave of heat. There would have been mega tsunamis that rippled across the planet. The immediate impact would have been awful to live through. But for the dinosaurs that did, the worst was still coming because the whole planet was going dark. The ejecta from the impact itself would have blocked out the sun. With less light, the plants died. And the animals that ate the plants and the animals that ate them and up and up and up. And the things that survive Time: 18:05 - 18:38 are the things that are Time: 18:39 - 18:41 small. They're the size of a German shepherd and smaller. Things that had some kind of refugia so they could go into water or they could live underground. It must have been so scary. The fact that anything survived is pretty incredible. After a hundred and eighty million years, Time: 18:41 - 18:55 the reign of the dinosaurs Time: 18:56 - 18:57 was over. Time: 18:58 - 18:58 What would the world have looked like if that rock had Time: 18:59 - 19:02 missed? Time: 19:02 - 19:03 We'll never know. Time: 19:04 - 19:05 But ultimately, like a bad day on planet Earth for the dinosaurs, but a really great day for mammals. I mean, we are here today because of that extinction. Time: 19:05 - 19:13 We are here today because of this whole crazy history, because dinosaurs lived and because they died. I think I liked dinosaurs as a kid because Time: 19:14 - 19:22 monsters. But the more I learn, I see they weren't monsters at all. They were animals. Time: 19:23 - 19:28 Animals Time: 19:28 - 19:29 that ruled the Earth for millions of years before Time: 19:29 - 19:32 us. And now Time: 19:33 - 19:34 I love them. And I love humans Time: 19:34 - 19:36 for how much care we take to study them. And the reason that we do that isn't just to understand how we got here, but also to understand where we're going. The world we live in is just one very small slice of geologic time. Each different age can tell us something different about life on planet Earth. Where we've been, where we are, and where we're going in the future. This is the golden age of paleontology, Time: 19:36 - 19:56 and there is still Time: 19:57 - 19:58 so much that we don't know. And with more time and with more technology and more science, who knows what other mysteries are left to Time: 19:58 - 20:06 be unlocked? Time: 20:09 - 20:10Chickens are dinosaurs. That means all chicken nuggets are dino nuggets.",

      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:03 Max Verstappen Time: 00:07 - 00:07 is champion Time: 00:08 - 00:09 of the world. You've been hearing about f one too. Right? Cool. Let's talk about it. Formula one racing into Miami for the first time. Hottest ticket in town. Look, Tom, drive to survive. Drive to survive. Drive to survive. This is a car race at over 200 miles an hour in cities all over the world. Miami Grand Prix. Bahrain Grand Prix. Here in Monaco. With insanely Time: 00:09 - 00:32 famous drivers. Daniel Riccardo. Lewis Hamilton seven time world. And hundred person teams racing cars so advanced that they're practically spaceships Time: 00:32 - 00:39 and so expensive that they had to make rule that teams couldn't spend more than a hundred and $40,000,000 Time: 00:40 - 00:47 each. And it's only getting bigger. Just look at this. This is from a construction camera at one of two new US race tracks. This one's in Miami. This cost $40,000,000 Time: 00:47 - 00:56 to build, and it hosted nearly a quarter of a million people over three days. That's a Super Bowl worth of people every day. And one of them was me. Time: 00:56 - 01:05 It's the first ever Miami Grand Prix. We're racing in The States, and it's lights out, away we go. Time: 01:06 - 01:11 This is the coolest thing. I just love f one. But a lot of people, because of all this hype, they're hearing about it right now for the first time, and they're feeling a little bit, Time: 01:11 - 01:21 I don't understand. So let's get into it. This is f one explained for rookies. Time: 01:22 - 01:26 What you need to know to keep up with this crazy Time: 01:26 - 01:29 expensive sport that everyone's suddenly obsessed with. Lewis Hamilton. Bruce Abbott, Fulton. He's done. But it's also a look at the bigger question here, the huge question, which is, Time: 01:30 - 01:39 why do this? Like, why pour so much money, so much technological Time: 01:40 - 01:44 effort into f one, into entertainment? Time: 01:45 - 01:47 The answer isn't what we get in return. This isn't just a car race. This is a space program Time: 01:49 - 01:54 for the road. General growth in interest Time: 01:54 - 01:57 f one's becoming much more of a thing here in The States. The Monaco Time: 01:58 - 02:01 Grand Prix. Time: 02:01 - 02:02 Win the Italian Grand Prix. Bahrain Grand Prix. Time: 02:03 - 02:06 If you're new to f one, you might know its American cousins. Time: 02:11 - 02:14 NASCAR has the least family resemblance. Time: 02:14 - 02:16 Closed cockpits, oval tracks, Time: 02:16 - 02:18 IndyCar and f one look more related. They've got the spaghetti looking track, open cockpits. Time: 02:19 - 02:25 But there's one really important difference between these two, and it's the reason why f one specifically is such a big deal. In IndyCar, all of the cars use the same frame or chassis, the DW 12. So the competition here is mostly in how you race that car. But in f one, every team has to design and manufacture Time: 02:25 - 02:43 their own cars, and the best part is that they get to improve the cars between each race or not depending on how they do. So the competition in f one actually centers around the car itself, not just how you race it, but also how you build it and rebuild it again and again and again. Time: 02:44 - 03:00 This is why I love f one. It looks like the sport of daredevils, Time: 03:00 - 03:04 but much more than that. It's the sport of nerds. Time: 03:05 - 03:08 Okay. Each team races two cars, so two drivers for the same team. Each event or Grand Prix is three days. Practice, qualifying, and race day. Time: 03:12 - 03:21 I watch these on TV every time they're on, but this was the first time I ever got to see it in person. Time: 03:22 - 03:28 I have to see the car up close. That was awesome. Time: 03:28 - 03:30 Now I am inside the Mercedes garage. Truly, I have never had more fun at a sporting event Time: 03:32 - 03:37 and seen less of what was actually going on. So right now, they're about to do a practice pitch. Time: 03:37 - 03:42 Here's how this works. The order of who does the fastest lap on qualifying day becomes the lineup at the starting line on race day. And passing isn't easy, so the where you start is a really big deal. Depending on where drivers finish, they get different numbers of points. After tenth place, no points for you. No soup for you. Drivers wanna get the most points themselves to win something called the driver's championship, Time: 03:43 - 04:02 but teams wanna get the most points total to win the constructor's championship. The two championship thing actually kinda makes for funny mismatched incentives sometimes. You can hear it on the radio when teams have one strategy, like, they wanna let drivers pass each other, and drivers get really mad about that. Maybe it's quicker in that week. Time: 04:03 - 04:20 Not very unfair, Time: 04:20 - 04:21 but okay. But generally, everybody agrees about the big things, which are drivers, race your fastest. Teams, Time: 04:21 - 04:28 make the best car. Time: 04:28 - 04:30 Alright. Time: 04:33 - 04:33 Here's the fun part. Time: 04:33 - 04:35 Lego is here. Hey, Time: 04:38 - 04:40 kids. Time: 04:40 - 04:41 What? Here's my driver. Hello, Lewis Hamilton. Time: 04:41 - 04:44 Think of an f one car like an airplane upside down. Time: 04:46 - 04:49 Both meant to move as quickly through the air as possible. Right? But where an airplane's wings work to lift it up, these car's wings work to keep it down. Time: 04:51 - 04:58 Why? Because winning doesn't just depend on going fast. It also depends on keeping control. Time: 04:59 - 05:03 And that requires a firm grip on the ground. Time: 05:07 - 05:10 Take a look at the shape of this car. Now watch how the air moves across it. See how some goes above the wing and some squeezes the long way underneath Time: 05:11 - 05:19 it? That creates a situation where there's higher pressure above and lower pressure below, sucking the car toward the ground. That's actually happening all over the car, not just on the wings, and we could talk for hours about the design features on this thing, how they shape and use the air. Time: 05:19 - 05:34 Some pull air in through the car to cool it down. You can actually see there's a hole there. I think they're trying to imply that on my LEGO model. Time: 05:34 - 05:42 Some actually let the driver release air, lessening that downward pressure and allowing them to go faster in order to pass, kind of like a Mario boost. Time: 05:42 - 05:49 You can actually hear this in a race. Listen for DRS here. Now, Charles Leclerc is gonna have DRS to try and fight it back. Taken together, an f one car is Time: 05:50 - 05:59 just a symphony of aerodynamics. Time: 05:59 - 06:01 I actually got to see them up close and personal when I was in Miami. We're going there. Time: 06:04 - 06:08 I absolutely did not keep people going. That's how we do Time: 06:09 - 06:12 it. Time: 06:12 - 06:13 You can see teams perfecting these cars over the years, understanding the need for wings and adding them and changing the shape and pushing our understanding of aerodynamics to shave off just fractions of a second. Time: 06:14 - 06:26 Hundreds, sometimes thousands of people work on this all for one team. Time: 06:26 - 06:30 So, Time: 06:30 - 06:31 how much does this cost? Time: 06:33 - 06:35 F one teams don't really wanna share the details here, so there's a lot of speculation. Time: 06:38 - 06:42 But they're also companies, and some of them have to file their financials Time: 06:43 - 06:47 somewhere. So with a little bit of research into various European countries' reporting requirements Time: 06:47 - 06:52 hold on. Time: 06:52 - 06:53 Here they are. Time: 06:58 - 06:59 Annual reports for every f one team I could find, Time: 06:59 - 07:02 which is actually eight out of 10. So I'm feeling pretty good about it. It's pretty good. As a fan, this is kind of cool. Like, look, this is this is Toto Wolff's signature. Time: 07:02 - 07:11 What I learned from all this is that running an f one team costs anywhere from 95,000,000 Time: 07:12 - 07:17 to $425,000,000. Time: 07:17 - 07:19 Oh, that's a lot of money. But the year after these were filed, f one instituted a new rule saying all teams were only allowed to spend a hundred and $40,000,000. Time: 07:19 - 07:28 So these reports are gonna look a lot different for this next coming year. Oh, good. Still a lot. No matter what, f one teams spend a ton of money. Time: 07:28 - 07:37 So Time: 07:39 - 07:40 what do they make? Time: 07:40 - 07:41 These reports show that f one teams make approximately Time: 07:41 - 07:45 nothing. Time: 07:46 - 07:46 They run surprisingly close to breakeven. Red Bull, for example, made 230,000,000 Time: 07:47 - 07:53 in revenue and then add these two up, 229,000,000 Time: 07:53 - 07:57 in costs. Time: 07:57 - 07:57 And they ended up with Time: 07:58 - 08:00 approximately Time: 08:00 - 08:01 1,200,000.0 Time: 08:02 - 08:03 in profit. This is in pounds actually, so that's $1,500,000. Time: 08:03 - 08:07 These aren't the wildly profitable enterprises I was imagining. Time: 08:07 - 08:11 So why do they do it? Well, take a look at this. This is the Ferrari annual report. Time: 08:11 - 08:17 Our brand image depends in part on the success of our formula one racing team. The racing team is a key component of our marketing strategy. Time: 08:17 - 08:25 It's advertising. Advertising. Time: 08:25 - 08:27 Advertising. It's a wonderful it's crazy. They use f one to sell other stuff, whether that's luxury sports cars or a sports drink. Red Bull gives you wings. I mean, as entertainment, f one is incredible, Time: 08:27 - 08:39 but a lot of people do feel that it's somewhat Time: 08:39 - 08:42 wasteful. How much does a Formula one car cost? 400,000,000. Time: 08:42 - 08:46 Is it worth all that money? This is bigger than f one. It's kind of crazy to think think about how much work we as a species put into entertaining ourselves. But I think what makes f one feel particularly acute for some people is the technology element here. All of this engineering work and all of this energy being spent on 20 fossil fuel reliant cars Time: 08:46 - 09:06 makes people wonder sometimes if that energy might be better spent elsewhere. Like literally anywhere else. Time: 09:06 - 09:11 But f one is more than just entertainment. Time: 09:14 - 09:16 It's better thought of actually as one giant experiment. Time: 09:16 - 09:20 F one pushes everything to the extreme. What do you need to create to compete at this level, to keep control at these speeds, to keep the driver safe in these conditions? Time: 09:23 - 09:33 The idea is that the technology that they build ends up trickling down to all of us non race car drivers. My question was, is this actually true or does it just sound good? Time: 09:33 - 09:43 I wanted to find specific car parts that were developed for f one and then ended up in my car. But the more research I did, the more complicated it got. People often talk about paddle shifters, for example, but those were actually developed decades before f one. F f one teams just made them better. Time: 09:43 - 09:58 Same for active suspension, anti lock brakes, traction control. Time: 09:58 - 10:02 What I found was that f one was less trickle down and more flywheel. Time: 10:02 - 10:06 F one combines technologies that might already exist Time: 10:07 - 10:10 and then pushes them to an extreme, Time: 10:10 - 10:12 making them better in the process and then inspiring or literally manufacturing Time: 10:12 - 10:17 better tech for all of us. For example, take thermal efficiency, the percentage of energy from combustion that actually makes the car go as opposed to being lost to heat. Time: 10:17 - 10:26 Most combustion road cars have a thermal efficiency between 2030%, Time: 10:26 - 10:30 which means only a third of the energy actually makes the car go. F one cars can't refuel during the race, so there's a very strong incentive for them to be efficient. They're at about 50% now, thanks to new hybrid engines, gains that have been dragging the rest of the car industry forward. Time: 10:30 - 10:45 Or data collection. Sensors on f one cars collect huge amounts of information and then feed it back to the driver and the team. They didn't invent a lot of these systems, but they use them in ways that they've never been used before. And that's actually getting more and more important as we move potentially towards self driving cars. This is the real promise of f one, and it all stems from that original requirement to build their own cars. Basically, Time: 10:45 - 11:08 we'll do all of this research and development, and we'll create new technologies and also combine all of the cutting edge tech, and we'll push it to its limits and develop it further, and you don't even need to pay for it. We'll race these things against other groups of engineers doing exactly the same thing Time: 11:08 - 11:23 in this crazy round the world sport that lots of people really love Time: 11:24 - 11:29 that is actually, at the end of the day, the biggest most expensive group project science competition of all time. Time: 11:29 - 11:36 People debate whether or not we should spend money on lots of our efforts to learn, and yet they consistently push forward both the tech that we actually use and our understanding of the world around us. In this case, it also makes some money and it's fun to watch. Time: 11:38 - 11:52 I think once you see the promise of f one, it allows you to think differently about lots of things. We need people working Time: 11:55 - 12:01 far beyond the edge, like pulling forward the limits of what we can do. The question now is what do we need to learn next? Time: 12:01 - 12:08 If f one pushes forward car innovation and the future of cars is electric, Time: 12:10 - 12:15 does f one need to get more electric too? Time: 12:15 - 12:18 And if f one doesn't go more electric, does it get farther and farther from its original promise over time, less applicable to the technology that we use and more a novelty. Oh, let's go watch those cars that use gas. Time: 12:21 - 12:33 I don't know. Now you're up to speed. You can watch a race, you can enjoy it with your friends, and you can also speculate like the rest of us where it's all gonna go. I'll be watching with you, and I'll be rooting Time: 12:33 - 12:44 for my favorite team. Time: 12:44 - 12:46 I'm I'm gonna butcher that. Grand Prix? Grand Prix? I'm such an American. Time: 12:53 - 12:57Me: i've been watching F1 my whole life Also me: lets watch f1 explained for rookies :D",

Teams that are\nnot manufacturers or a pure marketing play like Williams have applied\ntechnologies departments to consult with a lot of industries on how their F1\nknowledge can be applied.

      "transcript": "Time: 00:01 - 00:08 This is a one of a kind supersonic flight. Time: 00:10 - 00:13 Wait. Hold on. We gotta go back. Time: 00:13 - 00:15 Twenty years ago, you could fly in a plane going faster than sound. Time: 00:16 - 00:20 Why can't you do that now? This supersonic plane, the Concorde, could get from New York to London in three and a half hours, and it was Time: 00:21 - 00:27 so cool. Time: 00:28 - 00:29 It flew at an altitude so high, you could see the curve of the Earth, all while popping champagne. Time: 00:33 - 00:38 But then, that all changed. Time: 00:41 - 00:43 The Concorde is no more. Concorde will never take to the skies again. These planes stopped flying, and we never made any more like them. Today, New York to London takes seven hours. But why? Time: 00:44 - 00:55 What happened to supersonic planes? Time: 00:55 - 00:57 And more importantly, Time: 00:58 - 00:59 can we bring them back? If you ask NASA, Time: 00:59 - 01:02 the answer is yes. We got to go see their brand new experimental supersonic plane that they're building. Here's what's really huge if true. If NASA succeeds, they could bring back commercial supersonic flight, allowing you and me to fly faster than sound. Supersonic. Supersonic. Supersonic airplanes. Time: 01:02 - 01:19 X 59, our new supersonic Time: 01:21 - 01:23 airliner twice as fast as current airliners. Twice the speed of sound. Twice the speed of sound. You're going faster than the Earth rotates. It's the only way to cross the Atlantic. So we're now going supersonic. Yep. Time: 01:23 - 01:35 You ready? I'm ready. Let's do this. Let's go see a supersonic plane. Time: 01:40 - 01:44 When we say supersonic, I know it's faster than sound, but exactly how fast are we talking? For comparison, the world's fastest train can go around 286 Time: 01:49 - 01:58 miles per hour. The fastest car goes around three thirty. Your average Boeing seven thirty seven today will cruise at around five twenty miles per hour. And once you reach around seven sixty seven miles per hour, you're at the speed of sound, also called Mach one. The Concorde? It went thirteen Time: 01:58 - 02:14 fifty miles per hour. For reference, that's roughly the same top speed as a military f 16 fighter jet today. And now, twenty years after the Concorde's last flight, NASA is trying to build a new supersonic plane, and we're on our way to go see it. Time: 02:15 - 02:28 We've entered the land of the planes Time: 02:29 - 02:31 in a weird, Time: 02:31 - 02:32 short palm Time: 02:33 - 02:34 trees. Time: 02:35 - 02:36 Let's do it. We're here at Skunk Works where Lockheed Martin is building a supersonic plane for NASA. This plane is really cool. There aren't that many images of it online. It's possible that we're, like, one of the only teams to ever see it, which makes me feel awesome. I kind of can't believe that we got this shoot, if I'm honest, because we just emailed NASA. And we were like, hey, we know you're working on this supersonic plane. Is there any chance that we can come see it? And they said yes, but there was this very long security clearance process. And then we got this email just a couple weeks ago. You're allowed to come visit on this day for these two hours. So here we are. Time: 02:37 - 03:09 Is that the plane? So this is it. Time: 03:13 - 03:14 This is the x 59. Time: 03:16 - 03:19 This plane is beautiful and weird looking. In order to understand what NASA's building here, you need to understand how a supersonic plane actually works. And the best way to do that is, Time: 03:19 - 03:30 obviously, Time: 03:30 - 03:31 LEGOs. I'm just gonna try to fit LEGOs into as many episodes as possible. Okay? This LEGO set is of the original Concord, and it's a plane that was just the physical embodiment of a simple fact about our species, Time: 03:32 - 03:44 which is that humans Time: 03:44 - 03:45 just love speed. Time: 03:46 - 03:47 What's this? Time: 03:56 - 03:57 Oh, my God. There are more in here. Look how thick the instruction book is. Time: 03:58 - 04:02 545 Time: 04:03 - 04:04 pages long. Time: 04:04 - 04:05 What have I gotten myself into? So in the 1960s, when the Concorde was originally designed, passenger planes looked pretty similar to what they look like today. But the Concorde looked like this. Time: 04:06 - 04:17 The shape still looks futuristic. Time: 04:17 - 04:19 It still looks like every child's paper dart. That's captain Mike Bannister, the former chief Concorde pilot at British Airways. I flew over a total of twenty two years. Flying Concord was an absolute Time: 04:19 - 04:30 joy. You are flying something that's traveling at 23 miles a minute on the edge of space where the sky got darker, where you could see the curvature of the Earth. You're traveling so quickly that you're going faster than the Earth rotates. And when you got close to her, you could see the elegance in design. Now I gotta actually build this thing. Time: 04:30 - 04:48 Look. It's coming together. You can see some of the features on it already. This plane had a long narrow body to streamline air resistance. It had these very wide delta shaped wings to generate lift. It had this funny long nose called the droop snoop that drooped upon takeoff and landing so that the pilots could see. Time: 04:56 - 05:11 See that? Time: 05:12 - 05:13 And special powerful engines that could handle the rapid incoming air, even special paint that discharged heat. And the price to go this fast wasn't cheap. Time: 05:14 - 05:22 And tons of people paid lots of money to experience the thrill of riding supersonic. But once you hit the speed of sound, something happens. Time: 05:23 - 05:31 Let me play that again. Time: 05:32 - 05:33 Folks are aware that supersonic aircraft make a sonic boom, which we as human beings do here as a a double bang. Boom boom. If you listen carefully, you can hear that double boom. Time: 05:35 - 05:45 Alright. I need to spend some time building. Time: 05:46 - 05:48 As the plane flies, it pushes air out of its path, creating pressure waves at the front and back of the plane. When a plane flies faster than the speed of sound, the air molecules literally cannot move out of the way in time. And so they get compressed together. They form a a wave off the front of the airplane and a second wave off the back. When those pressure waves reach our ears, our brains process them as sound, a massive Time: 05:56 - 06:17 boom. But a common misconception Time: 06:18 - 06:19 is that a sonic boom doesn't just boom once when the plane hits that speed. It booms the whole time all along the path of the plane, carpeting the ground below it, meaning everyone under the flight of the plane hears the sonic boom. Weirdly though, inside the plane, you don't hear the boom at all. There was no indication whatsoever Time: 06:20 - 06:37 physically on the airplane of going through the sound barrier. You're traveling as fast as the pressure waves are. We put an indicator in the cabin so the customers knew when they were going through the sound barrier because otherwise they wouldn't have done. So we're coming Time: 06:38 - 06:50 But for those on the ground, the boom was loud. For context, if this is how loud distant thunder is, and this is how loud a hand clap is and the firework, this is how loud the Concord sonic boom was from the ground. Time: 06:52 - 07:04 Just below a balloon pop. Because of how loud supersonic booms are, in 1973 the FAA changed their rules and banned commercial supersonic flights over The United States, and similar rules followed around the world. This meant that companies could mostly only offer flights over the ocean, which dramatically reduced their routes. Plus, these fuel dazzling engines and rising fuel costs, combined with a deadly crash in February, Time: 07:07 - 07:28 hurt public perception of supersonic flight. And finally, Air France chose to stop flying the Concorde, eventually forcing British Airways, the only company now paying for the upkeep of the aging planes, to stop flying them as well. And so in early two thousand and three, on April, British Airways very reluctantly Time: 07:28 - 07:44 announced that they were retiring their Concorde fleet. And on the very last flight, we invited a hundred people at British Airways expense to join us on that last flight and getting the message across that this was something that they should really be proud to have been part of. The Concorde was ahead of its time. But even as advanced as it was, it couldn't overcome the problem of the sonic boom. But what if we could fix that? That is what NASA is trying to do. Time: 07:44 - 08:10 The X-fifty nine is NASA's attempt at fixing the boom problem. It's a single seater jet that can travel at 925 Time: 08:14 - 08:20 miles per hour or 1.4 times the speed of sound. And it's specifically engineered to prove that supersonic planes can be quiet. That's Kathy Baum, the NASA lead on this effort. And these are the leads from Lockheed Martin, Dave Richards, and Mike Buono. Our goal is to change that regulation Time: 08:20 - 08:36 so that it says as long as you are below this sound level, then you can fly supersonically over land. To achieve this goal, NASA referenced design features found on the Concorde, including those large delta wings, the very streamlined body, and that narrow nose. But the nose on the x x 59 is much longer. There's no way you can miss our 38 foot Time: 08:37 - 08:59 nose. Time: 08:59 - 09:00 Unlike the Concorde, this 38 foot carbon fiber nose doesn't move, which means the pilot can't see out the front during takeoff and landing. Time: 09:02 - 09:09 Instead, they've built a camera at the front that sends a live video feed to the pilot. But once in the air, this nose is key to reducing the sonic boom. I liken it to, you know, you've done a cannonball into a swimming pool. And what we wanna do here is that splash that you make is like the sonic boom. And we wanna make that splash or that sound as as small as possible. Then NASA wants to send as much of the remaining boom as possible up away from people. If you look at the bottom of the airplane, it's very, very smooth and clean. So that anything that would create a bump or anything like that that makes a shock that would go down, they're all on the top when they go up. And any remaining supersonic boom that's still going down, they're gonna try to cancel it out. When you jump into the pool doing that that cannonball, the biggest splash is when all the water comes back together. And so there is a big shock on the back end of the airplane. This feature, called the t tail, creates its own shock that interacts with that boom, canceling some of it out. By the way, I still can't believe that I got to see that plane up close. Like, normally, that is really not allowed. How many people have been allowed to do this close to this plane? Well, in the state that it's in right now, you're actually the first. Time: 09:10 - 10:13 I I'm gonna get fired, but but, yeah, you guys are are the first ones to come in the early season. You're not actually gonna get fired. No. But I already got yelled at. Oh, so there's no way I can sit? Nope. That seems fair. I could've pushed it enough. Time: 10:14 - 10:30 If NASA can help change the rule preventing supersonic overland, that can help everybody. It can open the floodgates to more companies and more planes. There are a bunch of private companies, including one called Boom, fighting to bring back these planes, and the pressure is on. It was very clear talking to this team that there's a lot on the line with this plane. You know, this takes a long time to develop, and there's a lot of money in in the development of it. And, you know, to see something from a concept drawn on a napkin to having the airplane here and then to to fly it. It is a lot of hard work. Really, this is our one opportunity to try to repeal the law. This is our one chance to get it right. So in order to change the rule that limits supersonic flight, they had to design the x 59 to have a sonic boom that's quiet enough to not disrupt everyday life. But how quiet is that exactly? The answer to that question is that no one exactly knows right now, and that's the entire reason why we had to build x 59 and why NASA plans on flying it over the next several years. NASA's anticipating that 75 perceived level decibels will be sufficiently quiet enough. So that's the goal that they're aiming for right now. The result of that is that it would sound kind of like your neighbor closing their car door in front of their house, but most of the time, you won't even hear it at all. This plane is just amazing. Every bolt, rivet, and tiny little winglet has been placed specifically to optimize aerodynamics and speed, all the way down to the paint. It has a very special anti static paint. So you know how you walk along and you get static from the carpet? Well, the carpet is like the air. As the airplane moves through the air, it generates static electricity on the airplane. So we have a special paint that's like putting Teflon on your shoes, you know, so that you don't build that static charge. But it's clear this is not a passenger plane. Yeah. We're not gonna build any more of these. This is a one off airplane. It's very dedicated to just this one demonstration to show that we can make an, an airplane that is capable of a low boom supersonic flight. So NASA's building their supersonic plane in the hopes that the breakthroughs that they make are one day gonna be able to be translated into commercial passenger supersonic planes that can carry more people. But when? When are you and I gonna get to fly in one? When is passenger supersonic flight finally coming back? Not soon enough in my book. But first, we'll go through the regulation process. That'll take a number of years to test this aircraft, then go to test the communities, and then go through the regulation process. So it looks like we're at least a decade away from seeing these planes, and claims from companies like Boom echo that. They've set a goal of bringing their planes to market by the end of this decade. But the industry seems so confident that this is gonna happen that three airlines have already placed orders for their supersonic Time: 10:30 - 12:57 planes. Eighty years ago, we set out on a journey to go faster than sound. Because Time: 12:58 - 13:02 as humans, we love going fast. We work so hard at it. We build these beautiful machines that hurdle us through the air. Just imagine flying on a machine like this. Time: 13:02 - 13:13 It's just so cool. But the promise of supersonic flight is much more than just being extremely cool. For all of history, being able to go farther faster has meant greater connection. When our world shrinks in size, it means that we, as humans, get to explore more of it. And today we have an opportunity to take another leap forward. It'll be our second try, but the good thing about that is we can fix what we know went wrong. Allowing supersonic flights over land is just step one. New supersonic planes need to be more sustainable. They can't guzzle fuel like they used to. They'll need to be cheaper. They'll need to be able to hold more than just one passenger. Time: 13:13 - 13:48 But we can do this. It's twenty years now since Concorde last flew, and I really do believe there will be another supersonic airliner offering supersonic travel to the general public in the not too distant future. The future is so bright, and it's so achievable. Like, I know that sounds like a cliche, but you can see it. That's really exciting. It really is. Huge if true. Huge if true. Huge and true. Time: 13:48 - 14:11 Okay. I wanna show you one more thing. My grandfather passed away a few years ago, and, I miss him a lot. And he actually worked for NASA in the nineteen sixties. And as we were going through his stuff, we found this pin of his. I've been keeping it close to me while I was researching this episode. And at the end of our visit to see this plane, Time: 14:15 - 14:32 NASA gave me this. Time: 14:33 - 14:35 And so now I have my own pin, and, Time: 14:37 - 14:39 it just really means a lot to me. So thanks for watching this episode, and thank you so much to NASA. If you like optimistic science and tech stories and you wanna support us in our show, the best thing that you can do is to subscribe. See you for the next one. Time: 14:40 - 14:52If NASA gets this right, I’m sure this video will blow up in a decade and if it does, it will be well deserved Cleo!",

      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:00 terrifying. Time: 00:03 - 00:03 But the maps that we have of our oceans Time: 00:04 - 00:06 are actually terrible. If you look at Google Maps, you might think that we know the precise topography of all of this, but that's a lie. We know less about the ocean floor than we do about the surface of Mars by a lot. How is that possible? We have mapped Mars to a resolution of five meters per pixel. For comparison, we've mapped the land on Earth to about 30 centimeters. But most of our oceans? Time: 00:08 - 00:28 1.5 Time: 00:29 - 00:29 kilometers, Time: 00:30 - 00:30 meaning 300 Time: 00:31 - 00:32 times less detail. Time: 00:32 - 00:33 And that's a big problem because we're using the ocean all the time. We're laying cables across it to carry your Internet traffic. We fight wars in it. We get food from it. We use it for global trade. 71% of Time: 00:34 - 00:44 of the Earth's surface is water, and yet we have a surprisingly limited view of what's below it. But hang on. We're smart. Why is that? Well, cartographically Time: 00:44 - 00:53 speaking, Time: 00:53 - 00:54 water sucks. For Mars or Earth's surface, we can take pictures, But light doesn't get to the ocean floor, so we need other ways to see it. And the good news is that we're developing that tech right now. There is a terrifying, incredible Time: 00:54 - 01:06 alien world right there on our own planet. And finally, Time: 01:06 - 01:09 we're using technology to see it more clearly. In this video, we're going deep with some help from a friend to show you how we're mapping the ocean, the surprising things that we've found in the depths, and why this new technology Time: 01:10 - 01:22 could be huge, if true. Map the ocean floor. Map the ocean floor. Map an ocean floor that nobody has ever met before. Pieced together a complete map of all the world's seabed. Oh my god. This one's freaking gorgeous. And nobody really knows quite what's Dalma. Dalma. Time: 01:22 - 01:39 Mapping our oceans is shockingly hard, largely because they're just so much deeper than most people think. Imagine that you walk off the coast into the water. At 10 meters or 33 feet deep, you're already experiencing an entire additional Time: 01:43 - 01:56 atmosphere of pressure on your body. At 214 Time: 01:56 - 01:59 meters, you're passing the verified record for a human diver with no equipment, and it's quickly getting darker and colder. At 828 Time: 01:59 - 02:06 meters, you're the depth of the tallest building on Earth, the Burj Khalifa. And a thousand meters down, the world is unrecognizable. Time: 02:06 - 02:12 No light from the surface can penetrate these depths. No light. Time: 02:13 - 02:16 The whole rest of the way is blackness, Time: 02:17 - 02:19 and you're less than 10% of the way down. A 220 Time: 02:19 - 02:22 meters, you're in the territory of the deepest military submarines that we know about. 3,800 Time: 02:22 - 02:27 meters, you hit the Titanic. Just above it is where we think the infamous ocean gate submersible imploded. The pressure down here, over 350 Time: 02:27 - 02:34 atmospheres, Time: 02:34 - 02:34 collapsed the faulty submersible in a thousandth of a second. For reference, in space, Time: 02:35 - 02:40 it would take you up to ninety seconds to die. So, I mean, if you ever have to choose between a few seconds in space or in the deep ocean, choose space. Except if you wanna see aliens, Time: 02:40 - 02:51 choose the ocean. Time: 02:51 - 02:52 It's so Time: 02:57 - 02:58 pretty. Time: 02:59 - 03:00 I just I love the ocean. The deepest recorded natural point is 10,935 Time: 03:03 - 03:09 meters or 6.8 Time: 03:09 - 03:12 miles deep. You might have heard of this spot, Challenger Deep. If you put Mount Everest into the water upside down, there would still be over a mile until you get to the bottom. It's roughly the average cruising altitude of a seven thirty seven airplane. Time: 03:12 - 03:24 The ocean is incredibly Time: 03:26 - 03:28 deep and scary and amazing, which, as you can imagine, makes it very hard to map. So we have over 70% of our Earth, most of which light can't penetrate and humans can't go. It's the last unknown place on Earth. Time: 03:28 - 03:41 When I look at Google Maps, I can see what looks like a topography of the entire ocean. But if we haven't mapped the ocean in detail, what am I actually looking at? We don't have good maps of the global seabed. What quite a lot of those maps have been derived from is using satellite gravity data. That's Steve Hall, marine scientist and ocean mapping expert. He told me that because light can't penetrate past a certain distance, satellites Time: 03:44 - 04:07 use a method that totally blows my mind and has changed how I'm gonna look at the ocean forever. Okay. Here it goes. The surface of the ocean isn't flat. It is ever so slightly Time: 04:07 - 04:18 the shape of what's below it. Time: 04:18 - 04:21 Yeah. The the gravitational field of the Earth isn't absolutely constant. So if there's a deep trench, there'll be ever such a slight dip down in the sea surface above it. If there's a mountain, there'll be ever such a tiny bulge. To create some of the topography that you see on Google Maps, we're using satellites to send radar pulses down to the surface of the Earth, measure the height of the water in different places, and then estimate the shape of the ocean floor. The next time that you look out across the water, just take a second to appreciate Time: 04:21 - 04:52 how absolutely bananas this is. But this radar on the ocean surface technique doesn't give us a very precise view of the seabed. We still need to fill in a lot of detail. You're looking at a pretty good approximation Time: 04:52 - 05:06 of what the shape of the seafloor is like, and a lot of that has been put together by good quality but educated guesswork. For example, see these bumps and ridges right here? We know that those are underwater mountains. But if you try and zoom in, it gets blurry. There's just not enough data to make a clear image. Luckily, we have other methods, some that were invented over a hundred years ago. In 1913, a German inventor created a device that could send acoustic waves into the water and record the time that it took for them to bounce bounce back. You've heard of this. This is sonar. But it wasn't until the nineteen forties that a woman named Marie Tharp turned those sonar measurements into maps. Those maps showed mountains and valleys and all kinds of things that we'd never seen before. They were some of, if not the first ocean floor maps ever created, but they've largely been forgotten by history. Time: 05:07 - 05:50 However, in researching this story, I discovered that rare physical copies of them exist at the Library of Congress in Washington, DC. Now I'm in New York, but I have a friend in DC, and he loves maps. Maps. On every map. With the map. This map. Like, you map it out. On a map. If you map in I collect a lot of maps. I asked my friend and fellow video journalist, Johnny Harris, to go find these old ocean maps so we could really see the progress that we've made. Time: 05:54 - 06:18 Hey. Hey. Listen. I have a favor to ask. Do you wanna go to the Library of Congress and look at some cool maps? Absolutely. Are you kidding? I will gladly take any excuse to go to the Library of Congress and stare at beautiful original maps. Time: 06:18 - 06:30 Oh, they're just like pure art. Time: 06:37 - 06:39 Oh my god. This one's freaking gorgeous. Time: 06:40 - 06:42 Okay. Come here. I wanna show you. You can imagine them out there on the ocean, hanging sound off the bottom of the ocean floor, and they just come back with this raw data. It's basically like a bunch of lines with numbers on them. Like it's super raw. Just telling them how deep each of these sections were. It's not a map though. Not yet. And you can see Marie Tharp just drawing with like a colored pencil to connect all of these lines to start to get an idea of the contours of the bottom of the ocean. So then she took that data and she connected the dots and created these, like, two d slices Time: 06:44 - 07:20 of land that are called profiles. And this is where you start to see it actually looks like mountains now. So then after the profiles, Time: 07:20 - 07:28 her and her research partner Bruce Heesen took these two d profiles and then they started to sketch by hand what parts of the ocean might look like. I mean this must have taken years. And then you do that with enough regions of the ocean, and finally you put them all together and you start to get like a real map. At first it was still pretty crude, like here's some of these early versions Time: 07:29 - 07:50 of what the ocean map looked like. This is one of the first, if not the first, published map of the ocean floor from 1957. Time: 07:50 - 07:59 This is one of the most beautiful maps I've ever seen. This one from 1977 Time: 07:59 - 08:04 is considered a work of art. I mean, look at it. Time: 08:04 - 08:07 As beautiful as all this is, a lot of this was, like, filling in the blanks, Time: 08:12 - 08:16 and that's a problem if you're trying to get a, like, hyper realistic Time: 08:16 - 08:21 map of the ocean. Time: 08:22 - 08:23 So they needed a better way. I just love these. Marie Tharpe's maps were so beautiful. But Time: 08:24 - 08:29 like Time: 08:29 - 08:30 Johnny showed, there were big parts that they had to essentially Time: 08:30 - 08:32 make up. Marie Tharp was using data from those narrow lines of sonar from old shipping routes. Today, we still use sonar to map the ocean floor, but instead of sending a few beams down, sonar devices send thousands in a fan that can span several kilometers. This is a really big deal because it makes it possible to map much larger areas at a time. You remember this blurry part of the map? Researchers just gathered sonar data for that part of the ocean, and now we can see it in much, much more detail. But we still haven't done that for most of the ocean, and we need to step it up, in part to better navigate the deep ocean to do things like lay Internet cables, but also to save lives by better predicting tsunamis and storms and sea level rise, or to use the ocean for new kinds of renewable energy, or because in a crisis, Time: 08:32 - 09:14 you really need a good map. You know, whole new mountain ranges and valleys and things were were discovered in the search for MH370 Time: 09:15 - 09:21 that never showed up on a map. People thought, well, it should be really obvious that there's a plane on the bottom because it must just be a flat boring surface. It turned out to be, you know, deep ravines and crags and mountain peaks where you can easily hide a Boeing trouble seven. Enter an international group of ocean avengers named Seabed twenty thirty. Seabed twenty thirty. Seabed twenty thirty. Seabed twenty thirty. The goal of Seabed twenty thirty is to map the entire ocean floor in detail by 2030. So instead of a resolution of 1.5 Time: 09:22 - 09:52 kilometers, they're trying to get even the most unknown areas mapped down to a resolution of 800 meters and higher traffic areas mapped down to only a few meters. Nobody's done this before. But Seabed 2030 is different in two key ways. First, they're getting data from new sources, basically everybody, from oil and gas companies to environmental groups to militaries Time: 09:52 - 10:13 with some caveats. The Russians are never gonna give us their high resolution map of the approaches to Murmansk Time: 10:14 - 10:19 Harbour and the Chinese aren't going to do the same with their approaches to Qingdao and we wouldn't expect them to. But what we would expect them to do, if they're able to say we're willing to let you have a map which is accurate to maybe a hundred meters, that's great. It's still giving us a much more detailed map than presently Time: 10:20 - 10:39 exists. Second, Seabed two thousand and thirty is getting data from the cutting edge ocean tech used by many of these groups. There's two exciting things at the moment. First of all, as I put it, the rise of the robots. Time: 10:39 - 10:49 It's an unmanned underwater robot. Autonomous underwater vehicle. Let's call it an underwater drone. Keep to explore underwater marine habitats. We call it mowing the lawn and you're going back and forth back and forth just trying to go up and taking those kind of measurements Time: 10:53 - 11:06 which is really really dull for a human crew to do but the robots are fine. You know you can go out to the robot and say, there's your patch of ocean. Go mow the lawn. And alongside the robots, Time: 11:06 - 11:16 AI. I'm looking forward to the the robots being smart enough to Time: 11:17 - 11:20 spot something interesting and investigate it to a higher level of accuracy. It's working. When the project started, we only had detailed maps for 6% of the ocean floor. Now, Time: 11:21 - 11:31 25%. Time: 11:31 - 11:32 Long way to go, but a lot of progress. Some people are worried about what we'll do with these maps. They think that better data might mean destruction if we find something valuable, like minerals to mine. But as Steve put it The lack of map is not the barrier to any of those people going out there and doing mining. You can't manage what you haven't measured. And a map, whether it's a map of the land or a map of the seabed, it kinda puts you all on the level playing field. Saying that we don't want information because we're afraid of what we'll do with it, that's not what helps people. It's our responsibility to use what we learn wisely. I think that we can't be afraid of knowledge for fear of what we'll do with it. Humanity's ability to map our environment has always been our first step to understanding it and hopefully using it for the better. Right now, we're exploring one of the last unknown places on our planet. That's awesome to be able to do together as a species. I think of it kind of like I think about the International Space Station. Countries at odds over all kinds of political ideologies Time: 11:32 - 12:31 working together for the sake of exploration Time: 12:32 - 12:34 and science. It's inspiring. Time: 12:34 - 12:36 The ocean is terrifying Time: 12:36 - 12:38 and beautiful and fucking immense. And we are these hairless monkeys incapable of diving by ourselves 1% of the way down who Time: 12:38 - 12:48 somehow, through our technology and our curiosity and our grit over hundreds of years, Time: 12:48 - 12:54 are finally now being able to see and be a part of a different world. I can't wait to see not just what it looks like and what we learn, but what we build with that knowledge to continue to push our world forward. That would be truly Time: 12:55 - 13:07 huge. Time: 13:07 - 13:08Pleeeeeease give me more excuses to go look at beautiful maps!! This was so fun thanks for looping me in ✨",

Time: 00:05 - 00:10 The atomic power plant of the future. Being developed by Argonne National Laboratory. But it's not just any old nuclear reactor. This reactor is different in many ways from the nuclear power plant that supplies some of our homes today with electricity. The biggest difference was the fuel they used to make electricity. Time: 00:10 - 00:26 This nuclear reactor made electricity Time: 00:26 - 00:28 out of nuclear waste. Nuclear waste. Nuclear waste. Some kind of nuclear waste. Well, firmware should be down to this batch. When I think of nuclear waste, I think of that classic Time: 00:29 - 00:38 glowing green goo in yellow barrels. You know? This radioactive stuff that we end up with with after all of the fuel is used up that we have to store for hundreds of thousands of years because it's so dangerous. Like, we fight about nuclear waste all the time. We say, can we even use nuclear because we end up with this radioactive waste? And where should we store it? And not near my house. And you're telling me that there's a nuclear reactor that can make electricity Time: 00:39 - 01:01 out of nuclear waste, and it was built in the nineteen sixties? Time: 01:02 - 01:05 Back then, they were predicting that we would use this technology to build this incredible clean energy future. And by the year February, Time: 01:06 - 01:12 more than half the electric power of the country will come from atomic sources. But today, we're nowhere close to that. We don't reuse any of our nuclear waste. Instead, it just piles up. But if this technology works, that means that our nuclear waste isn't radioactive trash. It's an incredible clean energy resource. Time: 01:13 - 01:31 And it's just sitting there sucking up money to keep it safe. We think about technology as constantly moving forward. Time: 01:31 - 01:38 But this is a story about how we left behind a technology that could change our energy future. So this video is about what happened to using nuclear waste to make electricity, Time: 01:38 - 01:49 to the clean energy future that we could have had. But more importantly, this video is about the people trying to bring that future Time: 01:49 - 01:56 back. Nuclear waste. Nuclear waste problem. The concern about nuclear energy. There are concerns about emissions. Abundant power. We need clean energy. Energizes the city. We are coming up with new nuclear reactors Time: 01:56 - 02:08 guarantee a plentiful supply of atomic power for the nation and the world for centuries to come. Time: 02:08 - 02:14 Come. Time: 02:15 - 02:15 I first got obsessed with this topic because a couple of weeks ago, my friend and fellow video journalist Johnny Harris called me up, and he asked me for some help on a video that he was making all about nuclear power. Let's do this. I'm going to go down the rabbit hole on why people are afraid of nuclear energy. What are the events and the things that freak us all out? And I kind of want you to do the opposite. Time: 02:20 - 02:40 To look at, like, is there a future for this technology and should we actually be as afraid as we are? So I started to dig into it. And as part of my research process into nuclear power, I got invited to go visit one of the largest and oldest national research centers in The United States. Time: 02:41 - 02:56 Here we are. This is Argonne National Laboratory. We're gonna get to go see research that they're doing, and they have been doing research on nuclear power since, like, before I was born. Hold on. Do you recognize that name? Argonne National Laboratory. Yeah. This is the same national lab that developed that incredible old nuclear waste recycling reactor, but I didn't know that yet. So we go on this incredible tour. It's awesome. I'm learning a ton. I'm thinking, oh my god. I'm gonna be so overprepared to talk to Johnny about nuclear power. And on this tour with me are these two people from Oklo, which is a company that's working on new kinds of nuclear reactors. And at the end of the tour, I'm sitting with them under this Time: 02:56 - 03:28 big tree, and one of them says something that just short circuits my brain. So we're actually working with Arbonne closely on how to recycle existing Time: 03:28 - 03:36 nuclear waste in The US. There is enough used fuel to power the country for the next hundred and fifty years. Time: 03:37 - 03:43 Wait. I'm sorry. What? There is enough used fuel in the country, in The US alone, Time: 03:44 - 03:50 to generate power for the country for the next one hundred and fifty years. There's enough used fuel, meaning nuclear waste, Time: 03:50 - 03:57 in The US to power the country for a hundred and fifty years. Like, you can see me not believing her. I think it's some fake math. Like, maybe, technically, there's enough energy there, but, like, we can never really use it. We don't know how to do that. Where is, like, when they say, you know, geothermal, you could power the Earth for, like, thousands of years if we could get all of the energy out of the Earth? It's like, yeah. We can't. We don't know how to do that. Do we know how to yeah. We just don't have the facility, commercial facility to do so, but the technology is there. Experts differ on the exact number of years here, but they agree that the nuclear waste we have now could be used as a large energy source based on technology that we've already built. But it gets even better. If you reuse that nuclear waste, especially if you reuse it more than once, you can dramatically cut down on the amount of time that the waste after all of that's done is radioactive for. So the amount of time that we have to store our nuclear waste. The problems are cost and global politics, Time: 03:58 - 04:52 not fundamental technology. Time: 04:53 - 04:54 Here we are. Time: 04:55 - 04:56 By the time I got to DC to talk to Johnny about this, I was Time: 04:56 - 04:59 obsessed. Time: 05:00 - 05:00 Hello. Hello, Courtney. Welcome to our studio. We have all of this nuclear waste. Right? And it is scary. But imagine that there was a way that you could actually not just store it, but actually use it. So you can use nuclear waste as fuel for more energy. Recycle nuclear waste. You can recycle nuclear waste. Yes. And I typed all the way into this in a video that I'm now gonna promise is gonna be on my channel by the time we air this one. This is that video. To understand what's going on here, you you have to understand that nuclear waste isn't what you've been told. Alright. Let's zoom out for a sec. Basically, all of the electricity that you use, except solar, comes from spinning a turbine. It's magic. Most of the time inside a power plant, what you're really doing is you're heating up a liquid into steam and using that to spin the turbine. The most common way to do that is still burning stuff near it. That's fossil fuels. But you could also use liquid that the Earth already heated up for you. That's geothermal. Or you can split atoms apart inside special rocks and make them really hot. That's nuclear. And the special hot rocks are uranium. Uranium with Uranium two thirty five. Uranium. Sleep two. Uranium. Time: 05:01 - 06:06 Fever. But only a really small part of natural uranium, less than 1%, is a kind of breakable uranium that can sustain a nuclear reaction. This is uranium two thirty five. The number refers to the number of neutrons in the atom. So typically, uranium goes through a process called enrichment, which is making more of the uranium two thirty five out of the less useful uranium two thirty eight. By the time that's all done, your fuel looks like this. If you take your finger up to your first joint, that's about the size of a uranium fuel pellet. Those pellets then go into these long metal rods that I got to see while I was at Argonne. And then comes the nuclear reaction. So you fire a bunch of free atoms at your uranium two thirty five, which cracks it into smaller, very unstable atoms and throws off a couple other neutrons in the process, which zoom off and hit more uranium nearby and then more and more, a chain reaction of splitting atoms. And each time they get split, a little mass turns into energy, which makes the rods really hot, which heats the water, which spins the turbine, which generates electricity. Time: 06:06 - 07:03 Ta da. But eventually, after four to six years, you've broken enough of that special uranium that the reaction stops working efficiently. And that spent fuel is now considered high level nuclear waste. At this point, that waste is a mix of two thirty eight and a little bit of leftover two thirty five and a bunch of very unstable atoms that give off ionizing radiation. Time: 07:04 - 07:22 That ionizing radiation in large doses is the bad stuff. It's the scary invisible killer that affects our tissues and our DNA in often deadly ways. And the thing is, this nuclear waste stays radioactive Time: 07:23 - 07:34 for an insanely Time: 07:35 - 07:36 long time. We're talking Time: 07:36 - 07:37 hundreds of thousands of years sometimes, which is, to put it mildly, Time: 07:38 - 07:42 a problem. We've got to find better and safer ways to store store nuclear waste. Waste that can remain radioactive for centuries, that remains a big problem. Right now, most nuclear waste in The United States is stored in dry casks that look like this to protect people from the radioactive material inside. Those dry casks are meant to last decades, but not hundreds of thousands of years, which is what we're talking about here. So we've been having this ongoing fight for decades about what to do with nuclear waste. There are options for long term storage, and some countries are already doing that. Johnny and I got into the details in his video. But right now, in The US and in lots of other countries, there are a lot of dry casks full of nuclear waste just sitting there at nuclear power plants. So to summarize, we take uranium out of the ground, we use it once, and then we store it basically forever. This is the once through fuel cycle that The US has today. Now listen to the analogy that they used in the nineteen sixties to describe how Time: 07:43 - 08:34 stupid Time: 08:34 - 08:35 this fuel cycle would be. Would you say that using the two thirty five and not the rest is sort of like using the cream and throwing away the milk? Exactly. The key is to figure out how to filter out the stuff that's still useful from the real waste that's not. Turns out, Argonne is one of the few places that is still testing nuclear waste recycling in The US, and I got to go see it. I'm just gonna go right on up, and they're gonna tell me to stop filming right Time: 08:35 - 08:59 now. It was a whole thing. I had to send them my passport to prove that I was a US citizen before they'd let me on the tour, and I wasn't allowed to film inside. In order to go into this place that I can't show you, I have to wear these cool safety glasses. Time: 09:00 - 09:11 How do I look? Amazing. Time: 09:13 - 09:14 Let's do it. Luckily, Argonne itself has actually published footage from the lab that I toured. So here's what they're doing inside that large protective box. First, they cut up the nuclear waste into little pieces. Then they dissolve those pieces into a vat of molten salts. When they run electricity through that vat, it separates the uranium and other useful materials from the rest of the junk and pushes it across the vat where it creates deposits of the useful stuff on the other side. Then they make new fuel rods out of those deposits and stick them back in a reactor. And it's not just possible to do that once, you can do it multiple times. Not just making electricity, but also reducing how long that waste is radioactive for because you're using off the materials that last the longest. Time: 09:15 - 09:53 From hundreds of thousands of years down sometimes to hundreds of years, which is a much easier time frame to store something. If you can pull this off, you can have a nuclear fuel cycle that looks like this. You mine the uranium, you use it in a reactor, filter out the useful stuff, then you use it again and maybe again and again. And when you can't anymore, then you put it in much shorter term storage that's much more manageable. This is called a closed fuel cycle and there are lots of variations, but it's not hypothetical. Time: 09:54 - 10:18 Some countries like Japan for example are already doing this and they say they do it because it reduces their dependence on imported fuel, it conserves uranium, and it reduces the radioactivity of their nuclear waste, which makes sense. So Time: 10:19 - 10:30 what happened in The United States? Tonight, I wanna have an unpleasant talk with you. In 1977, Time: 10:32 - 10:38 President Jimmy Carter announced new policies meant to stop the growing risk of nuclear war, and that meant stopping all nuclear Time: 10:38 - 10:44 recycling. Why? Well, you remember the materials that we separated out during the recycling process. One of those materials was plutonium, which is a highly radioactive element that was seen as the highest concern for nuclear proliferation. So president Jimmy Carter stopped all nuclear recycling saying, quote, a viable and economic nuclear power program can be sustained without such reprocessing and recycling. The US moved away from the kinds of reactors that could handle nuclear waste called fast reactors and toward the kinds of reactors that exist today called called light water reactors. But while The US stopped nuclear recycling, other countries didn't. The ban on nuclear recycling stopped being seen as helpful to slow the threat of nuclear proliferation. So president Reagan lifted the ban in 1981. Time: 10:45 - 11:24 But by then, companies had invested in the kinds of reactors that couldn't recycle, the kind that we have now. Today, the main claim is that nuclear fuel recycling is too high cost. It's just not economical. Time: 11:24 - 11:34 And that's true compared to using new uranium, which has been cheap and plentiful. What incentive did anyone have to recycle their fuel? But those incentives are changing. The combination of wondering whether global conflict will cut off fuel supply and the recognition that we need more clean energy in as many ways as possible as fast as possible has started to wake people up through technology and a dream that we left behind. We are not far off from it. We're not talking about a technology that we're dreaming of, that we hope can work. We're talking about technology that has already been demonstrated before and proven. We just need to commercialize it. There is a lot to figure out and a long way to go. But if we can recycle nuclear waste, I think it says something profound about what we as humans are capable of. Splitting atoms, sure. But I mean something much more simple. Changing our minds and overcoming our fears. To use our resources and our technology and our ingenuity to make other people's lives a little bit better tomorrow Time: 11:35 - 12:32 than they are today. And this of course is just the beginning. Not only will atomic power be released, but someday we will harness the rise and fall of the tides and and imprison the rays of the sun. We have indeed just begun. Time: 12:32 - 12:45 Huge of True is an optimistic show about using technology technology to make the world better. If that's something that you believe in, the best thing that you can do to support us is to subscribe. And if you do subscribe, let me know. I'd love to meet you in the comments. See you for the next one. Time: 12:50 - 13:03After over 30 years in the nuclear (government) industry, I would say we never met an engineering challenge we couldn't solve, but had a very poor record of overcoming political challenges.",

The plutonium was the excuse used to shut down\nthe U.S. reprocessing efforts, but it really isn't very good for making nuclear\nweapons with. Basically, if you want \"weapons grade\" plutonium, you want to\n\"cook\" the fuel for a short time; days or weeks, depending on things. When fuel\nis in the reactor for years, the plutonium will have too much of the wrong\nisotopes. So, when you get down to it, our reprocessing program was shut down\nbecause of several lies.\n2.
