      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:10 (gunshot fires) - [Johnny] There's a cover-up that's about to happen here. - [Newsman] This is a situation and I read, \"Kennedy is shot in head.\" Time: 00:10 - 00:20 - [Johnny] The assassination of a president and then a scramble by the U.S. government to hide information from its people. - So much information was hid from the American public. Time: 00:20 - 00:30 - [Lyndon] How many, how many, how many shots were fired? - [J. Edgar] Three. - [Johnny] The question of who shot JFK and why has riveted America since that horrifying day 60 years ago. Time: 00:30 - 00:40 But over time, it's become clear that the FBI and CIA kept information hidden, not just from the public, but from the commission Time: 00:40 - 00:50 in charge of investigating the assassination. This has fueled an understandable doubt in the official account, including, by the way, Lyndon B. Johnson, the president who took JFK's place. Time: 00:50 - 01:00 Congress even came out in the '80s saying that this was probably a conspiracy, and the public ran wild with this. They came up with hundreds of suspects Time: 01:00 - 01:10 of who could have been involved in the assassination. Theories like this thrive when government authorities aren't transparent with their people. Time: 01:10 - 01:20 So let me show you how this happened. Let me explain the official story and why that story has been hit with a wave of doubt over the decades Time: 01:20 - 01:30 and explain that unlike a lot of conspiracy theories, doubting the official story here isn't as crazy as you might think. (tense dramatic music) Time: 01:30 - 01:40 - [Journalist] This was a turning point in American history. Time: 01:40 - 01:50 People all of a sudden decided, \"I'm not sure they're telling us the truth.\" Time: 01:50 - 02:00 People loved John Kennedy. He was this good-looking guy who was always hanging out with his beautiful family and he just seemed to instill a sense of confidence Time: 02:00 - 02:10 in people. Kennedy rode this positive perception up the ranks of American politics to become the 35th president. This was in the early '60s when America was in a giant time of transition. Time: 02:10 - 02:20 - Oh, this is a revolution, of course, that is sweeping our country now. - The U.S. was the global superpower and was locked in a Cold War with another empire a world away. Time: 02:20 - 02:30 So JFK walks into the presidency to find his military and intelligence leaders causing a lot of trouble around the world. They had become very comfortable with dangerous secrets. Time: 02:30 - 02:40 They were funding wars, they were overthrowing governments in faraway countries, they were assassinating leaders that threatened American interests, Time: 02:40 - 02:50 and they were doing most of this totally in secret. By the way, if you wanna know more about those CIA shenanigans, go watch the video where we map all the U.S. coups. Anyway, JFK walks in and sees this as \"too much.\" Time: 02:50 - 03:00 He wants to reign in these spy and military leaders from what he sees as an abuse of American power. He ended up firing and demoting a bunch of these leaders, a lot of these intel and military guys Time: 03:00 - 03:10 who were plotting and executing covert operations around the world, and he continued to pursue like his ideal of world peace. He chose diplomacy over violence. When nuclear-armed missiles were found in Cuba, Time: 03:10 - 03:20 he slowed down the momentum towards a full-scale presence in Vietnam and he shut down several of these covert operations that were being planned by the leaders around him. Time: 03:20 - 03:30 This caused great tension between JFK and America's military and spy leadership. All of this context is important when we look back on that day in November 1963. Time: 03:30 - 03:40 - [Newsman] Friday morning, 11:37, the President's jet lands at the Dallas Airport. (typewriter keyboard clacking) (tense suspenseful music) Time: 03:40 - 03:50 - [Johnny] President Kennedy and the Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson arrived to Dallas for a speech that the President was to give. Time: 03:50 - 04:00 He got in this open-top limousine with his wife, Jackie, and the Texas governor, John Connally, along with his wife, Nellie. Time: 04:00 - 04:10 They rode through these streets, downtown Dallas lined with cheering spectators, and then gunshots rang out. Time: 04:10 - 04:20 (gunshot fires) - [Newsman] Kennedy apparently shot in head. Blood was on his head. - [Johnny] The shots hit the President in the neck and head, also wounding Governor Connally. Time: 04:20 - 04:30 The President was rushed to the hospital where he was pronounced dead. - And very often, you'll find a zipper hidden in the arm. Time: 04:30 - 04:40 - Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. You'll excuse the fact that I'm out of breath, Time: 04:40 - 04:50 but President Kennedy and Governor John Connally have been cut down by assassins' bullets in downtown Dallas. The President has rushed to Parkland Hospital. (tense suspenseful music) Time: 04:50 - 05:00 (tense suspenseful music) (typewriter keyboard clacking) - [Johnny] Within hours of the assassination, the prime suspect became this 24-year-old former Marine, Time: 05:00 - 05:10 a self-declared communist who had renounced his American citizenship and moved to the Soviet Union, where he then fell disenchanted with life in Russia Time: 05:10 - 05:20 and move back to the U.S. Eventually, ending up on the sixth story of this building in Dallas where he worked and where he was on that morning in November where he aimed a rifle and shot the President. Time: 05:20 - 05:30 His name was Lee Harvey Oswald. And after these shots rang out, he fled. While on the run, he shot and killed a Dallas police officer before hiding in a movie theater Time: 05:30 - 05:40 and then eventually being arrested at around 2:15 PM that day. - I didn't shoot anybody, no, Sir. - There was to be a trial, and Oswald planned to plead not guilty, Time: 05:40 - 05:50 claiming the whole thing was actually a setup. - I'm just a patsy. - Patsy, which is like an old-timey term for like the fall guy, the one who was setup. Time: 05:50 - 06:00 That same day, the vice president, Lyndon B. Johnson, was rushed back to the presidential plane and sworn in as the new president of the United States before taking off and heading back to Washington. Time: 06:00 - 06:10 At the same time, the FBI, the top investigatory body in our country, descends onto Dallas. And very quickly, the director of the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover, Time: 06:10 - 06:20 who's a big part of the story, he comes to a conclusion as to what happened. This is before any investigation had really gone forth. And Hoover decides that Oswald absolutely was the one who did it. Time: 06:20 - 06:30 He was a communist sympathizer, he was a frustrated misfit, and crucially, he acted alone. There was no one else. Here's a phone call between Hoover and the new president, LBJ. Time: 06:30 - 06:40 - [J. Edgar] There's no question but that he is the man now. The fingerprints and things we have. - I'd like some legal representation, but you, police officers, have not allowed me to have any. Time: 06:40 - 06:50 - But luckily, we have a justice system and we would find what the facts actually say. Oswald was going to stand trial where the evidence could be thoroughly examined, Time: 06:50 - 07:00 where the country could see for themselves who actually shot their President and get closure on this horrifying event, where whoever did it could actually be brought to justice. Time: 07:00 - 07:10 But that never happened. Two days after the assassination, while Oswald was being transferred from police headquarters to the county jail, a nightclub owner named Jack Ruby Time: 07:10 - 07:20 jumped out in front of the crowd of police officers and news reporters and shot Oswald. (gunshot fires) He was quickly rushed to the hospital Time: 07:20 - 07:30 where he died soon after, the same hospital where President Kennedy had died just 48 hours earlier. - Lee Oswald has been shot. - I think he got what he deserved, if he's the one that did it. Time: 07:30 - 07:40 - It is difficult to say how long it will take for the full realization of what happened to really sink in. - With Oswald dead, there could be no trial, no real sense of justice. Time: 07:40 - 07:50 This left the government investigators, the FBI mostly, with the opportunity to really own the narrative of what happened. The very next day, the Deputy Attorney General sends a memo to the White House Time: 07:50 - 08:00 stressing that the public must be satisfied with this explanation that Oswald acted alone. He didn't have co-conspirators that were still at large. Time: 08:00 - 08:10 This had to be the story, and I'll explain why in a sec. This memo also included some wisdom and kind of a foreshadow of what was gonna happen over the next several decades Time: 08:10 - 08:20 where the memo urges the White House to release as much information as possible to the public so as to avoid public speculation. Just remember that advice, Time: 08:20 - 08:30 \"Release the information to avoid public speculation.\" It's kinda the most important part of the story. We have these recently released phone recordings between the FBI director, J. Edgar Hoover, Time: 08:30 - 08:40 and the new president, LBJ, and we see in this phone call that the FBI actually didn't want a thorough investigation. - [Lyndon] I think it would be very, very bad Time: 08:40 - 08:50 to have a rash of investigations. - [J. Edgar] It'd be a three-ring circus. - [Lyndon] Well, the only way to stop them is probably to appoint a high level one to evaluate your report. I can select out of the government, Time: 08:50 - 09:00 and I could tell the House and Senate not to go ahead with the investigation. - [J. Edgar] Yes. - LBJ creates this group called the Warren Commission, Time: 09:00 - 09:10 and you can see in these phone calls, he was asking the FBI director who should be on the Commission. - [Lyndon] What do you think about Allen Dulles? - [J. Edgar] I think he would be a good man. Time: 09:10 - 09:20 - [Johnny] Wait, did you catch that? Allen Dulles, he was the former director of the CIA. He's one of the guys that JFK fired after he tried to overthrow the Cuban government. And now, he's about to be appointed to the committee Time: 09:20 - 09:30 investigating Kennedy's assassination. This did nothing to instill trust in the Commission. - The new president appointed a Commission of seven prominent Americans Time: 09:30 - 09:40 to investigate the whole affair. - [Lyndon] The Special Commission will have before it all the evidence uncovered by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and all the information available to any agencies of the Federal Government. Time: 09:40 - 09:50 - The Warren Commission was given just 10 months to investigate this situation using the evidence that was mostly provided to them by the FBI. They produced this report, Time: 09:50 - 10:00 which essentially confirms the conclusion that J. Edgar Hoover, the director of the FBI, had come to in the hours and days following the assassination, that on November 22nd, Time: 10:00 - 10:10 the shots fired that killed the President and wounded the Governor were fired by one guy, Lee Harvey Oswald. The report stresses that he acted alone. They say it very definitively. Time: 10:10 - 10:20 He nor the person who killed him two days later, Jack Ruby, were a part of any conspiracy, domestic or foreign. All of the shots came solely Time: 10:20 - 10:30 from the sixth floor of this building, and crucially, there were only three shots fired. Three bullets. - [Lyndon] How many, how many, how many shots were fired? - [J. Edgar] Three. Time: 10:30 - 10:40 - [Lyndon] Any of them fired at me? - [J. Edgar] No. - [Lyndon] All three to the President? - [J. Edgar] All three to the President, and we have them. - [Johnny] The report says that the first bullet Time: 10:40 - 10:50 likely missed the car completely, but that the second one did something very interesting. It first hit the president in the back Time: 10:50 - 11:00 and then exited his chest. It then entered through the governor's back, went through his rib, and then exited through his chest, but it wasn't done yet. It then entered his wrist, shattering the wrist bone, Time: 11:00 - 11:10 and then exited the wrist and went partially into the governor's leg. Whoa, okay. It's quite the journey for one bullet. Time: 11:10 - 11:20 Oh, and the bullet in question, which just apparently made seven wounds, supposedly looked like this, which some ballistic experts have said looks a little too pristine for a bullet Time: 11:20 - 11:30 that allegedly just went through two human bodies. And then, of course, the third bullet, according to the Warren Commission, was the one that delivered the fatal headshot to the President. This was the explanation that the Warren Commission Time: 11:30 - 11:40 came up with to explain all of the wounds that were found on the victims. All of this damage had to be done with just three bullets, and why just three bullets? Time: 11:40 - 11:50 Again, ask J. Edgar Hoover right after the assassination. - [J. Edgar] On that floor, we found the three empty shells that had been fired. - They only found three shells up on that sixth floor. Time: 11:50 - 12:00 So if all of this damage was done with more than three bullets, that would mean that there had to be more than one shooter. A conspiracy. Time: 12:00 - 12:10 But there couldn't be a conspiracy. Hoover had adopted this line of thinking right after the assassination, this assumption that it was just one guy, and that line of thinking endured into the Warren Commission, Time: 12:10 - 12:20 a commission that Hoover himself helped the President assemble. In the end, the Commission used a lot of cherry-picked evidence provided to them by the FBI Time: 12:20 - 12:30 that supported their already-drawn conclusions. And in the process, they turned any focus away from exploring all of the possibilities, Time: 12:30 - 12:40 including the possibility of a conspiracy. The report focuses almost entirely on one guy, Lee Harvey Oswald, and his three bullets. - Who killed John F. Kennedy? Time: 12:40 - 12:50 The Commission answers unequivocally, \"Lee Harvey Oswald.\" Was Oswald a member of a conspiracy? The Commission answers, \"He acted alone.\" Time: 12:50 - 13:00 - They ignored witnesses that contradicted their stories. They ignored or modified the signed reports from surgeons and doctors who worked with President Kennedy immediately after he arrived to the hospital Time: 13:00 - 13:10 that said that the wounds in the President's neck-chest area looked like they came in from the front, meaning not from this building that was behind the President. In other words, the FBI and the Warren Commission Time: 13:10 - 13:20 ignored the advice from that memo that admonished the government to release all of the facts. In my mind, this was the biggest mistake Time: 13:20 - 13:30 and the root of all the conspiracy theories that exists today. The question I had in all of this is, why? Why not do a proper investigation that explores the possibility that this was done Time: 13:30 - 13:40 by a group of conspirators instead of just one guy? For me, the answer to this question has a lot to do with the greatest fears that the American government and people were facing Time: 13:40 - 13:50 in the early 1960s. (tense suspenseful music) (typewriter keyboard clacking) First, we have to remember that 1960s America Time: 13:50 - 14:00 was right in the heart of the Cold War, a time of constant vigilance of fear of nuclear apocalypse, of extreme tension between these two superpowers. Time: 14:00 - 14:10 If this assassination was seen as an attempt to topple the government. Or even worse, if it had been organized by the Soviet Union or its fellow communist regime in Cuba, Time: 14:10 - 14:20 that would create a sense of panic among the American public. It would be a very different situation than a 24-year-old communist sympathizer acting alone. Time: 14:20 - 14:30 A believed conspiracy would also create pressure from the American public to strike back, which could lead to an escalation with another nuclear-armed nation. Oh, and the CIA also had an incentive Time: 14:30 - 14:40 to keep an investigation from being too widespread. At the time, they were secretly conducting all of these operations to assassinate Cuba's leader, Fidel Castro. Time: 14:40 - 14:50 This was a big deal and it was a big secret at the time. Any deep investigation into possible conspiracy with Cuba might reveal that the CIA is trying to assassinate Fidel Castro, Time: 14:50 - 15:00 which would not be good for the CIA. So one way to read all of this, the memos, the rushed conclusion, the emphasis on Oswald acting alone, the need for there to only be three bullets, Time: 15:00 - 15:10 you can see this as a bunch of government officials scrambling to keep the American public calm to make sure that pandemonium doesn't break out all while reducing the possibility Time: 15:10 - 15:20 of geopolitical escalation with the Soviet Union. You can see this in some of these phone calls where the new president is deeply worried about keeping the American people united Time: 15:20 - 15:30 around a simplified narrative of what happened. He's worried that if alternative theories get out, it could threaten our entire system. So their tactic for doing this was to hijack the narrative Time: 15:30 - 15:40 to suppress and influence the investigation and make it very simple, Oswald did it. That's it. Here's the problem though. Eventually, people will do the math Time: 15:40 - 15:50 and realize that the government has been keeping the full picture from them, and that's exactly what happens next. (tense suspenseful music) (typewriter keyboard clacking) Time: 15:50 - 16:00 So the Warren Commission files its report with the official story of what happened, but soon after they do so, Time: 16:00 - 16:10 members of the Warren Commission themselves come out and say like they don't actually believe the story that the Warren Commission just put out, especially when it comes to the key assertion that one bullet was responsible for causing seven wounds. Time: 16:10 - 16:20 - I could not convince myself that the same bullet struck both of them. - [Interviewer] You mean that you, yourself, weren't convinced about the single-bullet theory? Time: 16:20 - 16:30 - No, I wasn't convinced. - [Johnny] Governor Connally, the one who was sitting in front of JFK and the one who was supposedly shot by that one single bullet, he disagreed with the story. Time: 16:30 - 16:40 - I understand there's some question in the minds of the experts about whether or not we could both have been hit by the same bullet. I just don't happen to believe that. - Even the new president, LBJ, wasn't totally convinced. Time: 16:40 - 16:50 I mean, he was kind of secretive about it, but he eventually did come out and tell a reporter from the Atlantic that he thought that this was a conspiracy, that it was Cuba retaliating against the U.S. for all of these CIA attempts to assassinate their leader. Time: 16:50 - 17:00 This was not good for the Warren Commission and their story. Then, 12 years after the assassination, this full uncut version of a strip of film Time: 17:00 - 17:10 that shows the assassination of JFK, it finally airs on national TV. - It's the film shot by the Dallas dress manufacturer, Time: 17:10 - 17:20 Abraham Zapruder, and it's the execution of President Kennedy. Time: 17:20 - 17:30 - This was the first time that Americans could see solid visual evidence of this event, but why hadn't it been released earlier? To some, this film contradicted the official account from the Warren Commission Time: 17:30 - 17:40 and it sparked this new demand for real answers from a government that kept behaving like it was hiding something. All of this is coinciding with a time in American history Time: 17:40 - 17:50 where Americans are losing faith in the Federal Government. You just see this massive like nosedive. All of the CIA's covert operations are starting to come to light, Time: 17:50 - 18:00 the country is mired in this endless war in Vietnam, the President's people were just found spying on their political opponents in a hotel in D.C. Like, the government has not earned our trust at this point, Time: 18:00 - 18:10 so people are like, \"It wouldn't be a far stretch that the government was also behind the assassination of JFK.\" This was furthered by the suspicious assassination Time: 18:10 - 18:20 of Martin Luther King, Jr. - Dr. Martin Luther King, the apostle of non-violence in the Civil Rights Movement has been shot to death in Memphis, Tennessee. Time: 18:20 - 18:30 - This was all too much and the people wanted answers. So in a shining moment of redemption of our democracy, Congress responded by forming a committee that reopened the investigations into these Time: 18:30 - 18:40 two assassinations, JFK and MLK. This committee did a real investigation. They actually were earnest about this and they confirmed what a lot of Americans were already feeling, which is that the Warren Commission's investigation Time: 18:40 - 18:50 didn't sufficiently look into the possibilities of a conspiracy. They say it point blank. They were way too fixated on their assumptions that it had to be this lone gunman that did it Time: 18:50 - 19:00 and that their conclusions were way too definitive, and then they specifically call out the FBI and the CIA for withholding information from the investigation. One FBI agent even testified that he was ordered Time: 19:00 - 19:10 by his superiors to destroy evidence. In this case, a letter that Oswald had written to the FBI. - And he handed it to me and he said, \"Oswald's dead now. Time: 19:10 - 19:20 There can be no trial. Here, get rid of this.\" - Why was the FBI asking its agents to destroy evidence? The committee concluded that it was a \"high probability Time: 19:20 - 19:30 that it was two gunmen that fired at JFK and that it was probably a conspiracy.\" That's what it says. But they stopped short of trying to determine Time: 19:30 - 19:40 who that other gunman was or who had organized the conspiracy. And then they once again make the recommendation that all of the information on this topic be made public. - Isn't it time for the American people Time: 19:40 - 19:50 to, at least, know what happened at 12:30 PM in Dallas, Texas on November 22nd, 1963? - Quick caveat, the committee's conclusion Time: 19:50 - 20:00 that the assassination was probably a conspiracy relied heavily on one piece of evidence, which was the sound recording from that day where you can hear gunshots and you hear more than three, Time: 20:00 - 20:10 and it kind of inferred that there were like multiple shooters. This evidence was later challenged and kind of debunked by the FBI, but also a different research facility that basically said, Time: 20:10 - 20:20 \"This sound recording wasn't even gunshots. It wasn't even recorded during the time of the assassination.\" But to me, the whole conspiracy thing was not actually Time: 20:20 - 20:30 the most important part of this committee's report. The most important part was that they confirmed that the Warren Commission had been cherry-picking evidence and hiding stuff from the American people. Time: 20:30 - 20:40 After the Congressional Committee confirmed to the American people that the FBI and the CIA had been hiding evidence, the conspiracy theories rose up once again culminating in this movie in the early '90s Time: 20:40 - 20:50 that paints an alternative picture of what could have happened here, a shadowy government conspiracy to kill the President, or at least a conspiracy to cover up the real story. Time: 20:50 - 21:00 - Oswald, Ruby, Cuba, the mafia, keeps them guessing like some kind of parlor game, prevents them from asking the most important question, why? Time: 21:00 - 21:10 Why was Kennedy killed? Who benefited? Who has the power to cover it up? - The film was largely conjecture, Time: 21:10 - 21:20 kind of based on some elements of truth, and some might argue that it was irresponsibly misleading to, like, show the American public like, \"Hey, the government killed the President.\" But hey, in a world where the government isn't being clear Time: 21:20 - 21:30 and forthright to the American people, this film felt like a response. Maybe the government was hiding the truth, maybe the government did do it, or maybe they're just covering something up. Time: 21:30 - 21:40 We don't know because they haven't released information. This was a popular movie and people latched onto the theories presented in this film. - The notion that there were more than one set of shooters Time: 21:40 - 21:50 the way that it's presented physically in this movie is highly convincing. - Public pressure got so intense that Congress finally decided to do what they should have done in the '60s, Time: 21:50 - 22:00 which is force all of these agencies to release all of the information. So in 1992, Congress passes this law that would lay the foundation for releasing Time: 22:00 - 22:10 all of the documents related to the assassination by October 2017. That was the deadline. They assembled a committee and gave them several years to go through all of the documents Time: 22:10 - 22:20 and reexamine the official account and prepare these documents for release to the public. We actually talked to the chairman of that committee. - I was nominated by President Clinton to chair the Assassination Records Review Board. Time: 22:20 - 22:30 - In the process of going over all of this documentation, this review board found some more inconsistencies and discrepancies and instances of potential cover-up, Time: 22:30 - 22:40 like the autopsy. There's an entire video I could make about just the autopsy and the missing brain and all of this, but the crux of it is that what the doctors and surgeons saw Time: 22:40 - 22:50 moments after the President was shot. They recorded and they, like, wrote down, but then what the official autopsy record actually looked like when it was released Time: 22:50 - 23:00 was something very different. The way the wounds were described, where the wounds were, what the brain looked like, all of this stuff had been changed or modified. Time: 23:00 - 23:10 The photos themselves had potentially been changed, and then the brain itself like literally went missing. It's like unaccounted for. So anyway, that's an entire rabbit hole Time: 23:10 - 23:20 that you can go down if you want to. Releasing all these records also revealed that the CIA and FBI had been keeping tabs on Oswald's whereabouts, which maybe makes sense Time: 23:20 - 23:30 because he was like a Soviet sympathizer, but like, why didn't we know that before? We learned that the Secret Service had destroyed documents, the original motorcade route sheets that they had, Time: 23:30 - 23:40 the surveillance tapes from that day. They had destroyed them. - Now, we found those documents in the hands of another agency, so ultimately there was no harm. - Judge Tunheim said that, yes, they got a lot of documents, Time: 23:40 - 23:50 but a lot of stuff was still missing. Like, there was one guy at the CIA who took control of the investigation a couple weeks after the assassination, and all of his records are just unaccounted for. Time: 23:50 - 24:00 - Now, did he destroy them all? Maybe, I don't know. There's no real record of that, so you still have that previously destroyed issue. Time: 24:00 - 24:10 - In total, they finally released 5 million documents by 2017, basically everything except for a few thousand documents Time: 24:10 - 24:20 that the CIA still refuses to release. Why? Guys, come on. You can find this whole trove of JFK documents Time: 24:20 - 24:30 on the National Archives' website. We'll put a link in the description. Okay, but here's the craziest part of all of this. Even after 5 million documents were released to the American public, to a public that was like hungry for like conspiracy, Time: 24:30 - 24:40 still, there is no solid-smoking gun evidence in any of this that points to a conspiracy, Time: 24:40 - 24:50 that points to anyone other than Lee Harvey Oswald as the person who assassinated the President by himself, acting on his own. Now, the evidence may exist somewhere, but it's been destroyed or whatever. Time: 24:50 - 25:00 The point is, the government could have released these 5 million documents in the '60s. Like, they could have done this back when people wanted it, back when they should have, and it wouldn't have changed their official story Time: 25:00 - 25:10 and it would've satiated an American public that was skeptical of their government. At this point though, I think it's too late. The feeling that the government was hiding something Time: 25:10 - 25:20 has now sunk deep into the American psyche. We all kind of are like, \"The JFK assassination, yes, something was up there.\" I'm not really sure they're ever gonna regain our trust on this one because of how much hiding of information there was Time: 25:20 - 25:30 throughout all of these decades. So on the internet, all around, from people who are actually pretty credible, you have alternative explanations that abound. Time: 25:30 - 25:40 Maybe it was LBJ who planned it so that he could be president. Or what I believe is perhaps the most feasible theory, which is that some rogue faction in the CIA wanted to take out JFK because JFK was against what the CIA was up to. Time: 25:40 - 25:50 He was shutting down their covert operations. And then there's, of course, the idea that Cuba did it. I mean, that's what LBJ, the president after JFK, thought. Time: 25:50 - 26:00 Like, he was like, \"It was probably Cuba because we've been trying to assassinate their leader.\" The point is that because of the information vacuum left by the CIA and the FBI holding back evidence Time: 26:00 - 26:10 from the American people, people started to look at the evidence they did have and grasp at any evidence they could find for conspiracy. They started connecting the dots of the witnesses Time: 26:10 - 26:20 who met mysterious or suspicious deaths. Many theorists will fixate on this mysterious man holding an umbrella in this video on a sunny day, Time: 26:20 - 26:30 maybe giving the signal to a second shooter? It's all very tantalizing, and some of it is actually very valid as like leads for further investigation. Time: 26:30 - 26:40 But despite a lot of really fishy stuff, I have not seen any solid evidence that proves an alternative story to the one that was told to us back in the '60s Time: 26:40 - 26:50 that Lee Harvey Oswald was the guy who did it and he acted alone. I think it's very plausible that there could be some conspiracy. I think we will never know because we simply don't have the evidence. Time: 26:50 - 27:00 One thing I do know for certain though is that the moment this investigation turned into an effort to stifle information and influence the facts towards one conclusion, it laid the foundation for the public Time: 27:00 - 27:10 to turn this into a cesspool of speculation. Again, I keep going back to that feeling of being lied to by your government. It's very potent. Time: 27:10 - 27:20 It sticks with you. It creates fertile ground for conspiracy theories of all kinds to sprout. Because when you feel like you're being lied to by your own democracy, by your own leaders, Time: 27:20 - 27:30 no matter the reason or justification, it makes you feel like you're on your own, like no one's got your back, and that you are the one who needs to find the real truth. And to me, it's that space Time: 27:30 - 27:40 that the most enduring conspiracy theories find their footing. (tense suspenseful music) - Have you ever committed any act of violence in your life? Time: 27:40 - 27:50 - No. (tense suspenseful music ends) Time: 27:50 - 28:00Living under the american government is like playing a board game with a 10 year old who makes up new rules to favor themselves",

07:00 reality but these tools are getting like too sophisticated and too abstract and theoretical they're becoming too disconnected from like what I can see and understand and touch and Time: 07:00 - 07:10 feel they wanted to bring science back to what it had been for a really long time which is that like a person goes out uses simple tools like a telescope Time: 07:10 - 07:20 to look at the world and to make conclusions about how the world works so it's the 1800s science is like having its time and you have these guys usually Time: 07:20 - 07:30 from like the US and the UK who want to throw out this growing body of like amazing advancements in science and they start to do experiments here's what Time: 07:30 - 07:40 those experiments look like so it's the summer of 1838 England up in the county Time: 07:40 - 07:50 of Cambridgeshire which literally sounds like a place in the Lord of the Rings so it's the summer of 1838 and the atom had Time: 07:50 - 08:00 just been discovered and the Doppler effect is like being fleshed out and then you've got this guy his name is Samuel Rowbotham but he goes by the pseudonym parallax which is actually a Time: 08:00 - 08:10 pretty dope name like if I were a DJ I would totally go with like parallax anyway parallax decides even though all this science is happening he thinks it's time Time: 08:10 - 08:20 to reopen up the debate about whether or not the earth is a globe which was like literally settled thousands of years earlier but he's like no let's do and he Time: 08:20 - 08:30 finds this canal system that is incredibly straight this canal goes on further almost ten kilometres like six Time: 08:30 - 08:40 miles of just a straight line this guy says if the earth is a globe and people say it's twenty five thousand miles in circumference then if I look at it's straight line after the first mile the Time: 08:40 - 08:50 curvature of the earth would mean that the canal would now be eight inches lower after two miles it would be 32 inches lower after three miles 72 inches lower Time: 08:50 - 09:00 meaning like six feet almost two meters and so on so he thinks eventually the dip from the curvature of the earth would be so great that you could easily observe it Time: 09:00 - 09:10 so he gets in the water he puts a telescope right above the surface of the water and then puts a boat on the canal with a Time: 09:10 - 09:20 1 meter tall post on it so what he wants to see is if the earth is curved if it's a globe this post will start to disappear over the horizon so he does it Time: 09:20 - 09:30 the boat goes away it goes the entire six miles of the canal and it stays in sight the entire time it doesn't dip Time: 09:30 - 09:40 over the horizon and he's stoked he's like man I just proved that the earth is flat and I did it with a telescope and a boat like screw you science like I'm Time: 09:40 - 09:50 making breakthroughs right here in Cambridgeshire and then he writes this book where he flushes out this experiment and several others that he does but wait this experiments like kind Time: 09:50 - 10:00 of legit right it adds up like his numbers were all correct about the circumference and the tip of the curvature why didn't it dip like why was the boat still inside there's nothing Time: 10:00 - 10:10 wrong with this experiment I relaxed top that great name maybe he was onto something no no this is stupid this is Time: 10:10 - 10:20 like a third grade science experiment in your backyard this experiment doesn't take into account how the natural world actually works and how light behaves and refracts based on the different air Time: 10:20 - 10:30 densities this is like stuff that people already figured out and like parallax is sitting there getting wet in a canal like trying to observe this on it as Time: 10:30 - 10:40 know it this does not prove anything but parallax didn't want to hear any of this didn't want to talk about atmospheric refraction and air density and how light Time: 10:40 - 10:50 behaves in different media too complicated to abstract you can't touch and feel that stuff instead parallax sees science and observing reality as a much simpler task Time: 10:50 - 11:00 in his book he says nature speaks to us in a peculiar language in the language of phenomena she answers at all times the questions which are put to her just Time: 11:00 - 11:10 like go out and like put a question to mother nature and she'll answer it as scientific methods become more sophisticated they become harder for you and me to understand parallax and his Time: 11:10 - 11:20 canal experiments are reaction to all of this they are a call for a simplification of scientific methods and a return of the senses as Time: 11:20 - 11:30 the primary force for understanding reality he called his method of reduction as pseudoscience the zetetic method he says that honesty of thought is to look at truth in the face not the Time: 11:30 - 11:40 side face but the full front like just like look at it go out and observe it for yourself he was among several scientists and mathematicians at the time who were on Time: 11:40 - 11:50 this train of let's use really simplified reductionist math and science to prove that the earth is actually flat this argument of the Flat Earth Time: 11:50 - 12:00 flickered for a little bit in the 1800's gained a little bit of traction but then eventually it died out until just a few years ago refused to be another Time: 12:00 - 12:10 vegetable pseudoscience garbage will to me be unacceptable anyone would ask to see you don't have to be susceptible dispose of the globe in the nearest waste receptacle there's no curvature to Time: 12:10 - 12:20 this earth there is no motion to this earth you just accept the globe model with no understanding of the flat and no clear evidence for the ball earth do you Time: 12:20 - 12:30 see the problem there flat earthers are back and their methods are very similar to what parallax was doing in the 1800s and this is data this is repeat Time: 12:30 - 12:40 full observable measurable if you take the time to learn you will change your mind there's there's no doubt the only reason people think they live on a Time: 12:40 - 12:50 spinning ball is willful ignorance they're still zooming into horizons but now they have hordes of visual stuff to play around with they now have airplanes they now have Time: 12:50 - 13:00 satellite imagery to play around with they now have the moon landing to dissect and now they're taking levels onto airplanes like I did your plane Time: 13:00 - 13:10 can't go upside down here's the thing globehugger like the flat earthers in the 1800's the flat earthers today want Time: 13:10 - 13:20 to use their own intuition and senses to understand reality and in the process they reject and ignore the huge body of Time: 13:20 - 13:30 science that we all live with today so people that have physics degrees astronomy degrees he got their degree by regurgitating what their teacher of the Time: 13:30 - 13:40 books told them instead of trigonometry and telescopes and canals the flat earthers today use videos and photos circulated on the internet the has a Time: 13:40 - 13:50 muscle equidistant projection map that the usgs actually uses is the Flat Earth map wait did he just say as a thermal equidistant projection that's like my Time: 13:50 - 14:00 favorite projection is that the Flat Earth map don't with me and projections I take them very seriously in true internet fashion this new current Time: 14:00 - 14:10 movement of flat earthers has become just a bunch of bumper sticker type assertions and images that are really easy to share just like parallax's Time: 14:10 - 14:20 experiments these methodologies completely ignore the way the natural world is observed to work by like thousands of years of scientific consensus but if you go to the faq page Time: 14:20 - 14:30 of the Flat Earth Society you'll see what they're after here they believe that evidence is quote relying on your own senses to discern the true nature of Time: 14:30 - 14:40 the world around us that's the best evidence and in that vein that's how these people are doing I mean so in the physics world today do they not understand that convex lenses Time: 14:40 - 14:50 or fisheye lenses or GoPro add a distorted view so what have I learned from all of this from my understanding the flat earther Time: 14:50 - 15:00 movement whether from the 1800s or today on the Internet is actually not totally about the shape of the earth this movement has a much broader message built into it there's a reason why 1984 Time: 15:00 - 15:10 is like in the Canon of the flat earther movement 1984 has nothing to do with the shape of the earth what it does have to do with is being skeptical of big Time: 15:10 - 15:20 institutions that are probably watching you that are probably controlling your life that are probably feeding you bad information to retain power we're not crazy we're just secret lies here's the Time: 15:20 - 15:30 thing most of the knowledge we have about the natural world and the universe we've never seen we've never seen exoplanets or the deep space telescopes Time: 15:30 - 15:40 that tell us so much about our universe instead we read about this stuff we benefit from its findings we pay our taxes to fund more of it science is like Time: 15:40 - 15:50 a tall tower and each individual researcher and institution adds a little brick to that Tower each brick resting on the one below it no one person sees Time: 15:50 - 16:00 or understands all of the bricks instead we have a system of debate review scrutiny that only allows the most accurate information to be added to the tower and honestly I don't think Time: 16:00 - 16:10 humans are well suited to adapt to this very impersonal way of understanding the world we have evolved over millions of Time: 16:10 - 16:20 years with our senses as our main driver of survival and now we live in a society that is run by big systems and impersonal institutions that we will never touch and feel much less Time: 16:20 - 16:30 understand and that's why we have people who believe the world is flat despite conclusive evidence to the contrary this Time: 16:30 - 16:40 belief is a proxy for a much larger paradigm that mistrusts anything that you can't touch and feel and so yeah I'm really sad that only 84 percent of people can say with certainty that Time: 16:40 - 16:50 they've always believed that the world as a globe and that's 64 percent or younger people only 64% of people like that that just blows my mind and it's incredibly sad but despite this Time: 16:50 - 17:00 belief this movement these conventions this total lunacy science will continue to do its thing it will continue to go out observe the world with these amazing Time: 17:00 - 17:10 tools that we have come back debate it and add to this tower of knowledge that helps us see the world as it really is Time: 17:10 - 17:20 I want to thank Skillshare for sponsoring this video Skillshare is this amazing giant repository of online tutorials where you Time: 17:20 - 17:30 can learn everything you can imagine from photography to design to illustration to character animation to filmmaking to entrepreneurship all the things and you get unlimited access to Time: 17:30 -

      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:10 okay so i've been investigating something for a long time probably deeper than i've gone on any other video for a while at least Time: 00:10 - 00:20 something i never thought i would be investigating but i am i'm investigating mcdonald's ice cream machines who wants to go get ice cream Time: 00:20 - 00:30 can i get an ice cream cone we don't have ice cream right now not today not today maybe tomorrow or something or next week i don't know does that happen a lot like that the machine's down yeah Time: 00:30 - 00:40 yeah okay for a few years now people have taken notice that the ice cream machines at mcdonald's always seem to be down the ice cream machine part is not working Time: 00:40 - 00:50 the broken ice cream machines at mcdonald's have been the fodder for a lot of weird internet culture one guy even made an interactive map that shows every single mcdonald's that Time: 00:50 - 01:00 has a broken ice cream machine at this current moment so i reverse engineered the android app i think it was like it was a meme but nobody actually knew if this meme was Time: 01:00 - 01:10 correct or not but they didn't know that that was like like an actual thing that all the franchises are struggling with but a couple months ago i got an email from a guy who said that he had Time: 01:10 - 01:20 a deeper story he said that there are important questions that no one is asking and he promised me answers to those questions and data and evidence to back it up he even said that Time: 01:20 - 01:30 there's potentially something nefarious going on here i was like okay cool another conspiracy theory about these mcdonald's ice cream makers so i asked my producer jack to get on Time: 01:30 - 01:40 the phone with this guy and hear him out a week later jack called me and there's actually something going on here i've been going through everything and Time: 01:40 - 01:50 you really need to see this okay i was still highly skeptical that this could be anything worth a video or an investigation but i decided to dive in anyway and see Time: 01:50 - 02:00 this evidence for myself i started looking at data at internal mcdonald's emails at these mind numbing 100 page instruction manuals for Time: 02:00 - 02:10 ice cream makers i started talking to mcdonald's franchise owners and managers and yes it turns out there is something really weird going on here something Time: 02:10 - 02:20 that hasn't been reported on before and something that shows that mcdonald's broken ice cream machines actually reveal a bigger story about how big businesses Time: 02:20 - 02:30 protect one another even if that means hurting their customers i never thought i'd be going down a deep investigation into ice cream makers Time: 02:30 - 02:40 but i am and i did and i want to share with you what i learned [Music] mcdonald's is getting on my [ __ ] nerves and the machine is always down the ice cream Time: 02:40 - 02:50 machine is broken and if we try to pull the lever this will happen sorry the ice cream machine is broken the broken mcdonald's ice cream machine Time: 02:50 - 03:00 epidemic has been so widespread so long that it's a meme you know what they're gonna say you already know the ice cream machine is broken ice cream machine is broken Time: 03:00 - 03:10 [Music] kinda sounds like there's a story behind that one doesn't it [Music] Time: 03:10 - 03:20 in this very moment if you look at mcbroken around 13 of ice cream makers in the united states Time: 03:20 - 03:30 are not working that's any red dot on this map what a brilliant little tool rashik made i mean this is just so good so jack why are the ice cream Time: 03:30 - 03:40 machines always broken so once the internet started to notice this the wall street journal and business insider and a bunch of other outlets started to report on it and the conclusion that they came to was that Time: 03:40 - 03:50 these machines aren't actually broken they're just going through a really long and really complicated cleaning cycle that lasts four hours at a time and when that happens the employees tell you it's Time: 03:50 - 04:00 broken because it's just easier but don't take my word for it so when you go there and they tell you it's broken there's a high chance it's not broken it's just shut up for maintenance Time: 04:00 - 04:10 okay so human error and this long cleaning cycle that was the conclusion that like everyone came to and everyone seemed to be satisfied with that Time: 04:10 - 04:20 i mean i would be satisfied with that it's a pretty tight conclusion but hold on a second wait a minute Time: 04:20 - 04:30 do you guys have frosties yeah i was just at mcdonald's and the ice cream machine was broken and it seems like it always is is the ice cream Time: 04:30 - 04:40 machine broken here very often no yeah that's a mcdonald's problem we wash our machines everything oh that's cool is it easy to do that or is it pretty complicated no it's actually really easy to clean it Time: 04:40 - 04:50 they're just lazy it's the longest trigger so wendy's doesn't have this problem and what's crazy is that they use the Time: 04:50 - 05:00 same brand of machine as mcdonald's does and yet they don't have a make broken it's not an internet meme for them nor is it for other places that use the Time: 05:00 - 05:10 same brand of ice cream maker like in and out or chick-fil-a or a bunch of others so why is it only mcdonald's that has a problem with the broken ice cream maker Time: 05:10 - 05:20 [Music] if you want a real answer on this you Time: 05:20 - 05:30 need to talk to the people who suffer the most when these machines broken which actually isn't mcdonald's corporate it's the people who own these individual restaurants or franchises Time: 05:30 - 05:40 these are the people who pay the price in lost revenue when the machine is broken so i talked to them i talked to managers who actually deal with broken machines and i also Time: 05:40 - 05:50 went deep in this 111 page owner's manual which is not a read i recommend but i will summarize what it says Time: 05:50 - 06:00 what i've found is as mind-boggling as it is infuriating to understand this you have to understand how these ice cream machines work and why they break so i ask you to bear Time: 06:00 - 06:10 with me as we learn how an ice cream machine at mcdonald's works and why they always break once you understand that you will understand who is getting Time: 06:10 - 06:20 rich every time one of these things breaks and why they have an incentive to keep them broken and i was like okay i'm gonna guess it's Time: 06:20 - 06:30 gonna be around like five percent and it came back to like 13 which is insane one question that needs to be asked is should you be building ice cream Time: 06:30 - 06:40 machines if after 17 years you still can't get the software right no yeah that's a mcdonald's problem Time: 06:40 - 06:50 okay really quick i just want to talk about life insurance something we don't really want to talk about very often but we should probably talk about it in fact for the past year and a half i've been trying to get life insurance Time: 06:50 - 07:00 and i haven't been getting it because i've been like how do i even get life insurance and what have been is life insurance and all that the sponsor of today's video answers that question policy genius is a Time: 07:00 - 07:10 marketplace where you can go and shop around and save on life insurance did you know that the younger you are the cheaper life insurance is most of you are young Time: 07:10 - 07:20 and therefore most of you could lock in a really good life insurance rate for the next 20 30 years these are just smart things to have to plan for the future policy genius Time: 07:20 - 07:30 isn't an insurance company there's just a marketplace there's a place where you can go and choose from a bunch of different plans and then they handle all the paperwork Time: 07:30 - 07:40 which like for someone like me who hates paperwork that is a huge benefit i'm going through this process right now like i'm i'm not kidding i'm not just saying this like for the sponsorship i'm literally going through this process right now because of policy genius Time: 07:40 - 07:50 and i'm getting life insurance because i think i need to be smart like a smart adult and do this and i'm young so my rate is going to be actually quite affordable and one of my favorite parts Time: 07:50 - 08:00 about this whole thing is that policy genius doesn't sell my data and information to other companies which is actually a really rare thing nowadays so thank you palsy genius for Time: 08:00 - 08:10 that so go to policygenius.com johnny harris to shop the marketplace and start saving money today you could save 1300 or more per year by using policy genius to compare Time: 08:10 - 08:20 life insurance policies you could save 50 or more on life insurance by comparing quotes with policy genius i love when old legacy industries get Time: 08:20 - 08:30 updated to new modern companies that are more seamless and smarter and that are on the internet and that's what policy genius is so Time: 08:30 - 08:40 go check it out get life insurance that's what i'm doing right now let's get back to mcdonald's ice cream makers if somebody said i have a product that 10 or 12 of the time it's not Time: 08:40 - 08:50 functioning from an injured standard standpoint what does it look like that's not good at all being down for 10 all the time that's like Time: 08:50 - 09:00 no you can't you can't do that so let's look at the machine in question here it's this guy the c602 it's made by a company called taylor this machine is made specifically Time: 09:00 - 09:10 for mcdonald's taylor is like an og partner of mcdonald's they've been doing business together since the very beginning of mcdonald's they're both based like a few miles away from each other in Time: 09:10 - 09:20 illinois they are old old old business partners going back decades but like i said taylor makes ice cream machines for a bunch of other fast food restaurants like wendy and chick-fil-a and those machines aren't broken all the time so Time: 09:20 - 09:30 it's something very specific to mcdonald's and taylor that explains the ice cream machine issue if you want to start a mcdonald's franchise you sign an agreement with mcdonald's Time: 09:30 - 09:40 corporate that says i'm going to open a restaurant and i'll make sure that everything is standardized it's a part of this agreement that says you have to use this kind of french fry and you have to Time: 09:40 - 09:50 use one of two different companies for your fryer and your grill or whatever when this new ice cream machine came out in 2003 mcdonald's had it in their agreement with all their franchises Time: 09:50 - 10:00 which is like 16 000 in the united states that they had to use this machine no other machine they could not use any other machine on the planet they had to use the c602 made by mcdonald's and taylor Time: 10:00 - 10:10 it was in their agreement usually franchisees can pick between multiple different companies for the gear in their store Time: 10:10 - 10:20 not in this case you had to use the c602 so let's dive into this machine [Music] ice cream is dairy and dairy needs to be Time: 10:20 - 10:30 kept at a certain temperature to stay safe the machine itself has all these pipes that have dairy going through it all the time so what they do once per day is they heat up the whole Time: 10:30 - 10:40 machine including the ice cream mixture to like 151 degrees fahrenheit they leave it at that temperature for a while while it kills off all the bacteria and then it comes back down to a Time: 10:40 - 10:50 freezing temperature where it turns into ice cream that process takes about four hours and this is the thing that you hear about all the time as the explanation for why the machine is always down Time: 10:50 - 11:00 [Music] but here's the nuance here that really illuminates the story Time: 11:00 - 11:10 usually the employees do this overnight while the store is closed someone in the night shift gets the cleaning cycle going and then they lock up for the night the next morning Time: 11:10 - 11:20 new employees who are opening the store for the morning show up and they look at the ice cream machine and on the screen they usually see one of two things heat cycle was successful the ice cream Time: 11:20 - 11:30 machine is ready to use or heat cycle failed they don't know exactly why the heat cycle failed overnight they're looking at this interface that looks like it's from like 1983 Time: 11:30 - 11:40 and all they see is something like heat mode failure or some other obscure code that doesn't really tell you what happened the machine is completely locked out until you successfully run one of these Time: 11:40 - 11:50 heat cycles you have to run the heat cycle even if the heat cycle missed one of these benchmarks by like one degree it's still just gonna tell you the thing failed doesn't tell you why or by how Time: 11:50 - 12:00 much so the employee tells their manager the manager has no idea why the heat cycle failed and so they just tell their employee to like run it again luckily it's the morning so people Time: 12:00 - 12:10 aren't getting ice cream yet but like run the heat cycle again so employee runs the heat cycle again and it fails again probably for the same reason it failed in the first place which nobody knows at this point ps as a c602 ice cream machine insider Time: 12:10 - 12:20 the reason why it failed probably is because the hopper is a little bit too full of the ice cream mix and it takes a while for it to heat up and cool down Time: 12:20 - 12:30 that massive matter so just fill it a little bit less next time that's one of many reasons why it might fail anyway nobody knows this because they're just sitting there trying to serve customers i worked in fast food in high Time: 12:30 - 12:40 school it's a chaotic world you're just trying to make people happy meanwhile the person's trying to like run the heat cycle it fails again so the heat cycle fails again Time: 12:40 - 12:50 manager is pissed you have angry people asking for ice cream and everyone's just saying like yeah the ice cream machine's down sorry we can't do anything about it so finally the manager calls the franchise owner Time: 12:50 - 13:00 the owner of the business and says what do we do and the franchise owner says we need to get ice cream sales going this is not okay we're losing money just call the guy Time: 13:00 - 13:10 just call the guy that's verbatim what one of the franchise owners told me he said when things are crazy Time: 13:10 - 13:20 i just tell them to just call the guy now we're getting to the heart of this the guy in this case means one guy or woman which is an authorized service Time: 13:20 - 13:30 technician from taylor the company who makes the machine remember this the ice cream machine isn't working right now [Music] Time: 13:30 - 13:40 now i just here to fix the ice cream okay uh yes okay because i've never seen the Time: 13:40 - 13:50 uniform that's why i'm a little bit oh okay yeah we switched things up oh [ __ ] so you're still tailored yes ma'am okay turns out that taylor is the only company that is authorized Time: 13:50 - 14:00 to repair and maintain these machines it's in their contract if you call anyone else but taylor first off they wouldn't know how to use it because it's such a strange esoteric machine but also you Time: 14:00 - 14:10 would void your contract your warranty so you call the service technician he or she comes to fix the machine we got our hands on some actual invoices that show how much these tailor repair Time: 14:10 - 14:20 people cost it's different in every market and for every scenario but somewhere to the tune of 144 for the first Time: 14:20 - 14:30 30 minutes and then up to hundreds of dollars for each additional 15 minutes thereafter so the desperate franchise owner the one who runs the business has to Time: 14:30 - 14:40 decide do i deal with angry customers who are yelling at me because i don't have ice cream or do i just call the guy and get them to come repair this at any Time: 14:40 - 14:50 cost it doesn't matter so these franchise owners end up paying thousands and thousands of dollars not because their employees are incompetent or they're bad at training but because Time: 14:50 - 15:00 this machine locks them out and they have no idea why they're looking at a screen that looks like this and all roads point to call the service technician i watched a Time: 15:00 - 15:10 bunch of advertisements for taylor company people who make this ice cream machine and do all the maintenance on it they hardly talk about their product here their advertisements are more about how great their repairs Time: 15:10 - 15:20 team is innovators don't build machines they solve problems this is an expert technician there are 6 500 tailor technicians worldwide ready Time: 15:20 - 15:30 to help you the taylor company a few years ago taylor was in talks to be acquired by another company called Time: 15:30 - 15:40 middleby they put together a pitch deck of all their financials to sort of say like look at how good our business is and on that pitch deck they stated that 25 of their revenue comes from this Time: 15:40 - 15:50 repair and parts service of their business yes they make ice cream machines but a quarter of their business comes from just maintenance and repairs this sort of Time: 15:50 - 16:00 recurring revenue revenue you can rely on month after month is like gold for investors people love this because this is like you can project how much money you're gonna get every month if you can rely on Time: 16:00 - 16:10 a certain channel of revenue in your business taylor can rely on services and repairs from mcdonald's ice cream machines Time: 16:10 - 16:20 remember up until just a couple of years ago for years and years mcdonald's franchises were only allowed to use taylor machines they had no options they couldn't be like wow this Time: 16:20 - 16:30 machine sucks i'm going to go somewhere else so they had to use the machines regardless and they had to use this specific machine that breaks all of the time our parts and service network Time: 16:30 - 16:40 is what makes taylor the company of choice for the food service industry no matter what time of the [ __ ] day the ice cream machine is Time: 16:40 - 16:50 broke donald is making my baby cry how we got our hands on the software for some of these machines Time: 16:50 - 17:00 to see how taylor has tried to improve the software component you would imagine that with a machine that is notoriously broken all the time it would update their software to give Time: 17:00 - 17:10 more useful feedback to the user like hey your cleaning cycle failed last night only by one degree and that's probably because your hopper was too full Time: 17:10 - 17:20 try to fill it a little bit less next time alas no since 2003 when this thing came out there have been quite a few software updates but instead of improving usability of the software Time: 17:20 - 17:30 the software has actually introduced just new sets of cryptic error codes that don't help anyone solve any problems i have spent hours in this Time: 17:30 - 17:40 instruction manual going through all of the error codes and what they mean i feel like maybe just maybe after reading this Time: 17:40 - 17:50 multiple times and like being in the weeds i could operate one of these machines and maybe understand what's going on when things fail but it is clear to me that this machine Time: 17:50 - 18:00 is not set up for the user to have success in diagnosing and fixing the problem one person i was talking to was like they just opened a store and they it was Time: 18:00 - 18:10 a brand new store brand new machine and they're like yeah in the first few months we called the guy like four or five times i am blown away that a product like this with software this cryptic and horrible Time: 18:10 - 18:20 can exist in 2021. the menus are horribly complicated the error codes are not helpful the buttons don't have words on them instead they're just like a bunch of Time: 18:20 - 18:30 symbols like it's like press the flavor button press the ice cream button to get to here like to access this menu press these two buttons at the same time it's like how could you ever expect Time: 18:30 - 18:40 somebody especially like an entry level employee who's been on the job for like a few days to understand any of this it is a product that is set up to fail and that has no incentive to improve because what this Time: 18:40 - 18:50 means for taylor is simply more services and repairs for their pocket 25 of their entire business is based on this and then there's the Time: 18:50 - 19:00 secret menu [Applause] [Music] in addition to the instruction manual Time: 19:00 - 19:10 that's given to users i also got a hold of the service manual that is given to the taylor service people like this is like the insider manual that gives you the whole Time: 19:10 - 19:20 picture on this machine i do not recommend you read it in this manual you learn about a separate menu for the service technicians it's called the service menu this one is not accessible to the user Time: 19:20 - 19:30 the person who owns the machine the franchise owner it's only accessible to the service techs who have the very specific code for it the existence of this service menu is found nowhere in the user manual the thing given to the Time: 19:30 - 19:40 person who owns the machine and yet according to this manual this menu contains quote critical operating parameters for the machine Time: 19:40 - 19:50 so wait if this machine is breaking all the time and you have a franchise owner who's trying to keep their customers happy and there's a menu where there are quote critical operating parameters Time: 19:50 - 20:00 that the owner doesn't have access to just call the guy just call the guy the machine is not meant to give the user a clear picture on why Time: 20:00 - 20:10 it's breaking a few weeks ago a taylor service technician realized that he was required to install this new software update on all mcdonald's machines he noticed Time: 20:10 - 20:20 that the update had a bunch of weird new error codes that made the machine worse and less functional so he posted a video about it asking for help from other service technicians shortly after he Time: 20:20 - 20:30 posted the video the video disappeared when asked what happened he responded with quote the system defeated me he was clearly told to take the video down somebody doesn't want Time: 20:30 - 20:40 this sort of thing on the internet now listen this isn't some conspiracy there's all sorts of weird conspiracies around the ice cream machines this isn't one of those this is actually very Time: 20:40 - 20:50 rational human and business behavior when one has a monopoly over ice cream makers and they've created a particularly shitty product that breaks all the time and gives users no clear feedback as to Time: 20:50 - 21:00 why it's broken this company has no incentive to improve in an open market the incentive to make your product better comes from Time: 21:00 - 21:10 competition and comes from basically ramifications you'll be driven out of business if you don't make a good product in this case that's not the dynamic and in fact having a bad product is incentivized Time: 21:10 - 21:20 because it means more money in services and repairs for this business and the reason why mcdonald's corporate is okay with that is because the cost isn't borne by them it's borne by local franchise owners who Time: 21:20 - 21:30 have to pay for services and repairs taylor has the capacity to make and improve ice cream makers they do that all the time at wendy's and chick-fil-a and in and out and yet the machine made Time: 21:30 - 21:40 for their og exclusive partner mcdonald's doesn't receive the same improvement and refinement instead it receives a bunch of new error Time: 21:40 - 21:50 codes and terrible user experience which always leads to call the guy one franchise owner i talked to said all roads lead to call the technician like this this Time: 21:50 - 22:00 product is designed to get you to call the technician at this moment as i'm talking to you 15 of all ice cream machines in the u.s are down the standard for most industrial Time: 22:00 - 22:10 products is that you have less than a one percent failure rate for your product in fact the real target for mass industrial products is 99.99966 Time: 22:10 - 22:20 of the time your product is working that means 3.14 errors for every 1 million opportunities Time: 22:20 - 22:30 what you're seeing here with 15 is a dismal failure and it is the product of no pressure or no incentive to improve and in fact a perverse Time: 22:30 - 22:40 incentive to keep it shitty the last chapter of the story is the one that is still developing today and it has to do with the email i got Time: 22:40 - 22:50 a few months ago from somebody who's deep in the middle of this i'm gonna lay out some facts here i'm gonna let the news play out over the coming weeks and months to see how this happens but here's what's going Time: 22:50 - 23:00 on the guy who reached out to me originally was someone named jeremy he's a tech entrepreneur he invented a product that could basically fix this problem of like terrible feedback to the user of these ice cream Time: 23:00 - 23:10 machines it's this device that you plug into your ice cream maker and it connects with your phone and it gives you solid reporting on all the things happening in your ice cream machine something that Time: 23:10 - 23:20 this does not do and it identifies like actionable things that you can do to train your employees to make sure that problem doesn't happen again basically it avoids this happening Time: 23:20 - 23:30 in the first place and avoid you needing to call the guy all the time as soon as jeremy launched this product it was a smashing hit with franchise owners they started selling hundreds of these things to franchises Time: 23:30 - 23:40 all across the country people magazine reports the chain has partnered with kitsch a company that created technology to help employees manage the machines and reduce downtime franchise owners i Time: 23:40 - 23:50 talked to said that instead of getting these vague error codes now they actually get like solid reporting on what is happening inside this machine and they can like train their employees Time: 23:50 - 24:00 to help avoid this now let me just caveat for a second jeremy and his company kitsch obviously have a big financial stake in this story i'm aware that he reached out to me and Time: 24:00 - 24:10 gave me some of this data and that there's a big conflict of interest in terms of like neutral journalism and my informant being somebody who stands to gain a lot of money Time: 24:10 - 24:20 if this story comes to light and that's why the story has taken me literally months to report i've had to go through and independently report and verify every single thing that jeremy has told Time: 24:20 - 24:30 me hence this so yes while there is a major stake for jeremy and kitsch for this story and for exactly what i'm saying here Time: 24:30 - 24:40 the fact is everything that i've said here checks out on my own independent reporting just let that be known okay so kitsch got so popular among franchise owners Time: 24:40 - 24:50 that at this conference where all the franchise owners got together late last year to have a conference to talk about mcdonald's things sounds like a riveting conference the head of this organization of franchise Time: 24:50 - 25:00 owners gets up and and says now this is no silver bullet but it's my belief that the information it provides increases awareness and results in faster reaction times Time: 25:00 - 25:10 when a problem does occur now to be clear this is not a mcdonald's approved piece of equipment i mean he sort of like endorsed it he was like this is a Time: 25:10 - 25:20 sweet product it's actually helping us out soon after this endorsement mcdonald's sends an email to all of its franchises that says that they've determined that Time: 25:20 - 25:30 kitsch is actually super dangerous it may cause serious safety risks and they recommend that the franchise owners stop using it Time: 25:30 - 25:40 saying that they will void their warranty if they do wait what so you have this device that is clearly solving a major problem and instead of being like whoa tell us more about this let's see if we can get this like Time: 25:40 - 25:50 approved and put it into more shops they blacklist it and they scare away a bunch of their franchisees from using it i reached out to mcdonald's directly to ask them point Time: 25:50 - 26:00 blank like wtf why are you blacklisting a product that has the potential to solve this problem that you get made fun of all the time on the internet for they came back to me with some boilerplate pr language about being Time: 26:00 - 26:10 committed to their customers and all this stuff being able to buy sweet treats and all this and then this little nugget at the end where they say that mcdonald's Time: 26:10 - 26:20 is testing a connectivity solution with an approved mcdonald's supplier in other words mcdonald's is working Time: 26:20 - 26:30 on a product that does exactly the same thing oh and the company that they're using to do this is called powerhouse dynamics who is wait for it Time: 26:30 - 26:40 owned by the same company that owns taylor they're under the same parent company taylor and powerhouse dynamics they're keeping it in the family oh and Time: 26:40 - 26:50 this device the new one that they're testing out doesn't give the full picture to the user it continues to block them out of certain aspects of the machine Time: 26:50 - 27:00 that could be useful in diagnosing why the machine is always broken the theme here is the same it has been the whole time two old companies that have been working together for a long time Time: 27:00 - 27:10 looking out for each other and keeping control over data so that they can save their own necks from being disrupted by new tech that is like this story like that is as Time: 27:10 - 27:20 old as time and it is happening right here in a potentially collusionary way again is this a deep conspiracy is there like secret backdoor Time: 27:20 - 27:30 deals going on no this is actually horribly predictable what this is is old companies who are afraid of being disrupted by smarter better products doing Time: 27:30 - 27:40 whatever they can to hold on to their share of the market this new connectivity product that mcdonald's mentioned to me basically does the same thing as kitsch but this new device doesn't actually Time: 27:40 - 27:50 give the full picture it still blocks the user out of those things that have been behind the technician secret menu the things that the user manual itself says are critical it's the same old Time: 27:50 - 28:00 story of keeping tight control over what data and experience the user has so that they can continue to maintain their exclusive Time: 28:00 - 28:10 relationship with services and repairs which is 25 of their business it's honestly smart shrewd cutthroat business behavior but you know who it hurts Time: 28:10 - 28:20 it hurts the franchisees and it hurts all of us who want to go buy mcflurries this is anti-competitive behavior trying to squash new products in the name of retaining control so there's a lot of Time: 28:20 - 28:30 nuance here that i've sort of blasted through very quickly but the upshot is that mcdonald's ice cream makers are broken more than everyone else's ice cream Time: 28:30 - 28:40 makers even though they're made by the same company because the company that makes them has no incentive to improve and in fact has an incentive to keep them bad over Time: 28:40 - 28:50 the years they've done a terrible job improving their software and they've kept employees managers and franchisees in the dark of what's actually going on Time: 28:50 - 29:00 with their ice cream maker preventing them from actually being able to fix it themselves and when finally someone comes with a product that could actually fix it they squash it in the name of Time: 29:00 - 29:10 their own product that does sort of a worse version of what that new product was going to do kitsch is suing mcdonald's for a bunch of stuff and go read into the lawsuit if Time: 29:10 - 29:20 you'd like and certainly in coming months we will learn the details of exactly how this is all going down but for now next time you're at mcdonald's and they don't have ice cream just know that it's not because of lazy Time: 29:20 - 29:30 employees it's not because of lack of training it's because there's an old relationship between two old companies that don't want things Time: 29:30 - 29:40 to change Time: 29:40 - 29:50I hope this goes ultra viral because I feel like that's the only way things could change for the better",

00:30 I think poisoned by politics and and and Trump sort of using it for everything that he doesn't like and it kind of makes it hard to approach it earnestly Time: 00:30 - 00:40 but I I think we we have to keep digging like think there's something here is the Deep State real is the Deep State Time: 00:40 - 00:50 real there's this moment in the' Time: 00:50 - 01:00 60s where you really like see how this actually works like where power really is to the height of this moment where the US and the Soviet Union are in this Time: 01:00 - 01:10 like massive staring contest there's nuclear weapons involved everyone thinks the entire Globe could be wiped out in this conflict and Cuba is centered right in the middle of it all right off the Time: 01:10 - 01:20 coast of the US but they're on the Soviet side of the conflict the us at this point wants nothing more than to snatch Cuba to make it their own and they've been trying to kill Fidel Castro Time: 01:20 - 01:30 a million different ways they're looking for an excuse to invade and to push back on all of this the Soviets actually start shipping nuclear weapons to the Time: 01:30 - 01:40 island the US has no idea until one day a spy plane is flying over the island and they snap this wild Time: 01:40 - 01:50 photo I mean it doesn't look like a wild photo it just looks like a a random field in Cuba but you zoom in and you see canvas tents trailers missile launch Time: 01:50 - 02:00 equipment I mean the US government immediately knows what they're looking at here the world's most destructive weapons are actually hiding under these tents ready to launch sitting right in Time: 02:00 - 02:10 the United States backyard right off their Coast nuclear war 103 Mi away within the past week unmistakable evidence has established the fact that a Time: 02:10 - 02:20 series of offensive missile sights is now in preparation on that imprisoned Island it's a crisis a Cuban Missile Time: 02:20 - 02:30 Crisis and one man in Washington DC suddenly has a really difficult decision Time: 02:30 - 02:40 to make everyone around him wants him to invade Cuba but he's not sure okay but here's the kicker of the whole thing Time: 02:40 - 02:50 instead of stay at work that night and like figure out this crisis with his advisers Kennedy gets in a car and travels across town to like a cocktail Time: 02:50 - 03:00 party he came here to a house in Georgetown the home of Joe alsa one of the nation's most influential newspaper columnist it was the eve of nuclear war Time: 03:00 - 03:10 and the president of the United States kept his dinner date in Georgetown and the reason why is because at that party were the people he trusted the people who really had power in Washington Time: 03:10 - 03:20 during that time most of them lived here in this neighborhood many of them side by side all within a few blocks William Colby the Far East chief of the CIA he Time: 03:20 - 03:30 would later become the director of the agency chip Bolan a former ambassador to the Soviet Union Alan does who boy Alan doues where do to even start he's the cia's longest running director and he Time: 03:30 - 03:40 lived right here in Georgetown Frank Weisner one of the founding officers of the CIA he lived just six blocks away Felix Frankfurter a Supreme Court Justice just a couple minutes walk away Time: 03:40 - 03:50 and Kennedy himself had a house in this [Music] neighborhood the reason JFK kept his date in Georgetown that night was was because this is where power in Time: 03:50 - 04:00 Washington was on the other side of town from the capital building the seat of American democracy the decisions were being made here by unelected men who had Time: 04:00 - 04:10 an immense amount of secret power these were powerful men who were not elected or accountable and at this Time: 04:10 - 04:20 point they' become drunk on the worst kind of power the secret sort of power that corrupts the kind of power that our Founders sought to check and balance Time: 04:20 - 04:30 with all of their founding documents but here in Georgetown it had moved beyond anything the designers of the country could have predicted into a shadowy separate part of our government a deep Time: 04:30 - 04:40 state that was actively blackmailing the Congress and working to undermine the president of the United States and being horrifyingly successful at it unelected Time: 04:40 - 04:50 deep State operatives who defi the voters to push their own secret agendas you take on the intelligence Community they have six ways from Sunday at Time: 04:50 - 05:00 getting back at you so even for a practical supposedly hard-nosed businessman he's being really dumb to do this far as I know we don't engage in assassinations and kidnappings and Time: 05:00 - 05:10 things of that kind I do think there has to be serious questions raised about some of the foreign policy blunders that this country has had over the last 20 to Time: 05:10 - 05:20 25 years there's some truth in the idea that there is an ongoing group of people who continue the work of government Time: 05:20 - 05:30 as administrations come and go is it possible for these entities to go Rogue absolutely was the agency involved in the kind of domestic surveillance that Time: 05:30 - 05:40 has been portrayed in the news reports my feeling is that it has not okay I'm doing this the Deep state is Time: 05:40 - 05:50 the Deep State real and if so what is it before we do that I want to take a moment to say thank you to our sponsor nordvpn is a longtime sponsor of our Channel we couldn't make this work if we Time: 05:50 -

07:40 what you do and and what your relationship to this topic of the history of the CIA is yeah so um my name is Jefferson Morley I'm a journalist in Washington I've been a journalist in Washington for the last 40 years in the Time: 07:40 - 07:50 old days spy agencies were a war thing when the US was at War it would set up an international spy operation to best Time: 07:50 - 08:00 wage that war and then when the war was over they would pair down or totally get rid of the spy agency the thinking here was that a spy agency took up a lot of resources and threatened civil liberties Time: 08:00 - 08:10 a lot of power concentrated into a bunch of unelected people worth it during war not worth it during peace but then the Time: 08:10 - 08:20 biggest war of them all came to America's Pacific doorstep and it changed everything and bombing out har by enemy Time: 08:20 - 08:30 and so Roosevelt now has a license more of a license to do what he wants and one of the first things he does is consult with a man named Bill Donovan Wild Bill Time: 08:30 - 08:40 a corporate Wall Street lawyer who was obsessed with the power of intelligence Donovan had very strong opinions and he said you need a wartime intelligence service you're going to war Wild Bill Time: 08:40 - 08:50 Donovan would be in charge of the office of strategic services or OSS a centralized intelligence agency Time: 08:50 - 09:00 that would be given immense power to do whatever it took to keep our people safe and to keep our team on top this was the birth of modern intelligence a euphemism Time: 09:00 - 09:10 for spying and lying and cheating and deceiving and sneaking and breaking coercing dividing and conquering no idea Time: 09:10 - 09:20 was too crazy for the OSS during this time like one OSS psychologists had this idea that Hitler could be demoralized if they just showed him a vast quantity of horn paramilitary operations strapping Time: 09:20 - 09:30 explosives to a bunch of bats and letting them loose over Tokyo guys skiing into Nazi occupied Norway making fake companies recruiting off Wall Time: 09:30 - 09:40 Street from all of his old colleagues bringing in bankers and movie directors fake radio stations anything to demoralize divide or confuse the enemy Time: 09:40 - 09:50 the OSS is the first intelligence agency that the United States ever has oh and one of Wild Bill's favorite things to do was to have parties at is Time: 09:50 - 10:00 house are we the first ones here the big night to plan and plot his operations with his friends in Georgetown a neighborhood in Washington DC that is Time: 10:00 - 10:10 strikingly beautiful here is Bill Donovan's house it's now worth $17 million it's beautiful and this is where he would have a drink and chat with Time: 10:10 - 10:20 other Washington power Brokers he would recruit new Agents from American High Society earning the agency the nickname oh so social pretty clever okay but remember remember that spy agencies like Time: 10:20 - 10:30 this were a war thing only and the war ended in 1945 and the OSS got dissolved the forces of Germany have surrendered Time: 10:30 - 10:40 to the United Nations what do we do with the OSS now that we're at peace and Truman says we don't want to risk having an Time: 10:40 - 10:50 American Gusto a political police his meaning especially in the context of having just defeated the Nazis was you know that's what led our enemies stay they had a secret intelligence agency Time: 10:50 - 11:00 the gapa which wound up enforcing political norms and enforcing tyranny and we don't want to we don't want to risk that here's Harry Truman doing the right thing and signing a Time: 11:00 - 11:10 piece of paper that says that the OSS can no longer exist I mean Truman was freaked out he's like this was really great to help us win the war but this is way too much power in the hands of Time: 11:10 - 11:20 unelected officials holding secret information but it was kind of too late putting the genie back in the bottle would prove to be an impossible Time: 11:20 - 11:30 task is it significant that all these guys live four blocks from each other in Georgetown yeah it's very significant because they're the product of this Time: 11:30 - 11:40 wartime culture this is one party that just has to turn out right here is Target number one for the Reds and who's in the bullseye you are so there was a brief Time: 11:40 - 11:50 moment after World War II when the Cold War didn't exist we were at peace but then almost immediately tension started started to rise between these two great Time: 11:50 - 12:00 Empires that had been allies to defeat the Nazis but were now skeptical of each other and senators were suddenly declaring that it was impossible to know where War begins and where it ends the Time: 12:00 - 12:10 Soviet Union and its agents have destroyed the independence and Democratic character of a whole series of nations in Eastern and Central Europe Time: 12:10 - 12:20 and this is when all the Intel people that had run the OSS many of them who lived in Georgetown by the way start calling for the resurrection of the OSS a centralized intell agency that we can Time: 12:20 - 12:30 use to fight this new global war with the Soviet Union but no say a bunch of other lawmakers the Constitution wasn't designed for us to put so much power in Time: 12:30 - 12:40 the hands of men who are doing Secret Things doing this will result in a police state run by power grabbing Time: 12:40 - 12:50 bureaucrats too much power to military leaders and their insatiable appetite for more money for more men and more power whatever the to democracy Truman's Time: 12:50 - 13:00 mind changed and what changed Truman's mind was the growing confrontation with the with the Soviet Union and soon the papers were signed and a new agency was Time: 13:00 - 13:10 formed the Central Intelligence Agency the CIA when Truman signs the National Security Act he says we have to be careful that we don't have an American Time: 13:10 - 13:20 Gusto so that thought is still on his mind CIA was the big shiny new weapon of the United States in the Cold War and their mission was to quote gain and Time: 13:20 - 13:30 distribute intelligence and to perform quote other functions and duties related to intelligence affecting National Security what does that mean everybody Time: 13:30 - 13:40 knew what that language meant everybody knew that that was and we just weren't going to talk about it because we didn't want to write it down on paper like what do they do with this vague Mandate of Time: 13:40 - 13:50 National Security oh boy they they go to town you must stir the ingredients your chocolate Time: 13:50 - 14:00 cake feel so clean but so soft and smooth operation paper 1945 to 1959 Americans wanted to get those Nazi Time: 14:00 -

16:40 investigating them and reigning them in these agencies had harmful personal information on lots of people when I was doing my Angleton book a guy told me one Time: 16:40 - 16:50 day when he went to meet Angleton angelon quoted back to him what he had said to his wife in bed the night before Jesus and so they had this capacity and people Time: 16:50 -

19:00 anti-war movement but it's not controlled by them it's not funded by them it's pretty much an American thing you know but that doesn't change anything and they chaos continues to Time: 19:00 - 19:10 grow and eventually by 1970 there's 30 officers working on it hundreds of agents and you know the ostensible purpose of chaos to detect a foreign Time: 19:10 - 19:20 hand I mean chaos was in existence for seven years every time they were asked to report on it they came back and said it's not foreign control and it's not foreign funded which was obvious to Time: 19:20 - 19:30 anybody who was involved in the anti-war movement there were a lot of people inside the CIA saying you know we're spying on our wives and kids basically you know they're going to the Time: 19:30 - 19:40 demonstrations and we're reading the reports at night we shouldn't be doing this are we trying to extrema an entire people what are what Have We Become as a nation Americans were waking up to the Time: 19:40 - 19:50 fact that these unelected men were wielding way too much power and spying not only on the entire world but on Americans themselves Time: 19:50 - 20:00 [Music] we have been victimized by excessive secrecy not only with respect to the Time: 20:00 - 20:10 failure of the Congress in the past to exercise proper surveillance over intelligence activities but also excessive secrecy has created this kind of Mischief within the executive branch Time: 20:10 - 20:20 senator Frank Church helped lead the charge of taking all of these secrets and excesses and thrusting them onto the national stage and Shining a light on Time: 20:20 - 20:30 them there has never been a full public accounting of FBI domestic intelligence operations the American people are learning for the first time just how bad Time: 20:30 - 20:40 this was 800 Witnesses 10,000 documents their secrets were shared CIA Time: 20:40 - 20:50 FBI NSA assassination plots does this pistol fire the dart yes it does chairman when it fires it fires silently Time: 20:50 - 21:00 almost silently yes spying on Americans a wholly comprehensive listing of everything those people thought or did Time: 21:00 - 21:10 on any subject you can imagine they're having a concern with targeting people like Martin Luther King Jr and other civil rights or feminist activists Bureau agents were told to attack the Time: 21:10 - 21:20 new left by disinformation and misinformation anti-war protesters were spied on and intimidated coel Pro is the Time: 21:20 - 21:30 name for the effort by The Bureau to destroy people and to destroy organizations or as they use the words Time: 21:30 - 21:40 disrupt and neutralize the bureau went so far as to mail Anonymous letters to Dr King and his wife King there is only one thing left for you to do you know what it is you have just 34 days in Time: 21:40 - 21:50 which to do it you are done that was taken by Dr King to mean a suggestion for suicide was it not our understanding Time: 21:50 - 22:00 Senator the cia's LSD mind control experiments were also detailed to the public one of the first things they come across is the MK Ultra papers and so Time: 22:00 - 22:10 were the FBI and cia's attempts to infiltrate the Free Press planting journalists within our newspapers we would later learn in some investigative Time: 22:10 - 22:20 reporting that that this infiltration of the Free Press was much more widespread than Church even discovered he reported that up to 400 journalists had been paid by the CIA under operation mockingbir Time: 22:20 - 22:30 and there's there's no doubt that it was a massive effort and and and and effective the church committee made a few things clear number one that indeed Time: 22:30 - 22:40 a group of unelected government employees used immense power and resources of the United States government to pursue programs that were Time: 22:40 - 22:50 illegal unethical and generally out of line with American values and norms and they did it in secret outside of any set of accountability partly because the US Time: 22:50 - 23:00 Congress wanted to give them money and turn a blind eye I can recall uh members of Congress who uh uh Time: 23:00 - 23:10 recoiled from responsibility of knowing what was happening members of Congress who said don't tell me I don't want to know I think that is an indictment of Time: 23:10 - 23:20 the Congress just as severe as any indictment which is labeled against any of the intelligence Community when Dulles wanted to get approval for the Time: 23:20 - 23:30 CIA budget all he had to do was take a Topline number to the chairman of the Senate armed services committee and he Time: 23:30 - 23:40 would say this is what we want for this year and the chairman of the Senate armed services committee would say okay that's what you've got and please don't tell us anything about what you're doing with it and so there was no internal Time: 23:40 - 23:50 challenge to this world of CIA people but here's the other thing that is so crucial here which is that when you listen to these hearing hearings you see people who thought they were doing the Time: 23:50 - 24:00 right thing who thought that they were doing what they needed to to protect the country during a very scary time after a 30-year period all of a sudden you woke up one morning and here was this Time: 24:00 - 24:10 creature that had been created that no one along the line had ever really contemplated each of these steps and I think initially were innocent honest honest steps many of these agents were Time: 24:10 - 24:20 Earnest Patriots but they were operating in a system free of accountability and transparency even Within the Deep State there are people who are doing things Time: 24:20 - 24:30 for altruistic and good reasons and then there are people who are doing things for their own selfish or bad reasons and you know exactly how many are in each Time: 24:30 - 24:40 category is you know sort of impossible to to delineate I got sucked in when I should have known better and where many other more intelligent sophisticated Time: 24:40 - 24:50 people have got sucked in in other areas so after the church committee all kinds of new oversight regulations come in there's new committees formed there's new regulations and suddenly the Time: 24:50 - 25:00 intelligence Community now finally has some kind of oversight the Deep state was reigned in now they did fight back church was undermined and intimidated by Time: 25:00 - 25:10 these agencies CIA people I mean they hated Frank Church Jim Angleton would go around and say Frank church was a KGB agent dick Helms raged against him Kissinger they couldn't believe that us Time: 25:10 - 25:20 intelligence was being opened up on the other hand Americans were like oh my God this is what was being done in our name but overall this is a story of American Time: 25:20 - 25:30 democracy doing what it's supposed to do reign in the worst impulses of humans with power and in the process avoiding disaster at least for a few decades one Time: 25:30 - 25:40 of you is about to be elected the leader of the single most powerful nation in the world have you formed any guiding principles for Time: 25:40 - 25:50 exercising this enormous power when it comes to foreign policy that'll be my guiding question is it in our nation's interests peace in the Middle East is in Time: 25:50 - 26:00 our nation's interests having a hemisphere that is uh free for Time: 26:00 - 26:10 trade some very very sketchy details reaching us here at Sky Time: 26:10 - 26:20 Center a new [Applause] threat Time: 26:20 - 26:30 and a new call to give power to professional spies and bureaucrats to keep us safe by doing secret things and by passing The Patriot Act we will make Time: 26:30 - 26:40 America safer while safeguarding our civil liberties and privacy and then of course new agencies all with variations on the same name 911 is kind of like a Time: 26:40 - 26:50 Pearl Harbor there's this desire you know we've been attacked anything goes we have to strike back this is an existential struggle and that same ethos of the early Cold War anything goes that Time: 26:50 - 27:00 returns big time after 9/11 and the CIA seeks or asserts without being checked Time: 27:00 - 27:10 all sorts of powers that they hadn't asserted before they implement the torture program they massively expand the warrantless wiretapping the kind of things that we had seen Angleton do in Time: 27:10 - 27:20 chaos those exact same techniques are revived and expanded after 9/11 you know on a very large scale taxpayers funneling money into millions of new top Time: 27:20 - 27:30 secret jobs 22 capital buildings worth of new office space that spring up all around this area where I live to house Time: 27:30 - 27:40 all these new secrets and inside them waterfalls of new programs so many weirdly named programs that no one Time: 27:40 - 27:50 leader could ever hear about let alone regulate all of them there's not a whole lot of effective oversight on something that has grown so big and so bushy and Time: 27:50 - 28:00 none of which should be known to the public that is until someone who's worried that history is repeating itself Time: 28:00 - 28:10 decides to Spill the Beans our breaking news this evening is the identity of the man who sent the Obama Administration into defend and explain mode this week his name is Edward Snowden he's an Time: 28:10 - 28:20 American former CIA employee and computer technician today he came out as the leaker of classified NSA documents that spell out a secret Sur and we all kind of wonder what if we actually need Time: 28:20 - 28:30 this now what if we need all these dark windows and top secret PowerPoint decks where they design how they're going to Time: 28:30 - 28:40 spy on us what if our safety relies on what happens inside of all these buildings so we keep funding them but in doing so we must at least acknowledge what we're doing here we are trading a Time: 28:40 - 28:50 portion of our freedom in exchange for a sense of security and in the process we're creating and feeding kind of a new Time: 28:50 - 29:00 branch of our government power one that operates outside of this elegant triangle that the founders constructed to trip up the corrupting forces that Time: 29:00 - 29:10 run the risk of always possessing men with secret power most everybody agrees that there's over classification there's way too much information that's that's Time: 29:10 - 29:20 classified but information is power and the fewer people that have it the more power the people that do have it have and the result is that when the most Time: 29:20 - 29:30 powerful man in the world arrives to the most powerful house in the world promising to Rin all of this in to reig in the excesses he actually finds that Time: 29:30 - 29:40 he can't he's not able to change much of it instead he sits there and watches much of the things that he critiqued grow under his watch the thing that he's Time: 29:40 - 29:50 supposed to control he finds he doesn't have that much control over these targeted strikes against Al-Qaeda terrorists are in indeed ethical and just Secrets keep us safe but Secrets Time: 29:50 -

00:20 to what it would look like to cross this 130 km wide straight to invade the island of Taiwan a place that China doesn't think is a real country but Time: 00:20 - 00:30 rather a part of China itself a rebellious Island province in an unfinished Civil War another round of Chinese war games near Taiwan has the Us Time: 00:30 - 00:40 and other nations concerned China did all this saber rattling because taiwan's president had asked for a visa to visit the United States and the US Congress voted to give it to him defying Beijing Time: 00:40 - 00:50 and undermining China's claim to Taiwan oh and Taiwan was holding their first democratic election these are the first free elections of a Chinese leader in Time: 00:50 - 01:00 5,000 years China announced Friday that it would start the new military exercises less than a week before taiwan's presidential election China hated that all of this was happening on Time: 01:00 - 01:10 this island that they think is theirs hence all of the military flexing but look who shows up next diplomatic trouble may be Brewing again between China and the United Time: 01:10 - 01:20 [Music] States it's the US military and they're Time: 01:20 - 01:30 sending their biggest show of military force in Asia since the Vietnam War right here in China's neighborhood President Bill Clinton sent in all of the US's best stuff aircraft carriers Time: 01:30 - 01:40 guided missile Cruisers destroyers powerful weapon systems from the most powerful military on Earth so all of Time: 01:40 - 01:50 this concentrated US military power comes into the region and enters right here through the straight of Taiwan it was a response to China and all of its efforts to intimidate taiwwan the Time: 01:50 - 02:00 message was very clear China we are way more powerful than you so back off and let Taiwan do its thing and guess what it totally worked China backed down and Time: 02:00 - 02:10 the US reasserted itself as the global Powerhouse a power that no one can mess with okay so now let's fast forward to last fall a lot has changed in this 20 Time: 02:10 - 02:20 or so years and China is at it again flexing on Taiwan their favorite way of doing this lately is flying military aircraft in into this air border Time: 02:20 - 02:30 taiwan's air defense identification zone or Adis an Adis is airspace that if you enter you should identify yourself or Time: 02:30 - 02:40 else the nearby country will assume that you're coming to attack them China has started flying military aircraft over this airspace without asking permission without identifying themselves not just Time: 02:40 - 02:50 like once or twice but like dozens of times per day hundreds of times a month these are the actual recorded flight Time: 02:50 - 03:00 Paths of Chinese aircraft flying over taiwan's AES and then back to China it's a giant Fu to Taiwan or rather remember who boss Time: 03:00 - 03:10 here luckily there's some really amazing data on every single one of these Chinese flyovers they're all documented taiwan's Air Force scrambled again today Time: 03:10 - 03:20 this is research from the foreign policy Research Institute and it's incredibly useful to see China's activity in taiwan's is you can see this massive Time: 03:20 - 03:30 surge late last year in flyovers this is a graph that shows every single time a Chinese jet has flown over taiwan's AES in 2021 you can see that it comes to a Time: 03:30 - 03:40 peak in the first week of October this was the week that China was celebrating its founding and they were sending a very clear message to Taiwan you will be Time: 03:40 - 03:50 ours that week this Chinese state-owned publication comes out with this headline time to warn Taiwan secessionists and their fentor war is real this is not Time: 03:50 - 04:00 fair play so guess who shows up to the region to calm things down a US warship has sailed through the Taiwan street so right after this huge bulk of Time: 04:00 - 04:10 flyovers of taiwan's 8s the US sends in guided missile destroyers through the Taiwanese straight and they're accompanied by a Canadian ship they worn Time: 04:10 - 04:20 off 25 Chinese aircraft that entered its Defense Zone oh but this time it didn't work here's when the US sailed through the straight Time: 04:20 - 04:30 and here's what China does after tons more flyovers of taiwan's a is looking at the raw data you can see that these flyovers start happening almost every Time: 04:30 - 04:40 day it's not the '90s anymore things have changed Bill Clinton can't just send a bunch of naval ships to the Taiwan straight and expect China to back Time: 04:40 - 04:50 down we're living in a different era the biggest difference is that China's military has become way more powerful in the last 20 years add to that that their Zeal for taking over Taiwan to reunite Time: 04:50 - 05:00 it with mainland China has grown immensely every year since the reason I'm telling you this story and showing you the difference between how China Time: 05:00 - 05:10 reacted in the 9s and how it reacted last fall is because that difference is really important if we want to think about what war looks like in this region Time: 05:10 - 05:20 I've been talking to military experts I've been diving deep into military reports and writings from the Chinese military itself to try to understand what what war with Taiwan would look Time: 05:20 - 05:30 like it's something that is becoming more likely Year bye so what's to follow is my best attempt at understanding what Time: 05:30 - 05:40 war in the Taiwan straight looks like a war that drags in the United States and its allies war is impossible to predict and so we don't know for sure but what I Time: 05:40 - 05:50 hope we can do here is look at a scenario and learn how conflict works and what calculations all the countries involved would have to make and what what might become the next World War I Time: 05:50 - 06:00 just want to make China understand that we are not going to step back China's aggression against Taiwan is accelerating and it's blaming the US Bing has been getting increasingly tough Time: 06:00 - 06:10 on Taiwan so are you saying that the United States would come to taiwan's defense yes and Time: 06:10 - 06:20 yes hey before we dive into this I want to say thank you to the sponsor of today's video who made this video possible thank you nordvpn for supporting this video a VPN is a very Time: 06:20 - 06:30 useful tool that allows you to connect to the internet but to do so via a different country so when I'm traveling I often want to get into my email and my Time: 06:30 - 06:40 email doesn't like that I'm in a different country they think I'm a hacker trying to get into my email and it's like no it's me this is one reason I love nordvpn I can connect to nordvpn Time: 06:40 - 06:50 and tell it to route my connection through the United States so now my email is like oh he's still in the United States he's fine that's one Time: 06:50 - 07:00 reason I use nordvpn the other is because it allows me to access tons more content there's a lot of stuff whether gaming or like Netflix that is not Time: 07:00 - 07:10 available in my country but if I route it through a different country I get access to a ton more entertainment options which is pretty cool nordvpn also focuses on security and encryption Time: 07:10 - 07:20 it doesn't throttle your speed so it doesn't like slow your internet down it's a very solid tool for security for entertainment and for travel at least that's how I use use it oh and it's Time: 07:20 - 07:30 super cheap there is a link in my description it's nordvpn.com Johny Harris if you go there you can get a 2-year plan at a big discount plus a bonus gift which will set you up with a Time: 07:30 - 07:40 very very good deal and if you discover that this is not useful to you or you don't like it for some reason you have 30 days to get all of your money back so there's no reason why you shouldn't go Time: 07:40 - 07:50 try it Go click this link it supports this channel when you do so and thank you nordvpn for sponsoring this video and now let's dive into the scenario Time: 07:50 - 08:00 about potential war between Taiwan and [Music] China okay I'm going to dive into a very specific scenario of how conflict could Time: 08:00 - 08:10 escalate in the Taiwan Strait but first I have to say something I have to get this off my chest which is I felt a little bit conflicted making this video Time: 08:10 - 08:20 I feel very against the sort of machismo fasination with conflict like it's some sort of cool good thing when at the end of the day what we're talking about are people's lives we are talking about Time: 08:20 - 08:30 valuable taxpayer money we are talking about the future of entire societies being ripped apart by a power struggle this is not sexy and cool this is a Time: 08:30 - 08:40 nightmare secondly let us all just acknowledge right now how easy it is to dehumanize China and its leaders and its Time: 08:40 - 08:50 military but let me just remind you that China doesn't want war they don't want Bloodshed they will probably try much less violent ways to try to force Taiwan Time: 08:50 - 09:00 to the negotiating table before resorting to allout Invasion but the reason I want to make a video about the nightmare scenario because even if a Time: 09:00 - 09:10 military has a goal for a less violent intervention that's not how War Works conflict is very messy and one miscalculation can lead to an escalation Time: 09:10 - 09:20 in the conflict and now you have a wild fire that is out of control on both sides it's incredibly easy for the momentum of conflict to bring us into that kind of situation and that's why I Time: 09:20 - 09:30 want to sus out what it could look like okay those are my disclaimers let's dive into Time: 09:30 - 09:40 this I'm going to start rolling here I'm just two okay I'm going to clap here it comes okay I need to bring you over to my desk to show you some documents I've been staring Time: 09:40 - 09:50 at any invasion of Taiwan starts with this document this is a Chinese law meant to Time: 09:50 - 10:00 stop any parts of China from seceding from China itself and it mentions Taiwan it basically says that if Taiwan tries to assert its independence from Time: 10:00 - 10:10 China or and this is the most important part or if the possibilities for a peaceful reunification should be completely exhausted that China shall Time: 10:10 - 10:20 employ non peaceful means and other necessary measures to protect China's sovereignty and territor Integrity Time: 10:20 - 10:30 translation if they run out of diplomatic Solutions China is required by law to invade Taiwan and force it to reunite with China and no I don't read Time: 10:30 - 10:40 or speak Mandarin but Google translate come on listen we're like 70 years into peaceful Solutions being tried and not Time: 10:40 - 10:50 working meanwhile on the island of Taiwan support for any sort of reunification is at an all-time low like it's not looking like peaceful reunification is going to happen which Time: 10:50 - 11:00 is making the interpretation of this law more and more on the side of China should do this forcibly okay so that's the legal justification from a Chinese perspective pair that with the fact that Time: 11:00 - 11:10 unlike in the 9s China now has a massive military there's new concern at the Pentagon about China's military buildup with all sorts of new missiles China Time: 11:10 - 11:20 could soon be able to deploy a nuclear tipped missile that us defenses would find much harder to detect tanks helicopters sub Marines ships I mean Time: 11:20 - 11:30 this isn't from me this is the US government they recently came out with a report that said that the Chinese Navy now is bigger than the US's Navy at least by numbers they have 360 versus Time: 11:30 - 11:40 our 297 ships now caveat to that data our ships are much bigger but still China's recent military buildup is nuts and this Time: 11:40 - 11:50 is why the US military is kind of freaking out my opinion is this problem is much closer to us than most uh think Time: 11:50 - 12:00 we have to take this on with urgency China is upping the anti on Taiwan and there are fresh fears of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan taking over Taiwan Time: 12:00 - 12:10 remains China's number one strategic Time: 12:10 - 12:20 priority okay so this is the moment that a lot of you probably came to this video for which is what does the war actually look like let's say that China feels confident that the only way that Taiwan Time: 12:20 - 12:30 is going to join China which is again a legal imperative is if they forcibly invade blockade isn't working negotiation isn't working the first strike on Taiwan would likely look like Time: 12:30 - 12:40 just another Chinese provocative Adis fly over China's done this hundreds of times so at this point Taiwan thinks that they're just doing another one of Time: 12:40 - 12:50 their routine Flex our military might exercises but this time the fighter jet turns towards the island and begins firing at the same time China fires Time: 12:50 - 13:00 guided missiles from the mainland and deploys tons more Jets and they all start firing in a fast highly coordinated attack the target here is Time: 13:00 - 13:10 anything that Taiwan can use to defend itself like weapons that can shoot down planes or boats that are coming onto the island I mean this could be anything Time: 13:10 - 13:20 radar communication nodes military command centers navy bases Bridges communication networks power stations even government government buildings Time: 13:20 - 13:30 they would have a wide variety of targets to effectively deny Taiwan the ability to respond effectively I mean unfortunately for Taiwan a lot of these Time: 13:30 - 13:40 targets are left out in the open they're easy to see a Runway is really easy to see and really hard to hide this first attack would happen very quickly one Time: 13:40 - 13:50 military expert Ian Easton put it very succinctly when he said assuming the intent is Invasion these ATT attacks could be expected to be concentrated in Time: 13:50 - 14:00 a short time frame as a Prelude to Invasion with no pauses other than those required for moving reloading and repairing Time: 14:00 - 14:10 equipment sounds horrible so taiwan's leaders are caught off guard and they immediately Retreat underground to a command bunker where they can plan their response luckily China will not be able Time: 14:10 - 14:20 to take out all of their military targets some of their aircraft hangers are deep in mountains and some of their missile SES are really well camouflaged they would escape the bombardment so Time: 14:20 - 14:30 Taiwan would have the ability to respond they would likely be able to get some air power into the air and fire some missiles towards mainland China to hit air bases radar and Military batteries Time: 14:30 - 14:40 on the mainland at this point Taiwan also sends troops to their Western beaches to start laying mines and preparing for an oncoming barrage of Time: 14:40 - 14:50 Chinese troops who are probably now on their way across the straight this has all happened within just a few hours and the US is just barely hearing about this Time: 14:50 - 15:00 China has likely jammed much of the communication channels that would allow the us to have a clear picture of what's going on this will slow their response Time: 15:00 - 15:10 time the thing is China has gotten really good at sending little robots up to satellites in space their civilian satellites to like help repair them they could use the same technology to latch Time: 15:10 - 15:20 on to an American spy satellite and block its ability to view what's happening on the ground yes we're now talking about conf in space as a Time: 15:20 - 15:30 feasible part of the scenario so the US is trying to get up to speed the US president and military leaders now have to decide how they're going to respond are they going to risk American lives to Time: 15:30 - 15:40 protect this far away Island it's something that the American public broadly would not be into but they have to do something they have to make a plan meanwhile back over in the straight Time: 15:40 - 15:50 taiwan's military assets are severely damaged and China is now sending hundreds of thousands of troops and loads of supplies across this 130 km Time: 15:50 - 16:00 stretch of water they're using boats of all kind military boats Merchant boats that don't need to defend themselves because Taiwan can't respond adequately Time: 16:00 - 16:10 and each of these vessels is carrying tons of supplies and troops but again on taiwan's Western beaches there are probably Taiwanese troops who have been Time: 16:10 - 16:20 planting mines ready for this Invasion so there's now a battle on the beaches as Chinese amphibious attackers try to hit the beaches and push back the Taiwanese defense we're going to Time: 16:20 - 16:30 continue assuming Taiwan doesn't give up and capitulate and surrender to China at this point if that's the case the US is now just starting to respond likely from Time: 16:30 - 16:40 their bases in the region Japan and Guam they deploy aircraft carriers with jets and bombers stealth Fighters as well as fast attack submarines that will focus Time: 16:40 - 16:50 on one thing hitting all of these ships the ones that are bringing stuff and people across the straight Japan and Australia likely come in as allies to Time: 16:50 - 17:00 help out on this defense and now the US and its allies are in direct combat with China two nuclear Nations fighting each Time: 17:00 - 17:10 other this is exactly what we try to avoid because we don't know where it goes from here we don't know where the ceiling is war always escalates and when Time: 17:10 - 17:20 there's nuclear weapons involved that's a very scary momentum there's even a scenario where China actually strikes first hitting us bases in Japan and Guam Time: 17:20 - 17:30 at the same time that they hit their initial Targets in Taiwan this would be a much more provocative move and would certainly bring the US full force into a war with China so now you have Chinese Time: 17:30 - 17:40 troops who have pushed back the Taiwanese defense on the western beaches and they are now moving in towards major city centers the US is fighting on the Time: 17:40 - 17:50 water and in the air and from here it becomes impossible to predict what could happen next there are so many different directions depending on the US's tolerance for Bloodshed there could be Time: 17:50 - 18:00 American troops on the ground trying to push back Chinese advancements Inland but if you look at Chinese military writings on this you'll see that as a part of this scenario when they're Time: 18:00 - 18:10 thinking about it they're not just thinking about the US and its allies and Taiwan they also predict that India will take advantage of this moment of chaos and invade the Himalayan borders to the Time: 18:10 - 18:20 South they even foresee Tibetan Freedom Fighters way out here in the west who have long been hostile towards Chinese rule rising up and taking advantage of Time: 18:20 - 18:30 the instability to gain back control of their region I mean you can see how this starts to unfold before you know it the entire region is devolving into a war Time: 18:30 - 18:40 that threatens to engulf many more countries hundreds of thousands of lives and this is where I want to stop because from here it just becomes so speculative as to be completely useless but I tell Time: 18:40 - 18:50 you this scenario of a potential invasion of Taiwan not because it's the most likely it's actually not the more likely situation is China will pressure Taiwan through blockades or through Time: 18:50 - 19:00 other painful pressures that will get them to come to the negotiating table I tell you this because this scenario is still absolutely a possibility what's Time: 19:00 - 19:10 scary to me about all of this and I've said this a bunch but I'm just going to keep saying it once something like this starts it's really hard to reverse it to put the cat back in the bag no one's in Time: 19:10 - 19:20 control that's a concept that's really hard to get your head around if you didn't live through a global war we live in an International System that feels like it has rules we have the UN we have Time: 19:20 - 19:30 treaties and conventions we have global trade it feels like there's some sort of order but let me remind you that that's because we live in the most peaceful Time: 19:30 - 19:40 time in human history this long peace where few people alive today witnessed what it looks like when two powerful countries clash in allout war it usually Time: 19:40 - 19:50 happens when some powerful leader feels strongly that he deserves land that the rest of the world says isn't his so he uses his big powerful Army to go take it and in the process he Sparks a horrible Time: 19:50 - 20:00 tragedy and while I hope more than anything that that doesn't happen in this case we have to remember how common place it is and that the peace between Time: 20:00 - 20:10 these big Powers is actually the outlier here I really hope that we are past needing to resort to this version of conflict to settle our disputes at this Time: 20:10 - 20:20 time in our history but I'm not totally convinced that we are yet and I think China and Taiwan this specific case is the best thing to look at to test Time: 20:20 - 20:30 whether or not we we can we can talk about it we can find creative ways to solve this instead of resorting to the thing humans have done forever which is just fight each other and see who Time: 20:30 - 20:40 [Music] wins okay so I appreciate you watching Time: 20:40 - 20:50 this video and would love to hear your thoughts um I left a bunch of sources down in the description where you can read a lot more about this from the Time: 20:50 - 21:00 really good research and reporting that has been done on this topic I've got a bunch more videos coming out in the next month so stay tuned And subscribe if you're not already um I also have Luts Time: 21:00 -

It is a manufacturing hub that produces goods for the\nentire world. And guess who their biggest trading partner is: THE UNITED STATES! China has an\nenormous trade surplus with the United States (meaning we buy more from them then they do from us). If\nthat line of trade evaporated overnight, it would absolutely decimate the Chinese economy.

00:20 and religious differences by the end of 1991 Croatia Slovenia and Macedonia have all declared independence Macedonia is allowed to leave peacefully but Slovenia Time: 00:20 - 00:30 and Croatia fight Wars to be independent from Yugoslavia and then you have Serbia populated primarily by Christian serbs and they were not going to let Time: 00:30 - 00:40 Yugoslavia fully fall apart together with Montenegro they attempt to become the successor state to Yugoslavia after all it was they who held the most power in Yugoslavia and who comprise the Time: 00:40 - 00:50 majority of the Yugoslav army they didn't want independent states they wanted to hold on to their majority to their power another country Tree in this Time: 00:50 - 01:00 crumbling Federation was the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina almost half of this country were Bosnian Muslims called bosniaks and about a Time: 01:00 - 01:10 third were Christian serbs similar to the Christian serbs Living up here but living in Bosnia the other 17 percent were croats for a long time these groups had lived side by side in relative peace Time: 01:10 - 01:20 they had a common ideology communism the idea of Yugoslavia but as all these new countries were being created no one wanted to end up in a new nation Time: 01:20 - 01:30 controlled by the other side so it's late 1991 and a largely croat region declares itself an independent state from Bosnia it wasn't recognized Time: 01:30 - 01:40 internationally while some croat leaders want to secede from the country entirely they first agree to cooperate with the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina acting like a state within a state the Time: 01:40 - 01:50 next year Bosnia holds an independence vote 63 percent of the population turns out and the results are that 99 of the voters say yes they want to be Time: 01:50 - 02:00 independent from Yugoslavia these numbers imply that it was mostly bosniaks that voted with the Bosnian serbs boycotting the vote as most were against becoming a minority in a new Time: 02:00 - 02:10 Bosnia so after the independence vote passed the Bosnian serbs declared their own state within the borders of Bosnia it was called Republica serbska no one Time: 02:10 - 02:20 recognized this new self-declared country besides one and it was the one that mattered Serbia and Montenegro now had this leader an important part of the story his name was Slobodan milosevic he Time: 02:20 - 02:30 recognizes the new Serb state within Bosnia and this marks the start of the Bosnian War Time: 02:30 - 02:40 [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey before I dive into this I just need Time: 02:40 - 02:50 to tell you that we don't have a sponsor for today because it's sort of hard to find sponsors for videos like this luckily the subscribers over at nebula help make these videos possible we publish our videos there every week a Time: 02:50 - 03:00 week early so our next week's video about Antarctica one of my favorite videos we've ever made ever it's freaking beautiful is up now on nebula you can go watch it it's 2.50 a month Time: 03:00 - 03:10 and it helps support us making videos like this I'll give more detail on that at the end of the video for now let's dive into this now before we go on we have to look back up here at Serbia this Time: 03:10 - 03:20 leader milosevic this guy was a hyper nationalist he made his career stirring up ethnic tensions between serbs croats and bosniaks so he's seen all of this as Time: 03:20 - 03:30 a good thing as an opportunity to further his vision of creating a new greater Serbian Nation across the former Yugoslavia and remember Serbia is where the capital of the former Yugoslavia was Time: 03:30 - 03:40 the Yugoslav Army is dominated by serbs so milosevic is able to direct to this professional Army to launch an offensive to help the serbians in Bosnia secure Time: 03:40 - 03:50 their new claimed territory foreign Time: 03:50 - 04:00 to fight back the bosniaks and croats form an alliance to protect their own chances of Independence but serbs have this large professional Army on their side it's much more powerful and it Time: 04:00 - 04:10 quickly surrounds the Bosnian Capital City positioning tanks artillery and snipers on the hills around the city blocking roads and supply routes their goal is to take the capital as fast as Time: 04:10 - 04:20 possible and to end this war quickly they start firing indiscriminately attacking civilian populations with tanks artillery and sniper fire killing thousands in a siege that would last for Time: 04:20 - 04:30 years and while this city was majority bosniak croats and serbs lived there too but the serbs pummeled It Anyway the U.N quickly attempts to negotiate with Time: 04:30 - 04:40 milosevic and Serb forces and they reach a quick agreement to withdraw the Yugoslav Army but what really happens is the Yugoslav Army just gives up control of around a hundred thousand Serb troops Time: 04:40 - 04:50 who mostly continue fighting for the serbs in Bosnia as Yugoslav forces withdraw from Sarajevo as part of this agreement the retreating forces are attacked by bosniak troops an unknown Time: 04:50 - 05:00 number of Yugoslav Army Personnel are killed bosniak commanders would later be charged with war crimes for this attack as the war rages on serbs escalate the Time: 05:00 - 05:10 brutality all over the country routinely identifying bosniak homes ransacking and burning them down rounding up civilians separating the men from the women and Time: 05:10 - 05:20 sending the men to concentration camps or executing them women are sent to prisons where they suffer abuses and human rights violations that I'm not going to describe here for how atrocious Time: 05:20 - 05:30 they are you can go to the sources for details the point here is that what the serbs are doing is starting to look like an ethnic cleansing of the land they Time: 05:30 - 05:40 claimed meanwhile the International Community is hesitant to get too involved Beyond cutting off the Yugoslav economy with sanctions and the UN sends food medicine and peacekeeping soldiers Time: 05:40 - 05:50 they also cut off the flow of weapons from the outside but the UN mostly sticks to its peacekeeping principles not interfering in the conflict not stopping in the advance of the serbs or Time: 05:50 - 06:00 the ongoing ethnic cleansing that has begun but the situation in Bosnia is getting worse the alliance between bosniaks and croats is falling apart they start fighting each other so now Time: 06:00 - 06:10 bosniak forces are fighting the serbs on one side and their former allies the croats on the other a war within a war as this new complicated stage of the conflict starts croat forces surround Time: 06:10 - 06:20 and begin an attack in the city of mostar a city that the two had once defended together back in 1992 against the serbs croat forces capture large Time: 06:20 - 06:30 portions of the city they blow up bosniak mosques and murder bosniak civilians in their wake things are getting bad and in response to these worsening conditions in Bosnia the UN Time: 06:30 - 06:40 gets NATO forces to come to Bosnia to enforce a no-fly zone basically committing them to shoot down any planes flying over the country but this does Time: 06:40 - 06:50 nothing to stop the ethnic cleansing that continues to escalate on the ground so the next year the UN establishes safe zones across the country to protect civilians flee in the war particularly Time: 06:50 - 07:00 bosniaks who were fleeing ethnic cleansing by the Serb armies but the UN is only as powerful as its member nations are willing to let them be and it turns out member nations are not Time: 07:00 - 07:10 willing to commit enough troops to actually fortify these safe zones Serb forces regularly show up and attack the civilians in these safe zones the United Time: 07:10 - 07:20 States who's still trying to stay out of this war helps negotiate peace between the croats and the bosniaks thus ending the war within the war they sign an agreement in March of 1994 Time: 07:20 - 07:30 re-establishing the federal republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and most importantly they renew their Alliance to fight against the serbs things slowly start to change in 1994. Bosnian serbs Time: 07:30 - 07:40 decline a peace deal offered by the U.N in response milosevic who's now feeling the consequences of being cut off from the global economy now Cuts ties with Time: 07:40 - 07:50 the Bosnian serbs refusing to send them more weapons and money he wants to remain in power controlling his new Yugoslavia in hopes that cutting ties Time: 07:50 - 08:00 with the Bosnian serps who are doing all these terrible things will convince the West to begin trading with him again so milosevich's support is now gone but even still the Bosnian serbs continue Time: 08:00 - 08:10 their campaign of horror committing atrocities all over the country but it's not just the serbs bosniaks and croats have also devolved into committing terrible violent human rights abuses Time: 08:10 - 08:20 against civilians as the war rages on NATO continues to enforce their no-fly zone shooting down a serp jet and getting more and more pulled into this conflict as Serb forces get Bolder Time: 08:20 - 08:30 former President Jimmy Carter travels to Bosnia and negotiates a four-month ceasefire it mostly holds with a few exceptions but the ceasefire expires Time: 08:30 - 08:40 they can't agree on a new one and the fighting starts again Serb forces are able to steal heavy weapons from the U.N and then use them to kill civilians NATO Time: 08:40 - 08:50 continues to ramp up air strikes Serb forces respond by taking U.N peacekeepers hostage and shooting down a usf-16 the Serb forces are feeling Time: 08:50 - 09:00 emboldened at this point they have consistently held around 70 percent of the land in Bosnia and even pushed back U.N peacekeepers without major consequences and they see an opportunity Time: 09:00 - 09:10 for one last big offensive to end the war and secure all of this land they just need to take over the UN safe zones kick the UN out and then take Sarajevo Time: 09:10 - 09:20 with overwhelming Force foreign [Music] Time: 09:20 - 09:30 izza a un safe Zone where nearly 10 000 bosniaks are seeking Refuge the UN had taken away their weapons they were totally unarmed but protected by U.N Time: 09:40 - 09:50 forces on July 11 1995 2000 Serb soldiers marched into the town they meet no resistance from the U.N soldiers who Time: 09:50 - 10:00 decided to maintain their neutrality and defend supplies and food for their refugees instead of the people themselves but these U.N soldiers were really just 370 Dutch soldiers they were Time: 10:00 - 10:10 outmatched anyway so some Retreat others are captured the Serb forces then Round Up 8 000 bosniak men and boys and then Time: 10:10 - 10:20 they systematically execute them comprising the deadliest genocide on European soil since World War II foreign Time: 10:20 - 10:30 the surviving refugees abandoned by the Time: 10:30 - 10:40 International Community flee the violence in cerebr they fled to other areas telling the stories of this mass murder the UN would later report that Time: 10:40 - 10:50 all sides violated the Geneva conventions but described this Serb offensive as quote systematic ethnic cleansing and at this point the United States can no longer stand by and watch Time: 10:50 - 11:00 this happen so in late 1995 the Clinton Administration pursues a new strategy they plan for the U.N to eventually pull out of Bosnia the U.S and NATO would Time: 11:00 - 11:10 keep them safe the plan also ensured that the U.S would be allowed to send weapons to the Bosnian government the U.S then proposed a peace plan one that divided Bosnia into two entities one for Time: 11:10 - 11:20 serbs and one for bosniaks these regions would have some autonomy and bosniaks would control 51 percent of the country both sides considered the US's plan but Time: 11:20 - 11:30 the fighting continued but now with the International Community squarely on their side the croats conduct a successful offensive in 1995 that takes Time: 11:30 - 11:40 back significant Land from the serbs and the bosniaks gain momentum in the war the balance of power is Shifting which forces the serbs back to the negotiating table to cut their losses after many Time: 11:40 - 11:50 rounds of negotiation and with the Serb forces seeing the tide of the war turn against them the Dayton Accords are signed in December 1995 by the Time: 11:50 - 12:00 presidents of Croatia Bosnia and Serbia on behalf of all of us who would come to see this peace take hold you have seen what war has wrought Time: 12:00 - 12:10 you know what peace can bring it was this agreement that eventually gave us these modern borders that divide the country into two you have the Federation Time: 12:10 - 12:20 of Bosnia and Herzegovina which is composed mostly of bosniaks and Bosnian croats and over here the Republica serpska composed mostly of Bosnian serbs Time: 12:20 - 12:30 which is somewhat independent with its own political system and its own Judiciary but it's still a part of Bosnia and Herzegovina so the war is over around a hundred thousand people Time: 12:30 - 12:40 died during this violence and many more Millions were forced to flee from their homes the majority of which were Bosnian Muslims a United Nations criminal tribunal eventually tried 161 people for Time: 12:40 - 12:50 various war crimes committed during this war Slobodan milosevic went to jail for the rest of his life because of his crimes against humanity his war crimes Time: 12:50 - 13:00 and genocide he died before the end of his trial the war reshaped this country solidifying the ethnic divides that had been at the root of the conflict today Time: 13:00 - 13:10 bosniak serbs and croats live in relative peace though the country faces new threats to that piece threats that are facing lots of parts of the world Time: 13:10 - 13:20 Rising nationalism a reverence for former Serb war criminals and more calls for Serb Independence the memory of the atrocities committed during this conflict still haunts this place both in Time: 13:20 - 13:30 the physical scars on the land but most powerfully in the bodies and minds of its people Time: 13:30 - 13:40 [Music] this is a complicated story and there Time: 13:40 - 13:50 are lots of feelings about it people watching this probably disagree with the way that I frame certain things but we did our best to be fair and factual and to give the best overview we could as I Time: 13:50 -

Lost two uncles and remember heading to a giant meadow with my mum to identify her sisters husbands. It was a terrible conflict. My late father walked during bombing raids to UN bread lines to collect food and water and walked it back. He told me you never ran during a bombing raid because you didn't know if you'd run right into a falling shell, so you just walked, getting showered in debris and moving from building to building to avoid sniper fire. He had some really messed up stories about his experience. Thank you Johnny for shedding light on this, it really means to world to everyone who experienced this awful war.",

03:10 ordinary maybe a little bit of irritable bowel issues but that's not what the doctors see this man looks like he has been poisoned but the lab technician didn't hand over Time: 03:10 - 03:20 any results that indicate that he was poisoned something is up the doctors go ahead and go with their instincts and treat him for poisoning because that is the symptoms that they are seeing they Time: 03:20 - 03:30 put him on a ventilator and they put him into a medically induced coma to recover over the next few days Alexia navalny is in the Intensive Care Unit in a coma in Time: 03:30 - 03:40 this hospital but the hospital starts to fill up not just with doctors but Russian government officials who start barring people like his wife and his Time: 03:40 - 03:50 personal doctor from entering the room navalny and his family do not feel safe in this hospital it's at this time that a German humanitarian non-profit organization offers to Charter a jet to Time: 03:50 - 04:00 fly him from this town in Russia out of Russia to be treated in Berlin soon he's on an airplane to Berlin where Time: 04:00 - 04:10 he arrives at a hospital and they run all of the same poison blood tests that they did in Russia but this time they find that he was poisoned Time: 04:10 - 04:20 this would have come up on the tests they did in Russia but somebody decided not to reveal that to the doctors Mr navalny reminds in an induced coma at a Berlin Hospital the German doctors are Time: 04:20 - 04:30 seeing that the poison that was somehow administered to Alexia navalny is some crazy nerve poison that sends the victim into a state of paralysis and gives Time: 04:30 - 04:40 nerve damage and inducing seizures and making their hearts slow down it's a poison that was developed by Soviet scientists during the Cold War Time: 04:40 - 04:50 and they used it to quietly attack people they wanted to get rid of like spies or double agents it's called novichok and it is a brutal poison and it was the poison that was used on Alexa Time: 04:50 - 05:00 navalny tonight this incredible story The most prominent Russian opposition leader is in a coma on a ventilator now there's a lot of ways to poison someone Time: 05:00 - 05:10 you can use ingredients that anyone has access to Nova chalk is something that is developed and used only by the Russian military and intelligence in a Time: 05:10 - 05:20 sense it's a signature so navalny goes back into a medically induced coma in this Hospital in Berlin where doctors are doing their best to treat him and also investigate what happened soon the Time: 05:20 - 05:30 world would know exactly what happened okay let's just pause for a second while Alexi navalny is in a coma in Berlin Time: 05:30 - 05:40 because we need to ask an important question which is who is this guy and why on Earth is Soviet nerve poison being used against him Time: 05:40 - 05:50 for most of his adult life Alexia navalny has been dedicated to one thing which is shining a light on how Russia really works behind the scenes not this Time: 05:50 - 06:00 or this but how it really works one thing you need to know about Russia is that the whole society the government the business structures everything is Time: 06:00 - 06:10 built on a giant house of cards let's say it's delicate it's fragile but it's the status quo and Putin is at the top Time: 06:10 - 06:20 from there you have the people closest to Putin's the ones that have his ear the rich Russian billionaires who control Russia's main industries like oil and gas mining telecoms all the Time: 06:20 - 06:30 richest guys in Russia these guys do favors for Putin and Putin does favors for them in the political sphere they scratch each other's back and in doing Time: 06:30 - 06:40 so they maintain control over everything that gets done in Russia and this model repeats itself as it trickles down to Regional governments and then to town and City governments who all operate in Time: 06:40 - 06:50 the same manner keeping the society stable through a culture of bribery secrecy and intimidation and it all happens in the name of keeping Putin Time: 06:50 - 07:00 secure in his position so that he can in turn keep his rich friends happy the reason why Putin fears Alexey navalny is because navalny wants all Russians to Time: 07:00 - 07:10 see exactly how this works to shine a light on it which could easily turn the people against the system to knock down Time: 07:10 - 07:20 this house of cards from the ground up to stop putting up with a government that works for the rich corporate owners and not for the people and if this happens it's Vladimir Putin who has the Time: 07:20 - 07:30 longest hardest fall okay but here's the juiciest part of the story and the part that got me into this and that I love which is that the tactics navalny uses Time: 07:30 - 07:40 to do this shine a light on the system thing there's no better way to describe it than saying he's full on trolling Vladimir Putin and his friends Time: 07:40 - 07:50 he does this in a lot of ways but what I love the most are his well-produced internet explainer documentaries Time: 07:50 - 08:00 he makes these long videos exposing the indulgent Corruption of Russian billionaires who control the country and he uses these visual investigation Time: 08:00 - 08:10 techniques that are really stunning to look at and really convincing but there's also a good amount of snarky poking fun in every one of these videos like this deep dive into the corruption Time: 08:10 - 08:20 of this Russian politician that starts with this goofy iPhone video of him awkwardly dancing at like a wedding or something but it's not just all poking fun these Time: 08:20 - 08:30 videos then go very deep and they reveal really useful and compelling evidence that shows just how bad this situation Time: 08:30 - 08:40 is just how in bed the government is with these rich billionaires but always peppered with a good amount of this [Music] Time: 08:40 - 08:50 he's like a viral internet sensation meets like hardcore journalist activist video vlogger guy I just he's like just Time: 08:50 - 09:00 an interesting character so what is navalny he's kind of a politician but he's more than that his specific policy agenda has morph and it's honestly like not that Noble like he totally supported Time: 09:00 - 09:10 the annexation of Crimea which is like totally off limits and a terrible thing that happened and his electability as a leader isn't very likely but that's not Time: 09:10 - 09:20 really at the heart of his mission his mission isn't about being elected it's about dismantling the current system not to convince people to vote for him but simply get people to vote against Putin Time: 09:20 - 09:30 and the status quo and here's why this scares the shift out of Vladimir Putin back to our house of cards even though Putin is at the top of this pyramid it Time: 09:30 - 09:40 doesn't mean he's all-powerful he's not like a standard totalitarian dictator who just has everyone under his thumb he's only powerful because he's in the good graces of all these Super Rich guys Time: 09:40 - 09:50 guys that own the massive companies of gas telecoms Mining and natural resources in Russia if these guys turn on him he's over Putin while powerful is Time: 09:50 - 10:00 simply one Cog in the machine of keeping these guys powerful and immune from laws and regulation Putin isn't afraid that Time: 10:00 - 10:10 all these YouTube videos are going to create legal issues for Putin and his friends the courts in Russia are just as influenced by this culture of bribery and intimidation as everything else he's Time: 10:10 - 10:20 not afraid of that instead he's afraid that the people might realize that their government is controlled by a bunch of billionaires and start demanding that Time: 10:20 - 10:30 Russia be more transparent [Music] some accountability for these rich dudes and the leaders that support them like I Time: 10:30 - 10:40 said if that happens these billionaires might be able to slip into the shadows and run away to some other country but Putin will be the public face of the person who's kept this Arrangement Time: 10:40 - 10:50 together he will be Enemy Number One his fault will be the greatest that is why he's afraid in a sense he's painted himself into a corner and he's past the point of no return he must maintain the Time: 10:50 - 11:00 current system or he will face the wrath of his people so far the only person who has actually garnered that wrath is a Lexi navalny how corrupt do you think is Time: 11:00 - 11:10 Mr Vladimir Putin he is the basement of this corruption he's personally involved in corruption and he's encouraging our official for corruption Time: 11:10 - 11:20 it's his wave of ruling country Vladimir Putin made his first visit since Russia annexed Crimea Vladimir Putin casts his shadow across the boundary of Europe and Time: 11:20 - 11:30 Russia so Putin goes to greater and greater lengths to ensure that he remains popular among his people and show the billionaires that he's still the right Time: 11:30 - 11:40 guy to keep this system of corruption going he does this in a few ways the first way he keeps popularity among his people is my favorite and it looks like this Time: 11:40 - 11:50 [Music] he stages these absurd photo ops where he's like surveying the land on a horse with no shirt or playing hockey with a Time: 11:50 - 12:00 bunch of literal professional hockey players from Russia and he's actually better than all of them and he scores eight goals in the course of this video it's amazing Time: 12:00 - 12:10 [Music] and people actually buy this they like to see their leader like super powerful Time: 12:10 - 12:20 and then secondly he keeps his people happy by actually leading the country in ways people like his approval rating remains quite High Time: 12:20 - 12:30 but more and more as Putin and this house of cards feels threatened Putin is resorting to more extreme means to keep Time: 12:30 - 12:40 this system Okay so we got the backstory on Russia and Alexi Time: 12:40 - 12:50 navalny let's get back to Berlin to the hospital to the ICU where Alexia navalny is in a coma he finally comes out of this coma and by Time: 12:50 - 13:00 then the world has looked into the details of him being poisoned on this airplane and it becomes clear that this is the work of Russian government agents Time: 13:00 - 13:10 who snuck into his hotel and laced his underwear with this lethal nerve poison Alexia navalny is the master of trolling Time: 13:10 - 13:20 and pranking and he immediately responds to this he downloads some basic call spoofing software that any of us could download and he masks his number as a Time: 13:20 - 13:30 number coming from an intelligence secure line and he calls an intelligence agent who is has covet and is like ditched out in his house at seven in the Time: 13:30 - 13:40 morning he's like delirious and he goes on to pretend that he is a leader in the intelligence agency he has all this Insider information and he teases out a Time: 13:40 - 13:50 confession from this intelligence agent that indeed they were the ones behind this poisoning [Music] Time: 13:50 - 14:00 I'm not going to play a bunch of that phone call here but I'm going to put a link in the description and you need to go listen to it because it is insane to Time: 14:00 - 14:10 listen to so what's navalny's next move he's in Berlin he almost got killed he's now having to learn to walk again because the nerve poison like really effed him up what does he do he decides Time: 14:10 - 14:20 to do exactly what he's always done instead of cower and stay abroad he decides to return to Russia to face Putin head-on upon his return He Time: 14:20 - 14:30 releases a documentary that is his most epic documentary yet he was working on it before he got poisoned this one focuses entirely on Putin and his Time: 14:30 - 14:40 network of bribes cronyism and loads of amazing Drone footage of Putin's lavish Palace on the Black Sea in true navalny fashion he makes it clear that he's going to release the film after he Time: 14:40 - 14:50 returns to Moscow because in his words Time: 14:50 - 15:00 foreign the documentary becomes one of the most instantly viral videos ever to appear on Time: 15:00 - 15:10 the YouTube platform it currently has 110 million views my favorite part of this dock is when Nevada's team goes to the shores of the Black Sea they blow up Time: 15:10 - 15:20 this inflatable boat and then they get a drone in the air and they fly over this giant Palace on the shores of the Black Sea and then they do what I love which is animation on top of Drone footage to Time: 15:20 - 15:30 help expose a crazy story they start to pick apart every aspect of this Palace they get the original blueprints to show that there's a hockey rink in the Time: 15:30 - 15:40 basement there's a full casino and all of this for the benefit of the president of the country but of course it's not owned by the president it's owned by his Time: 15:40 - 15:50 buddies some rich billionaire dude actually owns it but who actually benefits from it Putin it's like a symbol of the whole Russian system in one drone shot it's freaking beautiful Time: 15:50 - 16:00 no political leader should have a palace like this Alexi navalny who return to Moscow for the first time since he was poisoned last summer navalny lands in Time: 16:00 - 16:10 Moscow and what happens he's immediately arrested on What charges Well they claimed that he was violating parole from some old fake set Time: 16:10 - 16:20 of charges brought against him years ago that were thrown out later they were totally fake and yet the Russian State continued to say that he had to report for parole turns out he couldn't report Time: 16:20 - 16:30 to parole officers because he was in a coma from being poisoned by the Russian government and yet he gets arrested he'd only been back on Russian soil a few Time: 16:30 - 16:40 minutes when Alexander was told he was being detained I should kiss goodbye for his wife Julia Russia's justice system has been a sham Time: 16:40 - 16:50 for a long time this isn't new but just how blatant this is how clearly faked all of this is to silence a threat Time: 16:50 - 17:00 to the leader that's a new low for Russia and its justice system so navalny is arrested and put on trial the people take to the streets of Moscow Time: 17:00 - 17:10 and around the country the police meet them with Force arresting over a thousand protesters and now arresting journalists here's a clip of navalny's lawyer speaking openly to the media in Time: 17:10 - 17:20 the middle of Moscow and out of nowhere a group of policemen come detain her [Music] Time: 17:20 - 17:30 just like in broad daylight while the protesters clashed with the police outside the courthouse navalny stands in a glass cage while a largely politically Time: 17:30 - 17:40 motivated sham trial about parole violation takes place his wife Yulia is in the courtroom in the audience watching this all happen they're making Time: 17:40 - 17:50 eye contact and in the end the system does what it's supposed to do navalny gets two years and eight months of prison time the House of Cards stays Time: 17:50 - 18:00 stable for at least a little longer oh it is this movement was never about Alexia Time: 18:00 - 18:10 navalny or his politics and it likely never will be he will never be the leader of Russia his role in all of this is focused on one thing showing the people how their Time: 18:10 - 18:20 country really works ripping away the curtain that veils how their government uses the resources of the people and who Time: 18:20 - 18:30 it serves and who it doesn't doing so threatens the security of Vladimir Putin and his friends which is why the system is reacting Time: 18:30 - 18:40 going to greater and greater lengths to muzzle navalny and anyone like him the question for me is how far will this go how much is too Time: 18:40 - 18:50 much before the Russian people decide to take back their country [Music] Time: 18:50 -

00:40 middle of the night these are the troops hundreds of thousands of them that had been camped out on the border for months troops that putin had insisted were Time: 00:40 - 00:50 there for a routine military exercise and that the u.s and uk intel swore were actually preparing to invade many around the world including in Time: 00:50 - 01:00 ukraine thought that this was just the west being dramatic stoking the tensions but the intel was exactly right Time: 01:00 - 01:10 most of those troops crossed the border last week and are now inside the country Time: 01:10 - 01:20 russian military vehicles including tanks entering ukraine the invasion the attack that russia promised would never Time: 01:20 - 01:30 happen has now started the country is being attacked from all directions hours after this invasion started in the Time: 01:30 - 01:40 middle of the night on thursday morning ukraine's president zielinski appeared on tv not just to talk to his people but to speak directly to russians Time: 01:40 - 01:50 themselves we share a border of over 2 000 kilometers and along this border your Time: 01:50 - 02:00 troops are stationed almost 200 000 soldiers your leaders just approved them to make a step towards us into the territory of another country Time: 02:00 - 02:10 this step is likely the beginning of a massive war on the european continent russia again warned its nuclear forces Time: 02:10 - 02:20 were on high alert several cities were hit in residential areas resulting in dozens of civilian deaths this is a war unlike any war the world Time: 02:20 - 02:30 has ever seen it looks like a war from like 1830 but it's happening in 2022 putin's army is much stronger than Time: 02:30 - 02:40 ukraine's at least in terms of numbers if he really wants to he probably is going to be able to take over the country's major population centers and oust the ukrainian government the u.s Time: 02:40 - 02:50 and nato can't send troops for fear of starting a clash between two nuclear nations something we simply do not do it's a red line that no one crosses Time: 02:50 - 03:00 i want to tell you exactly why vladimir putin and his army are here the story behind this invasion is the story of this one man's worldview but it's also a Time: 03:00 - 03:10 story of a bet that he took a bet that ukrainians would give up lay down their arms and see the world the way he does Time: 03:10 - 03:20 but if there's anything i have learned in the past week it's that even if putin conquers a big portion of this country something he has the military hardware to do even if he does that he still Time: 03:20 - 03:30 won't win this war in fact i'm here to argue that he's already lost there are big explosions taking place in kiev right Time: 03:30 - 03:40 now people here are going to be waking up to a very different country than the one they went to sleep we are getting this non-stop reports of Time: 03:40 - 03:50 attacks and russian strikes from all across the country Time: 03:50 - 04:00 [Music] vladimir putin has already lost this war and to understand what i'm talking about Time: 04:00 - 04:10 you have to look at two things number one what putin said right before the invasion and number two what actually happened once he invaded Time: 04:10 - 04:20 i want to show you both [Music] so a few days before the invasion putin gets on tv and addresses the nation Time: 04:20 - 04:30 [Music] it's this unsurprising hour-long history lecture where putin lays out his grand Time: 04:30 - 04:40 intricate argument as to why ukraine in fact isn't a real country Time: 04:40 - 04:50 [Music] instead ukraine was created by the authors of the russian communist revolution 100 years ago and now ukraine Time: 04:50 - 05:00 this invented country that's just an extension of russia itself has been hijacked by the u.s and europe who have installed neo-nazi thugs to run the show Time: 05:00 - 05:10 seriously he said all of this you can go watch the hour-long lecture if you want according to his story the west did this to eventually force Time: 05:10 - 05:20 ukraine into their military alliance called nato which they will use to defeat russia just like and seriously he says this just like hitler did 80 years Time: 05:20 - 05:30 ago but this time putin will make sure that russia is ready for the invasion oh gosh there is a lot to unpack here Time: 05:30 - 05:40 the neo-nazi thug thing i will get to that in a second but the message was clear putin was basically like ukraine if you're gonna disavow communist russia Time: 05:40 - 05:50 and all of the things that it gave to you you don't deserve the land that you got from communist russia and in fact all of this land still belongs to russia and we're going to take it back Time: 05:50 - 06:00 [Music] Time: 06:00 - 06:10 but this warped historical framing of who rightfully owns this land isn't quite enough to justify an invasion Time: 06:10 - 06:20 maybe in like 1860 or something but not today so putin needs to really emphasize the villains in his story so he makes a Time: 06:20 - 06:30 big part of his story this idea that ukraine this fake country is being run by american-backed anti- russian neo-nazis who are holding Time: 06:30 - 06:40 the ukrainian people hostages Time: 06:40 - 06:50 okay okay it's easy to poke fun at like the delusion of vladimir putin but let's talk about the facts here and what putin Time: 06:50 - 07:00 is actually basing this off of because it really matters for understanding why he went in and why he's gonna lose first let's just clear up the fact that Time: 07:00 - 07:10 ukraine wasn't invented by russia kiev the capital of ukraine was a thriving city long before moscow was even on the map ukraine has a very old culture but Time: 07:10 - 07:20 what putin has done is twisted modern history to make a claim that ukraine actually isn't a legitimate country and he does this because it's a very key Time: 07:20 - 07:30 part of his story one that supports the second major argument which is that ukraine is run by neo- nazis who want to exterminate the russian-speaking population so let's get the facts here Time: 07:30 - 07:40 within ukraine there is indeed a faction of far-right neo-nazis who have a political party and a militia force and this militia force has actually joined Time: 07:40 - 07:50 the ukrainian army in the past eight years to fight russia back from annexing any more territory in the east of the country you may have remembered that Time: 07:50 - 08:00 russia took over a big part of ukraine called crimea eight years ago ukrainian forces have set up a perimeter but it's clear that we are completely Time: 08:00 - 08:10 surrounded by russian forces yeah these neo-nazi fighters sort of nationalist guys came up as a resistance to that and yeah putin's got one thing right these are not good people these are literal Time: 08:10 - 08:20 neo-nazi white supremacist soldiers that commit all sorts of atrocities and train children in their ideology and fighting tactics Time: 08:20 - 08:30 [Music] so yeah putin i get it these are bad people neo-nazis we don't like them but putin is claiming that these are the Time: 08:30 - 08:40 people running the country running ukraine when in fact if you look at the data from the 2019 election in ukraine you'll see that the country's ultra-nationalist far-right coalition Time: 08:40 - 08:50 gained barely over two percent of the vote and zero seats in the parliament they are a small group of extremely fringe far right fighters that putin has Time: 08:50 - 09:00 latched on to oh and there's a more obvious bit of data here which is that the ukrainian president is jewish and has family who died in the holocaust ukraine is not run by neo-nazis listen Time: 09:00 - 09:10 to balance my view on this because i'm in the west and i'm getting all western media i have actually been watching Time: 09:10 - 09:20 russian state tv to like see what the narrative is on their side and i can tell you that they actually believe that the country is run by nazis it is Time: 09:20 - 09:30 reminiscent of the practices and methods of nazi germany and we're seeing a full revival of nazism and fascism in ukraine i've tried to dig into this to try to Time: 09:30 - 09:40 understand like is there more like meat on the bone here no there's not a fringe group of militiamen in the far east are what putin is basing this off of over Time: 09:40 - 09:50 here in reality land ukraine is a nation of 44 million people with its own culture that is thousands of years old it is a country where fewer and fewer people like russia in fact it's a Time: 09:50 - 10:00 country that ousted the pro-russian leader in 2014 [Music] the people don't want russia and putin Time: 10:00 - 10:10 anymore they've moved on but all of these facts are explained away very conveniently by putin's bigger conspiracy which is that it's actually outside forces that are pulling the Time: 10:10 - 10:20 strings and that the people of ukraine have been brainwashed by the west and yet there is one thing that putin is absolutely right about Time: 10:20 - 10:30 [Music] Time: 10:30 - 10:40 these two countries are deeply connected through culture and language and history and exchange a war against ukrainians Time: 10:40 - 10:50 would not sit well with the russian people and this explains why putin needs to frame the war in a very certain way not an invasion to take over a sovereign Time: 10:50 - 11:00 nation of russia's brothers and sisters but rather a rescue effort to save the ukrainian people from these aggressive villains who are really controlling the Time: 11:00 - 11:10 country Time: 11:10 - 11:20 okay i'm about to jump into the maps and look at how the war is actually playing out and help us understand it but i Time: 11:20 - 11:30 really really want us to keep in mind putin's story because it really will make everything click so let's just go over it really quickly putin's story is really four things number one ukraine Time: 11:30 - 11:40 really belongs to russia number two it has been hijacked by the us and europe i.e the west number three the west is controlling ukraine with its neo-nazi puppets also that the west military Time: 11:40 - 11:50 alliance called nato can use ukraine as a bridge to get to russia who they want to defeat and all of this leads to putin Time: 11:50 - 12:00 must invade to free ukrainians and protect russia from the west that is it that is the justification that vladimir putin has been building Time: 12:00 - 12:10 minutes after this second address last week where he laid out all of his justifications in the middle of the night the rockets start flying and the tanks start rolling Time: 12:20 - 12:30 [Music] Time: 12:30 - 12:40 and this is how it started what is becoming the most consequential war in europe since world war ii a pretend Time: 12:40 - 12:50 rescue effort framed as an operation to denotify the country russia comes in from all sides quickly taking over mostly rural areas but slowly moving Time: 12:50 - 13:00 towards the major cities the country is being attacked from all directions some of those russian troops are heading here to the capital in addition to tanks and troops taking over land russia also Time: 13:00 - 13:10 starts firing missiles that hit targets all throughout the country this has come out of nowhere who resist oh i tell you what i just heard a big bang Time: 13:10 - 13:20 right here the invasion the attack that russia promised would never happen has now started Time: 13:20 - 13:30 people who live in kiev are sleeping in underground subway stations it's the only place they feel safe ukrainians fled to basements to bomb shelters some people are adjusting to this new reality Time: 13:30 - 13:40 of living in a country now a war hundreds of thousands fled to the borders west of the country looking for safety others are taking trains to the Time: 13:40 - 13:50 west to get out of the country they are fleeing into neighboring countries like moldova romania and poland at the city's central train station a frantic dash as all of these people tried Time: 13:50 - 14:00 but wait remember putin's story according to this story after this initial invasion ukrainians were going Time: 14:00 - 14:10 to wake up from their slumber and welcome him with open arms the neo-nazi president was gonna flee and ukraine would be returned to russia putin Time: 14:10 - 14:20 becoming the savior of the russian motherland but that is exactly what didn't happen outgunned and outnumbered ukrainian soldiers and civilians alike Time: 14:20 - 14:30 are mounting a stiff resistance i used to teach maths and physics but two days ago the russian army took control of my town so i signed up to fight every day ukrainians are taking to the streets to Time: 14:30 - 14:40 fight for their homeland those russian shits come here she says we are ready to greet them we are ready to fight Time: 14:40 - 14:50 and like fights like hell this is my city this is my land i have to protect it you do not feel they're going to succeed in taking out your administration and your government no Time: 14:50 - 15:00 way as they will never take the response of ukrainians both military and civilian is where putin's story starts to crumble the entire world is Time: 15:00 - 15:10 witnessing the determined and brave resistance by the ukrainian army and population i have never seen ukraine said united and Time: 15:10 - 15:20 as for the president of ukraine the alleged neo-nazi drug addict thug puppet of the west well the u.s actually offered to airlift him out of the Time: 15:20 - 15:30 country for his own safety instead of taking the offer his response was quote the fight is here i need ammunition not a ride which by the way that quote has Time: 15:30 - 15:40 been turned into a t-shirt that you can buy on amazon ukrainians are fighting for love of country russians are fighting out of a fear of a dictator in Time: 15:40 - 15:50 the event of russia opting for escalation ukraine will defend itself he then sent a video around to the country of him in central kiev Time: 15:50 - 16:00 making it known that he is staying he is fighting so despite being totally outmatched militarily ukrainians are fighting back showing that the outcome Time: 16:00 - 16:10 of a war is as much determined by the courage and patriotism of the population as it is by the number of missiles and troops that you have Time: 16:10 - 16:20 [Music] Time: 16:20 - 16:30 i've been talking to people inside Time: 16:30 - 16:40 ukraine and seeing this devotion firsthand how is morale right now among you and among the people you're talking to honestly extremely exciting Time: 16:40 - 16:50 ukrainians aren't letting this conquest happen and in doing so they are turning putin's argument his story on its head and foiling what appears to be his Time: 16:50 - 17:00 initial strategy for wrangling ukraine back into his sphere of influence one ukrainian i talked to said that there's a waiting list for the ukrainian army our original defense won't accept any Time: 17:00 - 17:10 more people because it's packed the queues are growing you cannot you even get in right now men volunteering to fight molotov cocktails for those who Time: 17:10 - 17:20 want to fight but don't have a gun it's a tweet from the ukrainian defense ministry to prepare molotov cocktails to throw at the occupiers well i'm here in Time: 17:20 - 17:30 order to protect my family my country there is an incredible sense of unity here the morale is very high okay this sounds all positive and it is but this is still war Time: 17:30 - 17:40 and putin can still conquer a lot of land he can take over major cities install a puppet government and be the new ruler of ukraine he has the military Time: 17:40 - 17:50 to do it and he seems to have the tolerance for bloodshed he seems to believe in his fantasy story so much that he's gonna keep up this crusade but Time: 17:50 - 18:00 i'm here to tell you that putin has already lost this war Time: 18:00 - 18:10 i mean let's play this out so i can show you what i mean let's say putin keeps going he keeps sending troops in and missiles despite all of this resistance he could eventually take over the major Time: 18:10 - 18:20 population centers including the capital kiev all of this with the same goal that he's had the whole time which is getting the ukrainians to give up and realize Time: 18:20 - 18:30 that russia is actually the country they want to align with he's also kind of hoping that maybe the ukrainian military will come to their senses and take over the government and negotiate with putin Time: 18:30 - 18:40 but let's say they never do they probably won't instead they keep doing what they've been doing for the last week resisting defending condemning and broadcasting all of it to the world on Time: 18:40 - 18:50 the internet so putin has no choice but to drive the government out and install a pro-russian regime in order to do this he's going to need a massive military Time: 18:50 - 19:00 presence to keep control of these cities and their people it's now costing him tens of billions of dollars and crippling his economy which by the way Time: 19:00 - 19:10 is only like the size of texas i mean one of the biggest knocks on putin's plan is the sheer size of ukraine let's zoom out and realize that ukraine is Time: 19:10 - 19:20 huge it's the biggest country in europe if you don't count russia the giant country that extends into asia occupying this entire land mass would be basically impossible for russia so you have a map Time: 19:20 - 19:30 that maybe looks something like this which gives plenty of space for ukrainians to gather and mount their resistance giving russia hell for an indefinite Time: 19:30 - 19:40 period of time meanwhile back home in russia they've now seen the imagery from the ground they now see that putin's story justifying this invasion is total Time: 19:40 - 19:50 bs there's no nazis there's no brainwashing of the people instead in this scenario russians are thinking of deaths of our ukrainian brothers and sisters while also destroying the russian economy almost every russian has Time: 19:50 - 20:00 someone from ukraine either a friend or a relative or a colleague this is a war between brother nations protesters in Time: 20:00 - 20:10 the streets demonstrating against vladimir putin's invasion of ukraine on top of all of that the rich Time: 20:10 - 20:20 russian business guys who keep putin in power the oligarchs they aren't happy because the entire world has cut russia off russian billionaires moving their Time: 20:20 - 20:30 yachts scrambling their jets and shifting their assets to prepare for a possible crackdown they can't access their financial reserves their ability to move money is made much more difficult people aren't letting their Time: 20:30 - 20:40 trade vessels into ports new efforts by u.s law enforcement to make russian oligarchs feel the pain of putin's war i mean this is effectively what sanctions Time: 20:40 - 20:50 do so the oligarchs are now like dude putin wtf and they put pressure on him to stop this madness but even still putin has enough power that he could still dig in his heels and keep trying Time: 20:50 - 21:00 to get ukrainians to come under his rule but by this point ukrainians are done with putin they see his true colors anyone who was on the fence before has Time: 21:00 - 21:10 now witnessed civilians being killed in putin's war of choice they won't come on his side now the upshot here is that there's not really a scenario where putin keeps going and gets what he wants Time: 21:10 - 21:20 and that's because the story that he based this invasion off of is proving to be totally wrong all of these assumptions that he predicated his war Time: 21:20 - 21:30 on turned out to be the delusions of a pseudo-history buff stuck in the logic of the cold war not the realities on the ground today at another point to the Time: 21:30 - 21:40 against putin camp meanwhile putin's war has united the west and nato like never before nato has a new sense of purpose a new thing to rally around something they've been looking for since the end Time: 21:40 - 21:50 of the cold war and ukraine who is currently getting tons of support and weapons and money and aid and refugee support from nato countries is now way Time: 21:50 - 22:00 more likely to sympathize with the west because now they've seen the realities of what putin has to offer which is falsehoods and unprovoked conflict all in the name of some ill-defined vision Time: 22:00 - 22:10 of former imperial glory nope it's my city it's my hometown it's my homeland it's my country and i'm not the Time: 22:10 - 22:20 one who should live the russians are the ones who should live russia is a great nation full of beautiful culture geography history and people the vast Time: 22:20 - 22:30 majority of those people don't want imperial style expansion and war they want to live their lives to prosper to connect and yet Time: 22:30 - 22:40 the warped delusional world view of one greedy man has cut off their ability to do that how is that possible the russian people have no say in the Time: 22:40 - 22:50 behavior of their government under the putin dictatorship these incredibly brave people often young people in russia who are out on the streets Time: 22:50 - 23:00 protesting against what their president is doing this is not the war by the people of russia it says yet another military adventure by the unaccountable Time: 23:00 - 23:10 unelected increasingly deranged dictator in a kremlin by the name of vladimir this situation is developing and certainly will take paths that no one Time: 23:10 - 23:20 can predict by the time you're watching this i'm sure some key development has happened that i haven't covered here but i feel pretty certain when i say that putin really doesn't have a path to the Time: 23:20 - 23:30 victory that he set out to achieve last week when he sent people and weapons across his border to attack his neighbors ukrainians with their bold courage have proved him wrong i know Time: 23:30 - 23:40 that sounds very poetic and maybe even cliche but in this case it's true if someone told me a week ago i would own an assault rifle i would not believe so Time: 23:40 - 23:50 now the world will stand by and support as they continue to wage this battle for the future of their land land that belongs to them not to a russian dictator Time: 23:50 - 24:00 [Music] for everyone to know it's our land it's our home we will defend it 13 ukrainian border guards defiantly telling and Time: 24:00 - 24:10 invading russian warship to go f yourself when asked to surrender and we will win russian ship go [ __ ] yourself Time: 24:10 - 24:20 before you go i want to tell you about two things that are important number one i want to give money to the relief effort in ukraine Time: 24:30 - 24:40 there's a lot of need right now i'm running a fundraiser where i'm going to match donations up to ten thousand dollars information in the description number two i need to thank today's sponsor who made this video possible Time: 24:40 -

And while Putin has done a lot to try to bypass the major pipelines going through Ukraine (which\ncosts him a lot to have to use) to get oil and gas to the rest of Europe, a fully developed Ukrainian petro-\nstate would be a massive threat to the already fragile petro-state economy of Russia, especially at a point\nwhere pretty much all of Nato would LOVE to be able to not need to funnel money to the Kremlin for their\nresource needs.

      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:10 - [Reporter] President Biden considering deploying thousands of troops to Eastern Europe. - There are now 100,000 troops on the Eastern border of Ukraine. Time: 00:10 - 00:20 Russia is setting up field hospitals on this border. Like this is what preparation for war looks like. A legitimate war. - Ukrainian troops are watching and waiting, Time: 00:20 - 00:30 saying they are preparing for a fight. - The U.S. has ordered the families of embassy staff to leave Ukraine. Britain has sent all of their non-essential staff home. Time: 00:30 - 00:40 And now the U.S. is sending tons of weapons and munitions to Ukraine's army. And we're even considering deploying our own troops to the region. Time: 00:40 - 00:50 I mean, this thing is heating up. Meanwhile, Russia and the West have been in Geneva and Brussels trying to talk it out, and sort of getting nowhere. - The message is very clear. Time: 00:50 - 01:00 Should Russia take further aggressive actions against Ukraine the costs will be severe and the consequences serious. - It's a scary, grim momentum that is unpredictable. Time: 01:00 - 01:10 And the chances of miscalculation and escalation are growing. I want to explain what's going on here, Time: 01:10 - 01:20 but I want to show you that this isn't just typical geopolitical behavior. Stuff that can just be explained on the map. Instead, to understand why 100,000 troops are camped out Time: 01:20 - 01:30 on Ukraine's Eastern border, ready for war, you have to understand Russia and how it's been cut down over the ages from the Slavic empire that dominated this whole region Time: 01:30 - 01:40 to then the Soviet Union, which was defeated in the nineties. And what you really have to understand here is how that history is transposed Time: 01:40 - 01:50 onto the brain of one man. This guy, Vladimir Putin. This is a story about regional domination and struggles between big powers, Time: 01:50 - 02:00 but really it's the story about what Vladimir Putin really wants. - [Reporter] Russian troops moving swiftly to take control of military bases in Crimea. - [Reporter] Russia has amassed more than 100,000 troops Time: 02:00 - 02:10 and a lot of military hardware at the border with Ukraine. (dramatic music) Time: 02:10 - 02:20 - Before we go any further, I want to say thank you to today's sponsor, which is BetterHelp. BetterHelp is a platform that allows you to access therapy. I'm a major fan of therapy. Time: 02:20 - 02:30 I've been doing it for over two years now, and it has changed my entire world. I really believe that therapy is over stigmatized Time: 02:30 - 02:40 and not accessible to people. And BetterHelp is trying to change that, which I really believe in and support. With BetterHelp you can quickly sign up and you take a little quiz Time: 02:40 - 02:50 and it connects you to a network of thousands and thousands of professionals who you can start talking with today. There are a variety of experts Time: 02:50 - 03:00 in different fields of therapy within BetterHelp's network. So you can find somebody who is right for you. And for me, I didn't have any particular specific issue Time: 03:00 - 03:10 that I was going to therapy for. I just started therapy, and I realized that it was just incredibly helpful to have someone to talk to and to learn how to express my feelings Time: 03:10 - 03:20 and to learn how to talk about what was happening inside of my brain. BetterHelp is not a crisis line. It's not self-help. It is licensed, legitimate, professional therapists Time: 03:20 - 03:30 who you connect with over the internet, securely. Which is great because therapy is usually really hard to figure out where's the right therapist. Time: 03:30 - 03:40 How do I get in, how do I book it? All of that is usually very difficult, at least in my experience. And so BetterHelp is making it easier. So if you want to try this out, you can get 10% off your first month of BetterHelp Time: 03:40 - 03:50 by going to the link in my description. Thank you, BetterHelp for supporting my channel, for supporting this work. Let's dive back in. Okay. Let's get up to speed on what's happening here. Time: 03:50 - 04:00 And I'm just going to quickly give you the highlight version of like the news that's happening, because I want to get into the juicy part, which is like why, the roots of all of this. Time: 04:00 - 04:10 So let's go. A few months ago, Russia started sending more and more troops to this border. It's this massive border between Ukraine and Russia. Time: 04:10 - 04:20 They said they were doing a military exercise, but the rest of the world was like, \"Yeah, we totally believe you Russia. Pshaw.\" This was right before this big meeting where North American and European countries Time: 04:20 - 04:30 were coming together to talk about a lot of different things, like these countries often do in these diplomatic summits. But soon, because of Russia's aggressive behavior Time: 04:30 - 04:40 coming in and setting up 100,000 troops on the border with Ukraine, the entire summit turned into a whole, \"W-T-F Russia, what are you doing on the border of Ukraine,\" meeting. Time: 04:40 - 04:50 Before the meeting Putin comes out and says, \"Listen, I have some demands for the West.\" And everyone's like, \"Okay, Russia, what are your demands? Time: 04:50 - 05:00 You know, we have like, COVID-19 right now. And like, that's like surging. So like, we don't need your like, bluster about what your demands are.\" And Putin's like, \"No, here's my list of demands.\" Time: 05:00 - 05:10 Putin's demands for the summit were this: number one, that NATO, which is this big military alliance between U.S., Canada, and Europe stop expanding, Time: 05:10 - 05:20 meaning they don't let any new members in, okay. So, Russia is like, \"No more new members to your, like, Time: 05:20 - 05:30 cool military club that I don't like. You can't have any more members.\" Number two, that NATO withdraw all of their troops from anywhere in Eastern Europe. Time: 05:30 - 05:40 Basically Putin is saying, \"I can veto any military cooperation or troops going between countries that have to do with Eastern Europe, the place that used to be the Soviet Union.\" Time: 05:40 - 05:50 Okay, and number three, Putin demands that America vow not to protect its allies in Eastern Europe with nuclear weapons. \"L-O-L,\" said all of the other countries, Time: 05:50 - 06:00 \"You're literally nuts, Vladimir Putin. Like these are the most ridiculous demands, ever.\" But there he is, Putin, with these demands. Time: 06:00 - 06:10 These very, very aggressive demands. And he sort of is implying that if his demands aren't met, he's going to invade Ukraine. I mean, it doesn't work like this. This is not how international relations work. Time: 06:10 - 06:20 You don't just show up and say like, \"I'm not gonna allow other countries to join your alliance because it makes me feel uncomfortable.\" But what I love about this list of demands from Vladimir Putin for this summit Time: 06:20 - 06:30 is that it gives us a clue on what Vladimir Putin really wants. What he's after here. You read them closely and you can grasp his intentions. But to grasp those intentions Time: 06:30 - 06:40 you have to understand what NATO is. and what Russia and Ukraine used to be. (dramatic music) Okay, so a while back I made this video about why Russia is so damn big, Time: 06:40 - 06:50 where I explain how modern day Russia started here in Kiev, which is actually modern day Ukraine. In other words, modern day Russia, as we know it, Time: 06:50 - 07:00 has its original roots in Ukraine. These places grew up together and they eventually became a part of the same mega empire called the Soviet Union. Time: 07:00 - 07:10 They were deeply intertwined, not just in their history and their culture, but also in their economy and their politics. So it's after World War II, Time: 07:10 - 07:20 it's like the '50s, '60s, '70s, and NATO was formed, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. This was a military alliance between all of these countries, Time: 07:20 - 07:30 that was meant to sort of deter the Soviet Union from expanding and taking over the world. But as we all know, the Soviet Union, which was Russia and all of these other countries, Time: 07:30 - 07:40 collapsed in 1991. And all of these Soviet republics, including Ukraine, became independent, meaning they were not now a part of one big block of countries anymore. Time: 07:40 - 07:50 But just because the border's all split up, it doesn't mean that these cultural ties actually broke. Like for example, the Soviet leader at the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union, this guy, Gorbachev, Time: 07:50 - 08:00 he was the son of a Ukrainian mother and a Russian father. Like he grew up with his mother singing him Ukrainian folk songs. Time: 08:00 - 08:10 In his mind, Ukraine and Russia were like one thing. So there was a major reluctance to accept Ukraine as a separate thing from Russia. Time: 08:10 - 08:20 In so many ways, they are one. There was another Russian at the time who did not accept this new division. This young intelligence officer, Vladimir Putin, who was starting to rise up in the ranks Time: 08:20 - 08:30 of post-Soviet Russia. There's this amazing quote from 2005 where Putin is giving this state-of-the- union-like address, Time: 08:30 - 08:40 where Putin declares the collapse of the Soviet Union, quote, \"The greatest catastrophe of the 20th century. And as for the Russian people, it became a genuine tragedy. Time: 08:40 - 08:50 Tens of millions of fellow citizens and countrymen found themselves beyond the fringes of Russian territory.\" Time: 08:50 - 09:00 Do you see how he frames this? The Soviet Union were all one people in his mind. And after it collapsed, all of these people who are a part of the motherland were now outside of the fringes or the boundaries of Russian territory. Time: 09:00 - 09:10 First off, fact check. Greatest catastrophe of the 20th century? Like, do you remember what else happened in the 20th century, Vladimir? Time: 09:10 - 09:20 (ominous music) Putin's worry about the collapse of this one people starts to get way worse when the West, his enemy, Time: 09:20 - 09:30 starts showing up to his neighborhood to all these ex-Soviet countries that are now independent. The West starts selling their ideology Time: 09:30 - 09:40 of democracy and capitalism and inviting them to join their military alliance called NATO. And guess what? These countries are totally buying it. Time: 09:40 - 09:50 All these ex-Soviet countries are now joining NATO. And some of them, the EU. And Putin is hating this. He's like not only did the Soviet Union divide Time: 09:50 - 10:00 and all of these people are now outside of the Russia motherland, but now they're being persuaded by the West to join their military alliance. Time: 10:00 - 10:10 This is terrible news. Over the years, this continues to happen, while Putin himself starts to chip away at Russian institutions, making them weaker and weaker. Time: 10:10 - 10:20 He's silencing his rivals and he's consolidating power in himself. (triumphant music) Time: 10:20 - 10:30 And in the past few years, he's effectively silenced anyone who can challenge him; any institution, any court, or any political rival have all been silenced. Time: 10:30 - 10:40 It's been decades since the Soviet Union fell, but as Putin gains more power, he still sees the region through the lens of the old Cold War, Soviet, Slavic empire view. Time: 10:40 - 10:50 He sees this region as one big block that has been torn apart by outside forces. Time: 10:50 - 11:00 \"The greatest catastrophe of the 20th century.\" And the worst situation of all of these, according to Putin, is Ukraine, which was like the gem of the Soviet Union. Time: 11:00 - 11:10 There was tons of cultural heritage. Again, Russia sort of started in Ukraine, not to mention it was a very populous and industrious, resource-rich place. Time: 11:10 - 11:20 And over the years Ukraine has been drifting west. It hasn't joined NATO yet, but more and more, it's been electing pro-Western presidents. Time: 11:20 - 11:30 It's been flirting with membership in NATO. It's becoming less and less attached to the Russian heritage that Putin so adores. And more than half of Ukrainians say Time: 11:30 - 11:40 that they'd be down to join the EU. 64% of them say that it would be cool joining NATO. But Putin can't handle this. He is in total denial. Time: 11:40 - 11:50 Like an ex-boyfriend who handle his ex-girlfriend starting to date someone else, Putin can't let Ukraine go. He won't let go. Time: 11:50 - 12:00 So for the past decade, he's been trying to keep the West out and bring Ukraine back into the motherland of Russia. This usually takes the form of Putin sending secret soldiers from Russia into Ukraine Time: 12:00 - 12:10 to help the people in Ukraine who want to like separate from Ukraine and join Russia. It also takes the form of, oh yeah, stealing entire parts of Ukraine for Russia. Time: 12:10 - 12:20 - Russian troops moving swiftly to take control of military bases in Crimea. - Like in 2014, Putin just did this. - To what America is officially calling Time: 12:20 - 12:30 a Russian invasion of Ukraine. - He went down and just snatched this bit of Ukraine and folded it into Russia. So you're starting to see what's going on here. Time: 12:30 - 12:40 Putin's life's work is to salvage what he calls the greatest catastrophe of the 20th century, the division and the separation of the Soviet republics from Russia. Time: 12:40 - 12:50 So let's get to present day. It's 2022. Putin is at it again. And honestly, if you really want to understand the mind of Vladimir Putin and his whole view on this, Time: 12:50 - 13:00 you have to read this. \"On the History of Unity of Russians and Ukrainians,\" by Vladimir Putin. Time: 13:00 - 13:10 A blog post that kind of sounds like a ninth grade history essay. In this essay, Vladimir Putin argues that Russia and Ukraine are one people. Time: 13:10 - 13:20 He calls them essentially the same historical and spiritual space. Kind of beautiful writing, honestly. Anyway, he argues that the division Time: 13:20 - 13:30 between the two countries is due to quote, \"a deliberate effort by those forces that have always sought to undermine our unity.\" Time: 13:30 - 13:40 And that the formula they use, these outside forces, is a classic one: divide and rule. And then he launches into this super in-depth, Time: 13:40 - 13:50 like 10-page argument, as to every single historical beat of Ukraine and Russia's history to make this argument that like, Time: 13:50 - 14:00 this is one people and the division is totally because of outside powers, i.e. the West. Okay, but listen, there's this moment at the end of the post, Time: 14:00 - 14:10 that actually kind of hit me in a big way. He says this, \"Just have a look at Austria and Germany, or the U.S. and Canada, how they live next to each other. Time: 14:10 - 14:20 Close in ethnic composition, culture, and in fact, sharing one language, they remain sovereign states with their own interests, with their own foreign policy. Time: 14:20 - 14:30 But this does not prevent them from the closest integration or allied relations. They have very conditional, transparent borders. And when crossing them citizens feel at home. Time: 14:30 - 14:40 They create families, study, work, do business. Incidentally, so do millions of those born in Ukraine Time: 14:40 - 14:50 who now live in Russia. We see them as our own close people.\" I mean, listen, like, Time: 14:50 - 15:00 I'm not in support of what Putin is doing, but like that, it's like a pretty solid like analogy. If China suddenly showed up and started like coaxing Canada into being a part of its alliance, Time: 15:00 - 15:10 I would be a little bit like, \"What's going on here?\" That's what Putin feels. And so I kind of get what he means there. Time: 15:10 - 15:20 There's a deep heritage and connection between these people. And he's seen that falter and dissolve and he doesn't like it. He clearly genuinely feels a brotherhood Time: 15:20 - 15:30 and this deep heritage connection with the people of Ukraine. Time: 15:30 - 15:40 Okay, okay, okay, okay. Putin, I get it. Your essay is compelling there at the end. You're clearly very smart and well-read. But this does not justify what you've been up to. Okay? Time: 15:40 - 15:50 It doesn't justify sending 100,000 troops to the border or sending cyber soldiers to sabotage the Ukrainian government, or annexing territory, Time: 15:50 - 16:00 fueling a conflict that has killed tens of thousands of people in Eastern Ukraine. No. Okay. No matter how much affection you feel for Ukrainian heritage and its connection to Russia, this is not okay. Time: 16:00 - 16:10 Again, it's like the boyfriend who genuinely loves his girlfriend. They had a great relationship, but they broke up and she's free to see whomever she wants. Time: 16:10 - 16:20 But Putin is not ready to let go. - [Man In Blue Shirt] What the hell's wrong with you? I love you, Jessica. What the hell is wrong with you? Dude, don't fucking touch me. I love you. - Worldstar! Time: 16:20 - 16:30 - What is wrong with you? - Just stop! - Putin has constructed his own reality here. One in which Ukraine is actually being controlled Time: 16:30 - 16:40 by shadowy Western forces who are holding the people of Ukraine hostage. And if that he invades, it will be a swift victory because Ukrainians will accept him with open arms. Time: 16:40 - 16:50 The great liberator. (triumphant music) Like, this guy's a total romantic. Time: 16:50 - 17:00 He's a history buff and a romantic. And he has a hill to die on here. And it is liberating the people who have been taken from the Russian motherland. Kind of like the abusive boyfriend, who's like, Time: 17:00 - 17:10 \"She actually really loves me, but it's her annoying friends who were planting all these ideas in her head. That's why she broke up with me.\" And it's like, \"No, dude, she's over you.\" Time: 17:10 - 17:20 - [Man In Blue Shirt] What the hell is wrong with you? I love you, Jessica. - I mean, maybe this video should be called Putin is just like your abusive ex-boyfriend. - [Man In Blue Shirt] What the hell is wrong with you? I love you, Jessica! - Worldstar! - What's wrong with you? Time: 17:20 - 17:30 - Okay. So where does this leave us? It's 2022, Putin is showing up to these meetings in Europe to tell them where he stands. Time: 17:30 - 17:40 He says, \"NATO, you cannot expand anymore. No new members. And you need to withdraw all your troops from Eastern Europe, my neighborhood.\" He knows these demands will never be accepted Time: 17:40 - 17:50 because they're ludicrous. But what he's doing is showing a false effort to say, \"Well, we tried to negotiate with the West, but they didn't want to.\" Time: 17:50 - 18:00 Hence giving a little bit more justification to a Russian invasion. So will Russia invade? Is there war coming? Maybe; it's impossible to know because it's all inside of the head of this guy. Time: 18:00 - 18:10 But, if I were to make the best argument that war is not coming tomorrow, I would look at a few things. Number one, war in Ukraine would be incredibly costly Time: 18:10 - 18:20 for Vladimir Putin. Russia has a far superior army to Ukraine's, but still, Ukraine has a very good army that is supported by the West and would give Putin a pretty bad bloody nose Time: 18:20 - 18:30 in any invasion. Controlling territory in Ukraine would be very hard. Ukraine is a giant country. They would fight back and it would be very hard to actually conquer and take over territory. Time: 18:30 - 18:40 Another major point here is that if Russia invades Ukraine, this gives NATO new purpose. If you remember, NATO was created because of the Cold War, Time: 18:40 - 18:50 because the Soviet Union was big and nuclear powered. Once the Soviet Union fell, NATO sort of has been looking for a new purpose over the past couple of decades. Time: 18:50 - 19:00 If Russia invades Ukraine, NATO suddenly has a brand new purpose to unite and to invest in becoming more powerful than ever. Putin knows that. And it would be very bad news for him if that happened. Time: 19:00 - 19:10 But most importantly, perhaps the easiest clue for me to believe that war isn't coming tomorrow is the Russian propaganda machine Time: 19:10 - 19:20 is not preparing the Russian people for an invasion. In 2014, when Russia was about to invade and take over Crimea, this part of Ukraine, there was a barrage of state propaganda Time: 19:20 - 19:30 that prepared the Russian people that this was a justified attack. So when it happened, it wasn't a surprise and it felt very normal. That isn't happening right now in Russia. Time: 19:30 - 19:40 At least for now. It may start happening tomorrow. But for now, I think Putin is showing up to the border, flexing his muscles and showing the West that he is earnest. Time: 19:40 - 19:50 I'm not sure that he's going to invade tomorrow, but he very well could. I mean, read the guy's blog post and you'll realize that he is a romantic about this. Time: 19:50 - 20:00 He is incredibly idealistic about the glory days of the Slavic empires, and he wants to get it back. Time: 20:00 - 20:10 So there is dangerous momentum towards war. And the way war works is even a small little, like, fight, can turn into the other guy Time: 20:10 - 20:20 doing something bigger and crazier. And then the other person has to respond with something a little bit bigger. That's called escalation. And there's not really a ceiling to how much that momentum can spin out of control. Time: 20:20 - 20:30 That is why it's so scary when two nuclear countries go to war with each other, because there's kind of no ceiling. So yeah, it's dangerous. This is scary. Time: 20:30 - 20:40 I'm not sure what happens next here, but the best we can do is keep an eye on this. At least for now, we better understand what Putin really wants out of all of this. Time: 20:40 - 20:50 Thanks for watching. (dramatic music) Time: 20:50 - 21:00 I appreciate everyone for being here. I'm excited for another year of a lot of bigger, more ambitious videos on this channel. I've been diving really deep. Time: 21:00 - 21:10 I've been printing a lot of things out and reading them in hard copy, which I really like and highlighting them for these videos, which is really helpful for me and hopefully helpful for you. If you want to support this work, Time: 21:10 - 21:20 I have a Patreon which you can go check out. There's a link in my description. And then I also am selling presets and LUTs for video and photo. It's what I use to color, this screen right now Time: 21:20 - 21:30 is being colored by a LUT, which is a color profile that you can put on your video to make it look pretty. This is what it looks like without the LUT. Hi. Time: 21:30 - 21:40 And this is what it looks like with the LUT. It's a lot better. And I have quite a few of them that we've been working on for probably over a year and a half with a professional colorist. It's now out and for sale. Time: 21:40 - 21:50 I also have them for photos as well. Thank you all for being here and I'll see you in the next video. Time: 21:50 - 22:00All of Eastern Europe depends on Russian energy. Putin knows (from historical western behavior) that energy and monetary economics rely on military hegemony. Although separate organizations, this is as much about asserting clout in the European Union economic sphere as it is about containing NATO.",

00:40 place 30,000 square m of space which is 300,000 ft for those Imperial people out Time: 00:40 - 00:50 there like me and I'm hanging out with Eric Who currently owns the bunker this is where the crew uh was taking the showers showering 8 5 me of rock Calia Time: 00:50 - 01:00 yeah it's got to be one of the deepest showers in the world he's been showing me giant cannons and the sleeping quarters and the hospital and the giant Time: 01:00 - 01:10 generators that have provided electricity for this place from the outside this thing does not look big at all Time: 01:10 - 01:20 wow look at that that is amazing a reminder that every time you see a little door in the Forest that goes into Time: 01:20 - 01:30 a bunker it's probably a massive network of tunnels 2 m of concrete here at the entrance you go inside of this door and you were L into a Labyrinth of tunnels Time: 01:30 - 01:40 and weaponry 8 km of walkways 8 km oh and with the most gnarly doors you've ever seen in your life they're Time: 01:40 - 01:50 quadruple fortified with huge slabs of concrete this is like 2 m of concrete it sit behind there with a Time: 01:50 - 02:00 rifle and be able to protect the entrances wow no one is getting into this bunker anytime [Music] Time: 02:00 - 02:10 soon I went to Switzerland to hunt for bunkers fortresses drilled impossibly deep into mountains and cliffs and Villages hidden from view but packing Time: 02:10 - 02:20 deadly power wow I've seen so many bunkers you don't have to look super hard to find them they're everywhere but there's a bunker right here look at this Time: 02:20 - 02:30 this is not a rock this is a door these little doors in the middle of the forest so unassuming so benign but Time: 02:30 - 02:40 boy if you knew what was inside let's be clear this isn't normal most countries don't bore into mountains as their defense strategy but Switzerland isn't like other countries when you live in Time: 02:40 - 02:50 Switzerland you never really have a sense of threat we're Switzerland we're we're neutral right and nothing going to happen to us so instead of of forming Time: 02:50 - 03:00 alliances and sending troops they dug and the results are nearly 10,000 of these scattered all throughout the country and that is what I've been searching Time: 03:00 - 03:10 for okay okay okay where are you my bunkers where are you my bunkers ah I see something down there that is not natural erosion on this Cliff I keep Time: 03:10 - 03:20 looking for more and more and I'm realizing there are too many for me to fly to like there are dozens up there this Cliff is just riddled with little Windows totally primed in prep to just Time: 03:20 - 03:30 light up this entire Valley if there was an invading Army from the north oh and it's not just the mountains I also discovered hundreds of thousands of bunkers dug under Swiss homes a further Time: 03:30 - 03:40 expression of the Swiss habit of digging to remain neutral the bunkers are at the center of a discussion that is heating up as the world becomes dangerous again Time: 03:40 - 03:50 so Switzerland is once again debating what these bunkers mean to them and what it means to be safe secure and neutral in a changing world Time: 03:50 - 04:00 [Music] Time: 04:00 - 04:10 okay wait before we continue this story I need to tell you about today's sponsor as we look at the beautiful Swiss Countryside today's sponsor is nordvpn Time: 04:10 -

05:40 here and make this in-depth piece on bunkers it's like a dream come true okay I'm going to get back to the Time: 05:40 - 05:50 road I'm on top of a mountain overlooking a stunning view but I'm looking for a bunker up here it's on the wall of this cliff I think I need to fly Time: 05:50 - 06:00 the Drone to find it but it's raining that's a problem the fog's rolling and I got to be Time: 06:00 - 06:10 quick okay up on the side of this Cliff ah I know there's a bunker nearby oh Time: 06:10 - 06:20 God [Music] Jesus come on okay that was too close Time: 06:20 - 06:30 all right I think this is my takeoff Time: 06:30 - 06:40 point oh yeah I see bunkers I see bunkers oh boy just blending into the side of this mountain oh my God look at Time: 06:40 - 06:50 [Music] this I mean just looking at these bunkers you start to realize how incred ibly ambitious of a feat this is to Time: 06:50 - 07:00 drill into the side of a cliff and decide to build an entire network of tunnels that are connected and well Time: 07:00 - 07:10 armed and strategically placed so you can hit the targets you want to hit oh look there's another one oh my God look at this that is just at the base of this Cliff oh my goodness and it and it's Time: 07:10 - 07:20 hidden the only reason I can see it is because I am above it but if you're looking at it straight on you don't see it it Blends in perfectly look at that Time: 07:20 - 07:30 there's one behind all of these little facades they're just guns that are hiding in the wall of this Time: 07:30 - 07:40 [Music] [Music] Time: 07:40 - 07:50 Cliff okay on to the next bunker [Applause] [Music] Time: 07:50 - 08:00 by the 1800s the Swiss were really good at digging into mountains building cable cars trains they just they got really Time: 08:00 - 08:10 good and that prowess for digging became incredibly useful in the 1940s when their situation looked like this surrounded by fascist regimes that are Time: 08:10 - 08:20 quickly taking over Europe very effectively these two allies Italy and Germany with Switzerland kind of sandwiched right in the middle neutral Switzerland wanted to stay out of the war so they did whatever it took but one Time: 08:20 - 08:30 of the major things they did when they wanted to stay neutral was they started [Music] digging they turned their mountains into Time: 08:30 - 08:40 a literal giant Fortress Yes you heard me right they turned their mountains into a fortress or I guess technically if you're a military nerd a redout Time: 08:40 - 08:50 redout just means a basically an impenetrable Fortress that is dug into the ground but readouts usually look like this one Fortress Switzerland wanted to turn their entire enre Alpine Time: 08:50 - 09:00 region which is like a huge part of their country into a giant readout I'm going to explain to you the strategy in just a second like what the thinking was here because it's a little paradoxical and weird and war is weird but yeah the Time: 09:00 - 09:10 point is here that they started digging and digging and started creating what one historian has called the biggest Fortress in Europe Time: 09:10 - 09:20 [Music] Time: 09:20 - 09:30 I'm at the base of the Swiss Alps right now and I'm in a village that is very Switzerland it's got a lot of grass and cows and barns but a few of these barns Time: 09:30 - 09:40 like this one behind me have a little secret inside that look light when I open it Time: 09:40 - 09:50 wow this gun is massive has a range of 21 km and this is just one of four B bunkers that are all connected to each Time: 09:50 - 10:00 other in this Village they're going down here so so now we're in the Time: 10:00 - 10:10 tunnels oh my gosh wow so we're just walking under the Green Grass and the cows right Time: 10:10 - 10:20 [Music] now oh my goodness the grenades this 10.5 wow CM Time: 10:20 - 10:30 grenades W you have to use this uh shell for uh the explosion scks here and the Time: 10:30 - 10:40 whole thing looks like that oh it's like a giant bullet yeah first the grenade in and then the the Shelf Time: 10:40 - 10:50 in shows to the people that they have to be quiet if they to to to to uh to Time: 10:50 - 11:00 protect all our army Secrets normal people and the soldiers say h Qui all all top Time: 11:00 - 11:10 secret Switzerland turning their country Time: 11:10 - 11:20 into a giant Fortress was basically made possible because of these giant natural walls that they already have if you're an invading Army you can't get a bunch Time: 11:20 - 11:30 of men over these mountains but these walls had gates in them those gates are called mountain passes and when you're not in Wartime mountain passes are Time: 11:30 - 11:40 actually really good do you see that bridge behind me that bridge has been used for a long time to let people flow throughout this pass but if you're Time: 11:40 - 11:50 Switzerland in 1942 these gateways through the Alps that have been used for trade are now a liability they're now a Gateway for invading armies to come take over your country Time: 11:50 - 12:00 so this is where they focus their attention all these choke points all of these gateways to their mountains the Time: 12:00 - 12:10 idea was if the Italians start coming from that way or the Germans start coming from that way they can sit in their bunkers and blow the Smither out of anyone coming up this P because again Time: 12:10 - 12:20 it's a choke point no one can go anywhere else you can't go over the mountains you have to go through this pass Time: 12:20 - 12:30 all right I'm down from the mountains for a little bit and it's because I got invited to hang out with this guy he's a retired Swiss historian who's freaking Time: 12:30 - 12:40 obsessed with maps of Switzerland I've never felt so seen in my life I'm a artillery Gunner I did my basic training Time: 12:40 - 12:50 in a fortress and then we went here just for training syc in the prealps he's showing me with this amazing 3D relief Time: 12:50 - 13:00 map what this Fortress actually looked like here in these high mountains were several very very important Time: 13:00 - 13:10 fortresses some here there were old ones and some Modern new ones here here and even even here here is there are bankers Time: 13:10 - 13:20 and there is toon do you understand yes I saw the Toblerone on the toone there is a last toone and also here is one Time: 13:20 - 13:30 when France was defeated in the summer 1940 and Switzerland was surrounded by the axis this was a let's say an Time: 13:30 - 13:40 emergency solution H this was the [Music] [Laughter] redou okay so I hike up to this Swiss Time: 13:40 - 13:50 House in the middle of the pass looks like just a normal Swiss house is beautiful but you look closely and you see something these windows aren't real Time: 13:50 - 14:00 windows they're painted on this thing is actually solid concrete this is not a chalet these are not like barn doors oh Time: 14:00 - 14:10 wait are they going to let me do this oh my God oh my God look at this those are just little gun holes put your gun Time: 14:10 - 14:20 through that thing and you can shoot wow look at that this house is not just a house with some gun holes in it it's actually a Time: 14:20 - 14:30 network of tunnels hey check this out I found a fake rock with a gun in it I was looking at this rock and it looked a little weird like a little off up close it Time: 14:30 - 14:40 looks like a like a real Rock it's not look under yep oh yeah boom I see your secrets I've Time: 14:40 - 14:50 looked at enough bunkers to know what the Playbook is hide something either in a village or in a mountain M put a huge Time: 14:50 - 15:00 network of tunnels under it and just point at the pass and get ready to fire in case there's an Time: 15:00 - 15:10 invasion but wait a minute let's examine the logic here yeah it's really cool to have mountains full of really protective bunkers really cool but most people in Time: 15:10 - 15:20 Switzerland do not live in the mountains most people live up here on this flat plateau and in the early 1940s they were sitting ducks the point here was was not to protect the people directly but Time: 15:20 - 15:30 rather to signal to Hitler and musolini that if they wanted to connect their two empires they would have to go through the Alps and that that would be incredibly costly and basically Time: 15:30 - 15:40 impossible it's like using defense as the deterrent oh and it worked the Nazis had a plan all fleshed out to invade Switzerland but they never did it and Time: 15:40 - 15:50 yes that is not just because of these bunkers it is because Switzerland was letting the Nazis store money and stolen stuff in their Banks trading with them Etc the bunkers were a part of the Time: 15:50 - 16:00 deterrent strategy but the Swifts really pandered to the Nazis as another form of staying neutral something they hear a lot about even you know 70 years later I'm at a dam and if my Intel is Time: 16:00 - 16:10 right that big giant mountain behind me is actually a Time: 16:10 - 16:20 bunker [Music] and I don't see anything wait a minute yes I do what is that what Time: 16:20 - 16:30 is that I see you big boy you are a very Time: 16:30 - 16:40 well-hidden gun wow that thing Blends in very nicely with that as their Fortress like they can't no one can fire Time: 16:40 - 16:50 back another hidden bunker another successful drone flight nice job drone let's get out of here on to the next Time: 16:50 - 17:00 one I hear there's a tunnel up up there at the top of that mountain that foggy foggy Wet Time: 17:00 - 17:10 Mountain 3 and 1 12 km I can do this let's Time: 17:10 - 17:20 go by the way big thanks to the subscriber who recommended this bunker to me I put a call out to ask Swiss people what bunkers I Time: 17:20 -

21:30 let's make everyone have a bunker in their house so that we can be protected against nuclear apocalypse okay cool Time: 21:30 - 21:40 idea in theory in practice incredibly impractical and very expensive so they did what they do for just about everything in Switzerland they put it to Time: 21:40 - 21:50 a vote and so in the' 60s they decreed bunkers as a right they actually lined out EX exactly how to build bunkers they Time: 21:50 - 22:00 required everyone to build them either retroactively or in their new buildings and the Swiss government would pay like 70% of the cost for these bunkers the Time: 22:00 - 22:10 people would be protected using the same strategy that they've always used digging holes so I went to the factory of a Time: 22:10 - 22:20 company that makes bunkers the beds and the dry toilets and the air ventilation feel like I'm wandering through the Ikea for bomb Time: 22:20 -

24:40 bunker that is for anyone on this neighborhood block to come to in case of an emergency it's fully decked out as expected and it even has a full-blown Time: 24:40 - 24:50 operating room and a room for dead bodies like that's what that is back Time: 24:50 - 25:00 there Putin's invasion of Ukraine changed everything for a lot of places in the world but here in Switzerland it didn't only change how people think Time: 25:00 - 25:10 about bunkers and physical safety but it also kicked off a debate about the complex topic of Swiss neutrality the Swiss government says it is adopting the Time: 25:10 - 25:20 EU sanctions package on Russia that's a huge move this is Switzerland who may I remind you did not take aside when it came to Time: 25:20 - 25:30 Hitler Swiss president ignasio CI said extraordinary times called for Extraordinary Measures joining in on sanctions for a lot of people is a Time: 25:40 - 25:50 massive violation of the thing that has kept them neutral and peaceful for like 200 years this Time: 25:50 - 26:00 several parties saying well you know we should be more flexible more traditional parties saying well you know neutrality Time: 26:00 - 26:10 means not doing anything not joining any party not helping anything but rather you know offer I don't don't know how you Time: 26:10 - 26:20 say now we took over the sanctions from the EU which basically makes us a war party I don't like it I don't think it's right if from a country that isn't obsessively neutral you're kind of like Time: 26:20 - 26:30 dude you got to take a stance but here they think differently about the right side and the cost of choosing a side in conflict or more importantly the benefit Time: 26:30 - 26:40 of not choosing a side I think the Swiss are the people themselves want neutrality but we never know I mean you know the majority rules you know it's Time: 26:40 - 26:50 [Music] democracy okay okay well that that's it Time: 26:50 - 27:00 that is my journey I have to say this story left a bit of an impression on me I came here thinking I was going to go hiking around and stumble upon some abandoned bunkers in the forest but as I Time: 27:00 - 27:10 dug into this I found myself understanding Switzerland in a new way this place where the people didn't colonize other countries but stayed here digging in their mountains so Time: 27:10 - 27:20 obsessively to defend their ideas about neutrality a neutrality that is finding new meaning in a changing Time: 27:20 -

      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:10 so there's some super strange stuff happening online right now and i need to tell you about it first look at this tweet the first tweet ever tweeted in the history of twitter the tweet was by Time: 00:10 - 00:20 jack dorsey i'm one of the co-founders of twitter and this tweet was somehow just purchased for two million nine hundred and fifteen thousand Time: 00:20 - 00:30 835 dollars and 47 cents [Laughter] you serious and it's not just a tweet Time: 00:30 - 00:40 just last month a single jpeg sold 469 million dollars oh my god the nba is selling little moments of basketball games for hundreds of thousands of Time: 00:40 - 00:50 dollars this is all sorts of digital things that people are purchasing a version of them for lots of money there are three simple letters that you Time: 00:50 - 01:00 need to understand to understand what's going on here those letters are nft until the latest trend is sweeping the internet what exactly is an nft so Time: 01:00 - 01:10 called nft y'all in the chat understand what an nft is like does that stand for not safe for work what is this what does this mean why would you pay for an nft Time: 01:10 - 01:20 when you can look at it for free is this a gigantic bubble just waiting to burst i believe in this space with my whole heart i'm just fascinated by it all of it this story is much bigger than a six Time: 01:20 - 01:30 hundred thousand dollar cat gif or a three million dollar tweet it's a story about human psychology and how the way we value things is shifting Time: 01:30 - 01:40 because of technology a technology that some people think may revolutionize our society while at the same time accelerating the climate Time: 01:40 - 01:50 disaster it's really nuts it's all of these things together and i want to explain it to you so let's do this Time: 01:50 - 02:00 [Music] officially insane lebron james Time: 02:00 - 02:10 nft stands for non-fungible token okay there it is that's the explanation non-fungible token makes sense right so the video's over now Time: 02:10 - 02:20 no one of my issues with this topic is that people throw around things like blockchain crypto art ledger nft and they just expect me to Time: 02:20 - 02:30 understand what they're talking about and i didn't okay i'm going to talk about a tesla for a second customized by unplugged performance to be the most unique and Time: 02:30 - 02:40 high quality tesla there is oh and it's not just a tesla it's also 20 000 you can enter for a chance to win the tesla and 20 000 by going to omaze.com Time: 02:40 - 02:50 johnny harris when you donate 10 or more your donation goes to support Time: 02:50 - 03:00 two non-profits 501c3 is the first one they are an organization that seeks to mobilize the next generation to fight climate change by creating a global community that embraces low carbon Time: 03:00 - 03:10 culture the other one is called give power which seeks to give clean drinkable water to the 2.2 billion people around the world Time: 03:10 - 03:20 who do not have safe access to clean water the nonprofit uses its deep solar expertise to power and provide clean water food security and light to regions around the Time: 03:20 - 03:30 world so to potentially win a tesla and twenty thousand dollars and to support these organizations go to omaze.com johnny harris to find out more so Time: 03:30 - 03:40 fungible let's talk about the word fungible it's this very specific word that economists use it has a very precise definition i want to use a different word for Time: 03:40 - 03:50 fungible for a second let's just use the word replaceable non-fungible means non-replaceable you can't replace it there's only one of them it's unique non-fungible let me give you an example Time: 03:50 - 04:00 of something i feel very strongly about let's say you want to buy an orange jacket Time: 04:00 - 04:10 this is really absurd i've actually never counted these before um stop it Time: 04:10 - 04:20 get some help you want to buy an orange jacket from uniqlo you go on the internet and a jacket costs 39 if you purchase one of these jackets for 39 you don't care what specific jacket they Time: 04:20 - 04:30 send to you they're going to make thousands of jackets in your size send them to stores send them to people and they will send one to you you don't care Time: 04:30 - 04:40 which one it is the jacket is fungible it's replaceable as long as you get one that's identical to the rest it's worth the same to you they're interchangeable however let's talk about one uniqlo Time: 04:40 - 04:50 orange jacket that has been with me for a very long time [Music] this is the original and for those who Time: 04:50 - 05:00 don't know i sort of have a strange attachment to this jacket i just love it i love the color i like feel like an identity with this thing and it's sort of starting to disintegrate but i love Time: 05:00 - 05:10 it and i kind of fell in love this jacket is not replaceable if i went onto the website and paid 39 for a uniqlo orange jacket that was this exact same model Time: 05:10 - 05:20 it would not be this jacket this jacket is non-fungible it is the only one on the planet that exists it has emotional value it has significance it is a Time: 05:20 - 05:30 very valuable thing because it is scarce there's only one of them it's valuable to me at least and i kind of fell in love okay we can put these down for a Time: 05:30 - 05:40 second everything in our economy is one or the other fungible or non-fungible a sack of rice is fungible you just want a sack of rice you don't care which one it is the Time: 05:40 - 05:50 mona lisa non-fungible there's only one unsurprisingly non-fungible things are way more valuable than fungible things so that's the nf in nft non-fungible Time: 05:50 - 06:00 now let's talk about the t which is token this is a very internety word and to explain this i have to explain something i have avoided explaining for Time: 06:00 - 06:10 a very long time the blockchain luckily there's a way to understand this and i'm going to make it as painless as Time: 06:10 - 06:20 possible let's say i want to buy three slices of pizza from my friend anna she charges me six dollars for these three slices i don't use cash anymore so i pull out my Time: 06:20 - 06:30 debit card my bank card and i swipe on her little terminal as soon as i swipe this card a message is sent to my bank and it says hey johnny who has an account at your bank Time: 06:30 - 06:40 wants to spend six dollars on pizza and that money needs to go to anna's bank this is like the bread and butter of what a bank does all day they document Time: 06:40 - 06:50 every transaction that comes in from all their customers they send out money to the other banks and at the end of the day they have a tally of all the money that went out of your Time: 06:50 - 07:00 account and into your account and they can give you a number they can say based on all of these transactions you have fifty dollars in your bank account and so when that request comes in as i swipe my card my bank is like okay so based on Time: 07:00 - 07:10 all of your transactions you have 50 in your account i can send six dollars to anna's bank approved and they approve the transaction once that money comes Time: 07:10 - 07:20 into anna's bank anna's bank is doing the same thing they're like oh cool she had 80 and now she has 86 and they add it to her record more and more your money is just a Time: 07:20 - 07:30 number on a screen it's the result of a bunch of transactions you don't barter with physical things and you don't use cash as much Time: 07:30 - 07:40 so the bank keeping meticulous records of every transaction becomes really important we trust the bank to do this correctly so thank you banks banks and other Time: 07:40 - 07:50 middlemen have been keeping stuff like this running smoothly for centuries i mean kind of absolutely the nasdaq everything and more has been the worst day on wall Time: 07:50 - 08:00 street what in the world is happening on wall street there have been a few bumps in the road with the rise of the internet people started to wonder is there a way that we could do this same thing coordinate this transaction of Time: 08:00 - 08:10 transfer of money between two people without the bank the result is a very clever concept called the blockchain Time: 08:10 - 08:20 the blockchain fulfills the same thing the bank was doing but instead of doing this privately on my bank account and talking to anna's bank all of the transactions are actually recorded Time: 08:20 - 08:30 publicly on the internet [Music] so let's redo this example in a crypto world anna charges me six crypto coins for my Time: 08:30 - 08:40 three slices of pizza i go to swipe my proverbial bank card to say yes i want to pay you six points instead of the bank seeing that request for a Time: 08:40 - 08:50 transaction and trying to validate it it goes on to this public record where a bunch of people's computers all around the world are keeping track of every single Time: 08:50 - 09:00 transaction of everyone always if i don't indeed have the six coins in my account to pay anna all of the people's computers who are Time: 09:00 - 09:10 keeping track of every single transaction will notice that there's a discrepancy they'll be like whoa whoa dude you don't have six coins we're looking at every transaction ever and Time: 09:10 - 09:20 you don't have six coins your transaction is rejected if i do have six coins all of the computers looking at the public record will see that request Time: 09:20 - 09:30 for a transaction and they'll be like yep approved you have six coins and now anna has six coins and they'll write that transaction into the public record now anna having those six extra coins is Time: 09:30 - 09:40 now the business of everybody everybody now knows that the point here is that the group verifies the legitimacy of every transaction by keeping an eye on every Time: 09:40 - 09:50 transaction to make sure that it adds up okay i'm getting hot at this point so i'm taking off my orange jacket okay so you're wondering what does the blockchain and this public record have Time: 09:50 - 10:00 anything to do with cat gifts that sell for six hundred thousand dollars well i'm about to tell you so in my Time: 10:00 - 10:10 pizza example we talked about blockchain as a way to verify currency transaction i pay you this much you pay me this much and everybody knows how much everybody has because it's all Time: 10:10 - 10:20 public but this is where it starts to bend my mind a little bit what if we apply this to something that isn't money or currency let's say one day you're just looking at the ledger and the ledger's like johnny Time: 10:20 - 10:30 wants to give anna six coins okay he's got six coins approved and then a transaction comes up that's like a malaysian businessman wants to give three million dollars worth of coins to Time: 10:30 - 10:40 jack dorsey in exchange for a little token or digital certificate that says that the tweet is now somehow Time: 10:40 - 10:50 owned by the malaysian businessman the only thing that the blockchain cares about is does the malaysian businessman have three million dollars worth of coins Time: 10:50 - 11:00 and so a bunch of computers all around the world look at the whole entire list of transactions and say like yeah this guy has more than three million dollars worth of coins approved they approve the Time: 11:00 - 11:10 transaction and now it is written in a public record that is unalterable that says that this malaysian businessman owns this tweet the token has been Time: 11:10 - 11:20 transferred to somebody new non-fungible token nft and if there's anything that gets human psychology to value something Time: 11:20 - 11:30 it's if an entire group validates that it's real and that there's only one of them there are tens of thousands of nfts of all kinds Time: 11:30 - 11:40 some music is being given tokens lots of art is being minted as tokens and being bought and sold and then of course there's uh nba top shot who's Time: 11:40 - 11:50 taking advantage of this these highlight moments these top shot moments from your favorite nba players have been turned into non-fungible tokens jesse made Time: 11:50 - 12:00 headlines the other day when he paid 208 000 dollars for lebron james top shot it's the weirdest thing as soon as humans have enough abundance Time: 12:00 - 12:10 and have their basic needs met food shelter warmth etc the next frontier is to create value in things that have no inherent value Time: 12:10 - 12:20 the value turns into psychological hype excitement around a certain thing we've been doing that forever i mean that's the whole art industry is based Time: 12:20 - 12:30 on the idea of a bunch of people deciding that this painting this little bit of canvas and wood and paint is valuable and thus it is valuable Time: 12:30 - 12:40 the only difference about now is we now have the technology to do this in a non-physical way using this very sophisticated internet Time: 12:40 - 12:50 technology that is maturing very quickly okay so this is a lot of hype and i know you're probably thinking like cool there's a bunch of rich people online buying and trading digital art and Time: 12:50 - 13:00 there's millions of dollars worth of cards i thought you said that this was going to have the potential to change the world and i'm getting there but first i need to talk about the crazy Time: 13:00 - 13:10 flip side to the nft fad the reality is that the technology that is the backbone for all of this the blockchain stuff that we've been talking about relies on Time: 13:10 - 13:20 the public ledger thing that i talked about like that is the sort of heart and soul conceptually but mechanically like physically what it relies on is computers doing a bunch of little Time: 13:20 - 13:30 calculations all day and night forever these computers aren't real computers they don't have any memory or screens or anything they all they do Time: 13:30 - 13:40 is just make little micro calculations all day all night most nfts are stored on a blockchain called ethereum Time: 13:40 - 13:50 and as of now in early april 2021 when i'm filming this the ethereum blockchain is using 33 terawatt hours of electricity and Time: 13:50 - 14:00 you're like what's a terawatt hour of electricity that's the same amount of power as the country of serbia a reminder that generating electricity usually comes from power plants that are Time: 14:00 - 14:10 burning fossil fuels that are putting carbon into the atmosphere which is a big freaking problem a man-made disaster on a global scale Time: 14:10 - 14:20 the power consumption of the ethereum blockchain is exploding it is just it quadrupled in like eight months and it is showing no sign of slowing down it is a lot of energy and to think that Time: 14:20 - 14:30 that much energy is not being used to like move people around or produce things it's used to like crunch numbers in a weird computer warehouse somewhere so Time: 14:30 - 14:40 that somebody can buy a fake token of a thing that we only oh man i just i can't it's just it's mind- blowing it's such an ironic Time: 14:40 - 14:50 moment where it's like this is all digital it's all fake it's not real but it's having deeply real world effects ouch Time: 14:50 - 15:00 i just want to finish this video now talking about what this might mean for our world going forward this is definitely hype and that's the whole point i mean Time: 15:00 - 15:10 these speculation markets are all about hype we see this all the time with new technologies and new things that people get excited about and they swarm it with their investments and the price goes up Time: 15:10 - 15:20 and then something happens for example come on uncle phil this is the 90s man what's a web page something ducks walk Time: 15:20 - 15:30 on equal value so cash in on today's new account and it's the 90s it's hammer time in the 90s the internet was taking Time: 15:30 - 15:40 off and people were just realizing that you could like make money on the internet you could like make big businesses on the internet the stock market was surging 400 in five years Time: 15:40 - 15:50 mainly fueled by so much hype and excitement around these new internet companies make the record as america's longest boom the new economy is it a boom without end this Time: 15:50 - 16:00 rise peaked in march of 2000 and then the bubble burst and a lot of these companies either went under or completely lost all of this Time: 16:00 - 16:10 excitement valuation that they had sort of it was down some but did that mean that the internet went away did that mean that internet businesses didn't come back no companies went on to reshape our Time: 16:10 - 16:20 world right now i think we are probably in that stage of nfts it's hype it's novel it's exciting but what it's doing Time: 16:20 - 16:30 is it's pushing our minds to think differently about how we validate and verify things if i buy a house there is a whole thick stack of paperwork and a Time: 16:30 - 16:40 bunch of middlemen to make sure that it is very clear who owns the house and how that money gets transferred from one person to another it is like a nightmare of an experience if suddenly technology Time: 16:40 - 16:50 existed that took away the centralized middleman and made transactions between people able to be authenticated verifiable and much smoother Time: 16:50 - 17:00 that could change our world i'm not here to say if the bubble's gonna burst or whatever i don't know i just know that this is a crazy moment where we're getting our heads around a new technology and what it means and Time: 17:00 - 17:10 eventually we'll adapt this won't be crazy this won't be novel anymore prices will go down but the technology that allowed it all to happen will probably stick around Time: 17:10 - 17:20 [Music] Time: 17:20 - 17:30 you Time: 17:40 - 17:50No matter how well this was explained, I still feel I’m missing something fundamentally important as to why people are spending money on this shite",

      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:10 of San Diego, California. The USS Nimitz, one of the US Navy's largest aircraft carriers is preparing for deployment to the Persian Gulf. But the radar technicians aboard notice something weird. Time: 00:10 - 00:20 The military report from that day says that they notice quote, \"multiple objects descending from around 60,000 feet down to 50 feet in a matter of seconds.\" Time: 00:20 - 00:30 Very high velocity. 60,000 feet. A reminder that commercial airplanes fly at like 36,000 feet. Time: 00:30 - 00:40 The report goes on to say that these objects quote, \"hover for a short time and depart at super high velocities\" with, quote, \"advanced acceleration capabilities.\" Time: 00:40 - 00:50 At first, these radar techs thought that their fancy new radar system was messed up, so they recalibrated the radar, but the signal remained. Time: 00:50 - 01:00 Something was up here. - They're telling us they have a contact on their radar. They don't know what it is. They just have a blip. Well, they've been watching these things, and what he told me is they had been looking at these things Time: 01:00 - 01:10 as we're driving. I says, sir, we've been tracking these things for about two weeks. That's, we had been at sea for two weeks. He goes, this is the first time we've had planes airborne. We want you to go see what these are. - [Johnny] So they sent out two F/A-18s to investigate. Time: 01:10 - 01:20 The report from that day describes a day of blue skies, no clouds and unlimited visibility. These two Navy pilots arrive to the scene, Time: 01:20 - 01:30 each with a weapons officer in the back. They look around and notice something strange in the water below. - So, as we're looking down off the right side, Time: 01:30 - 01:40 the back seater in the airplane, Jim, he says, \"Hey, skipper, do you,\" and that's about what he gets out of his mouth and I go, \"What the hell is that?\" - [Johnny] It looks as if some cross shaped object Time: 01:40 - 01:50 the size of a massive airplane is submerged right underneath the surface of the water, and above it, it appears to be boiling. And just above the boiling water, an object is hovering. Time: 01:50 - 02:00 - And we saw this little white Tic Tac looking object, and it's just kind of moving above the whitewater area. - Like no predictable movement, no predictable trajectory. Time: 02:00 - 02:10 - Yeah. - I guess it was just- - It was just like a ping pong ball. - No acceleration. - Very, very random. - Acceleration. - [Johnny] The Navy report describes this object as quote, Time: 02:10 - 02:20 \"an elongated egg or a Tic Tac that was uniformly white across the entire body.\" It was approximately 46 feet in length. Time: 02:20 - 02:30 One of the pilots with his weapons officer in the back wanted to get a closer look. - So then I go, hey, I'm gonna go check it out. - [Johnny] So, he turns this jet down towards the object. The other pilot's staying back to get a wider view. Time: 02:30 - 02:40 - So, I'm coming down, and as I get to 12 o'clock, as the Tic Tac's doing this, it literally, it's like it be, it's aware of us and it just goes bloop, and it kind of points out towards the west Time: 02:40 - 02:50 and starts coming up. So, now it's obviously knows that we're there, whatever this thing is, it knows that we're there. So, I'm kind of almost coming out co altitude as this thing's coming up. I'm gonna meet it, and it just, as it crosses our nose, it just, Time: 02:50 - 03:00 it accelerates and literally, in less than, you know, probably less than a half second, it just goes, and it's gone. - And you saw no visible propulsion? Time: 03:00 - 03:10 - Right. - [Interviewer] No wings or anything- - No. - [Interviewer] To no make it fly in our atmosphere. - [Johnny] As these two pilots are heading back to their aircraft carrier, they get a radio call from one of their radar techs. Time: 03:10 - 03:20 - I mean, he's like, hey, sir, you're not gonna believe this, but that thing is at your cap. It showed back up. It just popped up. The other, this is like 60 miles away. It just reappears. - [Johnny] Within seconds, 60 miles away, just like that. Time: 03:20 - 03:30 By the time they get back to the Nimitz, the object is gone. So, they gear up and get ready to send another jet out to investigate, and this time, Time: 03:30 - 03:40 they make sure that an infrared camera is strapped to the bottom. With the camera recording, they found the Tic Tac again. Okay, so now we're looking at real data, real evidence that we can analyze, Time: 03:40 - 03:50 get us away from relying on someone else's memory. What you're seeing is an object that is somehow flying through the sky. Time: 03:50 - 04:00 These infrared cameras will usually show a heat signature of exhaust or some kind of energy that shows how an aircraft is being propelled, something. But here, there's nothing. And yet suddenly, this object in the blink of an eye Time: 04:00 - 04:10 blasts away. And to be clear, we just showed you the raw clip. We didn't edit this in any way. This was back in 2004, Time: 04:10 - 04:20 but no one knew about it and likely never would until it was leaked in 2007 on a fringe UFO website called Above Top Secret. It honestly looked like some kind of BS conspiracy UFO stuff, totally disregarded. Time: 04:20 - 04:30 But 10 years later, the Pentagon confirmed that, actually, it's totally legit. This is authentic Navy footage recorded by Time: 04:30 - 04:40 some of the best pilots on earth showing an unidentified flying object. \"The New York Times\" would go on to report on this pretty deeply and revealed that this video, as well as the firsthand accounts Time: 04:40 - 04:50 by people who saw this object, would lead the Pentagon to create a secret program to study what's happening here. And not just this encounter, but dozens of others. Something the public wouldn't hear about until recently. Time: 04:50 - 05:00 And that's what this video is about. - [Reporter] US military officials have gone before a Congress hearing, releasing once classified videos from fighter pilots' cockpits. Time: 05:00 - 05:10 - [Reporter 2] 144 unexplained sightings. (speech muffled by static) Time: 05:10 - 05:20 - Wait, pause. Yes, I know some of you are asking, am I actually doing this? Yes, I'm actually doing this. We're doing a deep dive on UFOs and no, Time: 05:20 - 05:30 it's not some bait and switch storytelling device where I try to trick you into believing me and then, like, tell you to not believe everything you see. I'm actually doing this. I'm applying my journalistic lens to a topic Time: 05:30 - 05:40 that, in my opinion, has been thoroughly bastardized and sensationalized by the likes of the History Channel, UFO fanatics and Hollywood. I wanna do the opposite of all of that. I wanna actually evaluate the facts, because, honestly, Time: 05:40 - 05:50 there are some really compelling facts here. So this is not Roswell. It's not aliens landing at a school in Zimbabwe. It's not Bob Lazar claiming that he worked on UFO tech Time: 05:50 - 06:00 back in the '70s. I'm not touching any of that stuff. Maybe if this video does well, I will open up those cans of worms. Today, all I'm looking at are the hundreds of evidence-based sightings of stuff flying around in the air Time: 06:00 - 06:10 that the US military has observed but has concluded they don't know what it is. That's it. Let's do this. Time: 06:10 - 06:20 Oh, and by the way, next week's video is live right now over on Nebula. You can watch it ad free right this minute if you go sign up for Nebula. Link in the description, no code necessary. Time: 06:20 - 06:30 Okay, let's get back to it. In many ways, the 2004 Tic Tac event is the starting point for a new era of UFO investigations. And again, big props to \"The New York Times\" Time: 06:30 - 06:40 for breaking the news that the Pentagon had been investigating UFOs in secret since at least 2007. It was a program that Harry Reid, a Democratic senator from Nevada, had personally been asking for. Time: 06:40 - 06:50 Big alien guy, that Harry Reid, huh? \"The Times\" reporting also revealed that there were other videos. In 2014, a Navy jet was chasing a fleet of strange objects Time: 06:50 - 07:00 on the east coast of the United States. I mean, listen to this radio chatter. - [Pilot] There's a whole fleet of them. Look on the ASA. - [Pilot 2] Oh my gosh. Time: 07:00 - 07:10 They're all going against the wind. The wind's 120 knots from the west. - [Pilot] Well if there's- - [Pilot 2] Look at that thing. - [Pilot] It's rotating. - The next year in the same area, a Navy pilot captured a small round object Time: 07:10 - 07:20 traveling at what looks like very high speeds over the water. - [Pilot 3] Whoa! Got it. Woo hoo! Time: 07:20 - 07:30 What the fuck is that thing? - [Pilot 4] Did you box a moving target? - [Pilot 3] No, I took an auto- track. - [Pilot 4] Oh, okay. Time: 07:30 - 07:40 - [Pilot 3] Oh my gosh, dude. Wow. (speech muffled by static) - [Pilot 4] Look at that fly. - In 2019, some Navy sailors were on board this destroyer Time: 07:40 - 07:50 when they pointed a camera through their night vision goggles and captured this video. On March 4th, 2019, a weapons officer Time: 07:50 - 08:00 sitting in the back of a fighter jet captured these pictures of a quote, \"metallic blimp, a sphere and an acorn.\" And then, there was this incident in 2021 Time: 08:00 - 08:10 where a Navy pilot was filming out his window with a phone and caught this. Yeah, you probably missed it. Let's just slow that down. This. Like, what is this thing? Time: 08:10 - 08:20 These videos and images were shot by Navy pilots who were on duty and have confirmed to be authentic by the United States government. And these are just a few of hundreds of sightings Time: 08:20 - 08:30 under investigation by the Navy, many of which remained classified for, we all know what I'm gonna say, national security reasons. Not undermining it. I'm just saying like, ugh. Time: 08:30 - 08:40 It's just like the catchall for all things I want to know. Got a little outta control there. (suspenseful music) As more and more of these unidentified flying objects Time: 08:40 - 08:50 were being reported and talked about in the public, the Department of Defense finally assembled an official unidentified aerial phenomenon task force. UAPs is what the government now calls UFOs Time: 08:50 - 09:00 because UFOs, you know, again, has been completely tainted by this stuff. - [Narrator] A UFO sighting over multiple cities. Time: 09:00 - 09:10 - [Speaker 2] I don't know what the hell it is. - [Narrator] An extraterrestrial event that changed the course of history and an alien abduction witnessed by no less than six people. Time: 09:10 - 09:20 - When you read through these reports and you can start to see why the government wants to study this stuff. And no, it's not just because Harry Reid is, like, Time: 09:20 - 09:30 into aliens or whatever. The government says it itself that it's interested in this because of national security. Who's flying around in our airspace without our authorization, and why are they behaving in weird ways Time: 09:30 - 09:40 that we don't understand? But they also mention the safety of their pilots and their very expensive hardware. This new committee has been coming out with reports, Time: 09:40 - 09:50 and they state very clearly why they're doing this. First, the Pentagon is worried that these UAPs may be quote, \"part of a foreign collection program or indicative of a major technological advancement Time: 09:50 - 10:00 by a potential adversary.\" Counterintelligence, quote, \"UAP pose a hazard to safety of flight and could pose a broader danger if some instances represent sophisticated collection Time: 10:00 - 10:10 against United States military activities by foreign governments, or,\" crucially, \"demonstrate a breakthrough aerospace technology Time: 10:10 - 10:20 by a potential adversary.\" Translation, we don't really know what these things are and that kind of scares us. Oh, and safety. Time: 10:20 - 10:30 - When do you start getting a thought that, like, what is, what the fuck is this thing? - So, that happened when we visually saw one. Time: 10:30 - 10:40 There were two aircraft from my squadron, VFA 11, and they flew, took off as a flight of two. That means they're essentially flying in a formation like this. And as they hit the area, Time: 10:40 - 10:50 one of these objects went right between the aircraft. - We have a very strict system for controlling who is flying in our airspace to make sure that things don't run into each other Time: 10:50 - 11:00 because random stuff flying around could risk the lives of the pilots and these $67 million weapons. So, when something like this happens, it's a huge deal. They immediately abort whatever they're doing, Time: 11:00 - 11:10 and they return to their ship to, like, discuss what the hell just happened. - And you know, he was just sitting there saying, \"Hey, you know, I almost hit one of those damn things,\" and we all knew what he was referring to, Time: 11:10 - 11:20 even though we didn't necessarily have a name for it just because we were seeing these so much. And he described it, you know. He described it just as a black or dark gray cube. And that cube was inside of a clear or translucent sphere, Time: 11:20 - 11:30 and essentially the the apex with the corners of that cube, best he could tell, were touching that inside of that sphere. Time: 11:30 - 11:40 - Wait, hold on. Did you catch that? Not the weird cube inside of a translucent sphere, whatever. We'll get to that later. To me, what's actually more compelling about what this guy just said is. - Because we were seeing these so much. Time: 11:40 - 11:50 - He is saying that these pilots have been seeing these things. - You know, essentially, all the time. - Wow. Yeah. Like yeah, I get it. The translucent cube thing is, like, more tantalizing, Time: 11:50 - 12:00 but, like, the fact that these pilots report seeing these UAPs, these UFOs, all the time, day after day, week after week, that, to me, is more compelling evidence Time: 12:00 - 12:10 that we need to evaluate here. And, like the 2004 Tic Tac case that we talked about at the beginning. - This was happening because we upgraded our radar, the best we could tell. - These Navy personnel at first don't believe Time: 12:10 - 12:20 what they're seeing. They think that their instruments are probably broken. - And then people started to try to fly by it and see it. And at this point, you know, I would say maybe 80 to 90% of our squadron Time: 12:20 - 12:30 had probably seen one of these on the radar at this point. Everyone was aware of it. - So, according to some of these accounts, you've got a bunch of Navy pilots seeing weird stuff all the time, both on radar Time: 12:30 - 12:40 but also with their infrared cameras. But are you gonna be the guy who goes to your superior in the Navy and say, like, hey, I saw another UFO today. You don't wanna be like the UFO crazy. Time: 12:40 - 12:50 You're gonna get kicked out of the freaking, like, most superior pilot corps in the world because, like, you're seeing UFOs. These pilots have talked about how there's a real stigma Time: 12:50 - 13:00 with reporting this stuff, so a lot of 'em just sort of keep quiet. But it was when that near crash happened that now these pilots are literally required to file safety reports of what happened. Time: 13:00 - 13:10 And this is where the Pentagon and lawmakers who fund them were forced to take these UFOs more seriously. - We know that our service members have encountered unidentified aerial phenomenon, Time: 13:10 - 13:20 and because UAPs pose potential flight safety and general security risk, we are committed to a focused effort to determine their origins. - This is where I start to get pretty excited Time: 13:20 - 13:30 about the potential here because, look, this is like a real high up person in our intel community in the military who's talking about Time: 13:30 - 13:40 getting more data on this, on studying it. Keep going. Mr. Moultrie. - Our effort will include the thorough examination of adversarial platforms and potential breakthrough technologies, Time: 13:40 - 13:50 US government or commercial platforms, allied or partner systems and other natural phenomenon. - Scientists, military leaders, Time: 13:50 - 14:00 even some politicians are joining the crowd of true believers with the US Navy task force called in. - So, by 2020 this is now, like, becoming a thing, Time: 14:00 - 14:10 and this is probably why you've heard about it recently. This task force was formed, and it represents the first time since 1969 that the US government has officially or at least publicly acknowledged Time: 14:10 - 14:20 the significance of studying UFOs. - There is something there, measurable by multiple instruments, and yet, it seems to move in directions that are inconsistent with what we know of physics Time: 14:20 - 14:30 or science more broadly. And that, to me, poses questions of tremendous interest and, as well as potential national security significance. Time: 14:30 - 14:40 - Okay, wait, pause, just, yep. Inconsistent with the laws of physics. Yep. Very tantalizing. Let's just pause. We're talking about UFOs here, and I feel obligated Time: 14:40 - 14:50 to just check in and make sure we're all on the same page, okay? First, we know it is a fact that the US government has observed stuff in the air that they can't explain. Time: 14:50 - 15:00 The evidence that I've presented here is solid, solid sources, solid reporting. If I had evidence like this for any other story that I'm doing, I'd be like, this is solid evidence. Time: 15:00 - 15:10 Let's put it in the story. Okay? We know that it's true. (suspenseful music) Oh, and it's not just the few events that I've mentioned here. According to this report, there's been 144 Time: 15:10 - 15:20 of these instances either from the US military or government personnel, and 80 of these reports have been gathered from quote, \"multiple sensors,\" Time: 15:20 - 15:30 meaning from multiple perspectives, multiple perspectives or tools, which is like a thousand times better than, like, one pilot just saw something and is remembering it. Time: 15:30 - 15:40 Even if said pilot is someone like Lieutenant Commander Alex Dietrich, who, when you read this profile from \"The Washington Post\" on her, seems to be a pragmatic, highly credible Navy pilot from one of the most specialized flight programs Time: 15:40 - 15:50 in the world. - I don't identify as a UFO person. - Like, these pilots don't have incentives to make this stuff up. And yet, the fact remains that their instruments Time: 15:50 - 16:00 for measuring and observing the world is the human eyes, brain and long-term memory, which is a pretty faulty and inaccurate data collection tool. So, when I see something like 80 of these sightings Time: 16:00 - 16:10 being collected from multiple sensors, it makes all the difference for me. Okay, so that's number one. The US government has seen this. They don't know what it is, and it's been collected well. Number two, the other thing we know Time: 16:10 - 16:20 is that they've taken it seriously. This is a concern for them. The US Department of Defense is funding an effort to investigate, study and analyze what is happening here, Time: 16:20 - 16:30 which, again, is awesome. Funding research is the only way that we know anything about the world. It's so much better than hearing a few people riff on what they saw. Science and research is our best antidote Time: 16:30 - 16:40 to the faulty, story driven human brain. And indeed, the task force has come to some pretty useful conclusions. - Since the release of that preliminary report, Time: 16:40 - 16:50 UAP task force database has now grown to contain approximately 400 reports. - They went back and they looked at every one of these reports, analyzed all the data they could. Time: 16:50 - 17:00 And when you do that, you start to see these incidents come into perspective. Remember this video of the fast moving round thing that the pilot was freaking out about? Turns out that the Pentagon analyzed this, Time: 17:00 - 17:10 knowing everything they know about where the jets were and what tools were being used to record this moment. And they calculated that this was actually just, like, an optical illusion. Like, this object actually isn't moving that fast, Time: 17:10 - 17:20 only like 30 miles an hour. Or remember this video of the triangles in the sky filmed off of that destroyer? It turns out that this was more just quirky optics. - [Scott] We're now reasonably confident Time: 17:20 - 17:30 that these triangles correlate to unmanned aerial systems in the area. The triangular appearance is a result of light passing through the night vision goggles Time: 17:30 - 17:40 and then being recorded by an SLR camera. - These objects are probably foreign drones trying to spy on US military maneuvers, yet they might not be triangle in shape, Time: 17:40 - 17:50 but, like, that's still really useful information. We should know if there are foreign adversaries floating over our Navy destroyers. Or this video of a UFO shaped object being chased by an F-18. Time: 17:50 - 18:00 - [Pilot] There's a whole fleet of them. Look on the ASA. - What makes this video so weird is how the object is behaving, unexpected ways, kind of turning and rotating. Time: 18:00 - 18:10 - [Pilot 2] Look at that thing. - [Pilot] It's rotating. - Well, once again with a little bit of analysis, this weird movement is actually just another quirk of the image sensors that they use in the military Time: 18:10 - 18:20 on these specialized cameras that make objects look like they're moving in strange ways, when, really, if you just saw it with your eye, it wouldn't be that weird. There's this guy, Mick West, Time: 18:20 - 18:30 who's probably the most passionate debunker of, like, anything weird going on here. He does a really compelling deep dive on an explanation for this, why this object looks like it's moving so strangely. Time: 18:30 - 18:40 I mean if you want to go into it, it's like another optical mixed with camera sensors mixed with gimbal equipment and rotating compensation mechanisms. Yeah, you get the point, Time: 18:40 - 18:50 but we still don't know what this object is, but at least we have more clarity on why it looks weird to us with our eyes when we're watching on a video on the internet. The Pentagon recently came out and told \"The New York Times\" Time: 18:50 - 19:00 that most of this stuff is actually just foreign spies flying around, spying on US military activities or weather balloons Time: 19:00 - 19:10 or other airborne tracks, and further specifying that a lot of this stuff that looks weird to us looks weird because it was recorded on gear that is classified Time: 19:10 - 19:20 and is built for a specific purpose that we don't have access to understanding, leading to some strange looking imagery. Really convenient, Pentagon. And yet, another fact in all of this is that Time: 19:20 - 19:30 many of these videos have not been officially declared a foreign drone and, in fact, remain unexplained. And that's after analysis. Time: 19:30 - 19:40 One of those unexplained sightings was this one from 2004, the one we started this video on, the Tic Tac incident. (suspenseful music) Time: 19:40 - 19:50 The report often cites lack of good data and, indeed, what we have here is not the best, but we still have four sets of eyeballs. We have an official Navy report gathering facts Time: 19:50 - 20:00 from that day, technicians seeing this thing descend from 60,000 feet down to 50 feet in a matter of seconds, hovering stationary on the radar for a short amount of time Time: 20:00 - 20:10 and then departing at high velocities, high turn rates. This video, which is kind of uninspiring and grainy and not very long, but still shows us something, with its infrared not capturing any heat signature, Time: 20:10 - 20:20 any means of propulsion as this thing flies around at mind boggling speeds. Time: 20:20 - 20:30 Since these pilots went public with their account, a handful more of Navy witnesses have come forward telling their stories of what they have seen. And again, I take this all with a giant grain of salt, Time: 20:30 - 20:40 especially when you see some of these accounts putting fuel on the fire in the form of crazy claims that, I'm intentionally not gonna go into into them here because I consider them deeply outside of the realm Time: 20:40 - 20:50 of useful evidence. But yeah, if you're interested, you can easily go down the rabbit hole. This stuff is like clickbait for every human. If you do go down the rabbit hole on some of these other testimonies or witnesses, just be careful. Time: 20:50 - 21:00 This is powerful, intoxicating stuff. We all secretly want to believe that this isn't just, like, China spying on us. That's boring. Our brains are really good at filling in the gaps to construct a faulty narrative. Time: 21:00 - 21:10 Be careful. But yeah, that aside, there's still no satisfying theories that I could find that explain the 2004 Tic Tac case. Could be Russia or Chinese secret drones or even experimental aircraft Time: 21:10 - 21:20 that we ourselves have been developing. I mean, it's no secret that powerful countries spend a lot of time and resources trying to get a leg up militarily, trying to find Time: 21:20 - 21:30 the next big technological thing. Like, you can actually find patents from the US military that claim to revolutionize propulsion tech using, like, anti-gravity spacecraft, like, Time: 21:30 - 21:40 really out there, wild, weird, theoretical tech that may or may not exist. Again, another rabbit hole I'm not gonna go down. Time: 21:40 - 21:50 The 2004 Tic Tac case remains a mystery, and I have a feeling that it will be a mystery forever. We'll probably never know what this thing is, and that's because real answers only come Time: 21:50 - 22:00 when you have real inquiry with real tools to measure and analyze real data from the real world. People's eyes and brains and memories are about the worst thing you can count on, Time: 22:00 - 22:10 and yet, we can't ignore credible sources. - They were always out there, you know. - [Joe] Always. - They were out there when we took off. We'd see them and then we'd go to land. They would still be out there. - Like every day? Time: 22:10 - 22:20 - Every day. - But that's not proof of anything. To me, if they're always out there, we should be able to come up with a way to study them, and the US government agrees. - This often limited amount of high quality data Time: 22:20 - 22:30 and reporting hampers our ability to draw firm conclusions about the nature or intent of UAP . - Step one in all this is gonna be to decouple the study of UFOs, Time: 22:30 - 22:40 which is something we should totally do, from the quick conclusion that people jump to that we are being visited by aliens from a different star system. That is what created the stigma in the first place. Time: 22:40 - 22:50 That is why people are embarrassed to talk about this stuff. We need to decouple them. There are UFOs. We should study them and see what they actually are. But am I saying that these absolutely aren't alien spacecraft coming from other planets? Time: 22:50 - 23:00 No, I'm not saying that at all. I don't know. What I'm saying is that I haven't seen anything close to the burden of evidence required for me to believe Time: 23:00 - 23:10 that that's what these things are. What I have seen is evidence of weird, unidentified things flying around, behaving in ways that are potentially beyond our mainstream understanding of physics. Time: 23:10 - 23:20 I mean, potentially. So yes, I'm totally open to these things being aliens. I'm open to literally anything. My issue is that people see this, and our brains automatically do the easy thing, Time: 23:20 - 23:30 which is to fill in the blanks. Suddenly, aliens are the explanation. My brain does it, too. It scares me. It's not the right approach here. I mean, I'm aware that it literally is almost a statistical impossibility Time: 23:30 - 23:40 that we're the only intelligent life forms in this universe. Definitely not the the case. So yeah, maybe they found a way to travel to our little speck of dust planet, and they wanted to visit and look at us or something. Time: 23:40 - 23:50 I don't know. I'm totally open to it, but again, I have zero reason to believe that because there's no evidence that points to that as the explanation. - [Announcer] Seven, six, five. Time: 23:50 - 24:00 - But then there's the flip side, the juicier part of this for me, which is, who's to say we aren't the awe inspiring creatures ourselves? A hundred years ago, most people were still riding around on horses. Time: 24:00 - 24:10 They would've looked at our modern world, all of this and thought that, certainly, aliens had come to take over. Time: 24:10 - 24:20 Certainly, some crazy magician had come and reshaped the entire planet, and that's exactly what happened. Crazy scientific breakthroughs happen all the time. I mean, just this year, the Nobel Prize in physics Time: 24:20 - 24:30 went to a team of physicists laying the foundation for quantum communication, like real-time communication that essentially bypasses the classical laws of physics. Time: 24:30 - 24:40 What I'm trying to say here is we don't need to treat UFOs like religion. We don't need to believe. Instead of cobbling together the scant evidence that we have to fit some narrative that we want to believe, Time: 24:40 - 24:50 let's go out there and gather data and analyze it and build a body of knowledge about this. Let's poke at these phenomena and figure out what the hell is going on in our airspace, Time: 24:50 - 25:00 at the very least to keep us safe, but potentially so that we can discover something new, something that we can observe, measure, analyze and learn from. Time: 25:00 - 25:10 Wait, wait, wait, don't go yet. They released the report. The Pentagon released the report, like, right before we published this video. Like, we were waiting for them to release the report, and then they didn't. Time: 25:10 - 25:20 So, we filmed the video and I cut my hair, and then they released the freaking report about the update, the 2022 Annual Report on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena, Time: 25:20 - 25:30 UAP , baby. We've gone through this, and the update is that they're actually studying this stuff. This report goes through and shows a Pentagon that is very interested in doing more Time: 25:30 - 25:40 to gather data on this, which is really great news. There have been 366 new reports of UAP . They think that over half of them are, like, airborne clutter or drones or balloon like entities, Time: 25:40 - 25:50 but 171 of these reports remain totally unidentifiable. They don't know what they are, and they even mention that some of them continue to demonstrate quote, \"unusual flight characteristics.\" Time: 25:50 - 26:00 They even say that they're talking to allies about this to try to get to the bottom of what these UAP are. So yeah, the report is out. I'll link it in the sources. It's a pretty good read if you're into this stuff. Time: 26:00 - 26:10 I want to tell you that next week's video is live right now. You can watch it right this second. It's over on Nebula. I publish all of my videos a week early, Time: 26:10 - 26:20 and it's over on Nebula, no ads. The video is a map explainer that goes over all of the major coups that the US has committed over the years to, like, depose leaders and put in leaders that they like. Time: 26:20 - 26:30 Spoiler alert, there's been a bunch of 'em, and we mapped them. You can go watch that video right now, but it's not just me. All of my favorite creators are on Nebula, because it is a creator owned platform Time: 26:30 - 26:40 where we all publish our best stuff, not just our videos that we put here ad-free and early, but also originals, things that you can't find anywhere else, like RealLifeLore's \"Modern Conflicts\" Time: 26:40 - 26:50 or PolyMatter's \"China Actually.\" These are really cool series that you can't find anywhere else. Nebula is a giant repository of really amazing stuff. This video actually isn't sponsored by Nebula. Time: 26:50 - 27:00 The reason I'm plugging it right now is because I don't have a sponsor for today. And I want to tell you that if you sign up for Nebula, not only do you get access to my videos a week early Time: 27:00 - 27:10 and ad free, as well as access to all this other amazing, exclusive content, but you're also directly supporting our channel. It's four bucks a month or 40 bucks a year, which is like $3 and 33 cents a month, Time: 27:10 - 27:20 and a portion of your subscription goes directly to funding the creation of more videos like this. This isn't some, like, venture backed, like, tech company. This is a creator owned streaming platform Time: 27:20 - 27:30 that we're all building together, and you subscribing to it not only gets you all these perks, but also helps support us. So, if that's interesting to you, I really appreciate it. Time: 27:30 - 27:40 (playful music) Time: 27:40 - 27:50Am I the only one who is not scared by the idea that those objects could be signs of extraterrestrial life, and is way more concerned by the fact that could be human stuff?",

00:30 but is generally happy let me explain go ahead take a good look i know everyone's already doing it anyway look at my hair i've never felt so conscious about my hair because i'm talking about Time: 00:30 - 00:40 it okay so five years ago i realized that i was in a cycle the cycle looked like this my head which produces natural protective oils Time: 00:40 - 00:50 would be washed with shampoo shampoo is just a chemical that attaches to these oils on your scalp and then when you wash that shampoo out the oils are attached to them and they Time: 00:50 - 01:00 leave gritting your head of oils the shampoo also cleans off any pollen or dust that's caught in your hair so my hair was now clean very clean oh yeah and this guy isn't me this is just a stock footage Time: 01:00 - 01:10 representation of me five years ago anyway then goes in the conditioner which coats your hair with silicone material that makes it shine and restores all of that shine that was Time: 01:10 - 01:20 lost from stripping away all of those oils man i haven't used conditioner in a very long time but i do remember that it makes your hair feel like silky butter Time: 01:20 - 01:30 silky butter is that even a thing okay so you strip away the oils you coat it with this shiny silky conditioner and then my hair would end up just being Time: 01:30 - 01:40 sort of like a fluff ball in order to style it i would put in some product like some fancy pomade i bought at some fancy barber in chicago this pomade is made of wait for it Time: 01:40 - 01:50 oil it is an oil based product i'm putting oil back in my hair after i just stripped it all out meanwhile my scalp is like whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa dude you just stripped away all this protective oil Time: 01:50 - 02:00 that we make to protect your scalp wtf and so it fires up its natural oil making machine to produce more oil for your hair so now you have double oil you've got the Time: 02:00 - 02:10 pomade and the natural oils so now by the end of the day you start to feel like your hair is super oily and greasy and you have all these Time: 02:10 - 02:20 messages about dirty hair being greasy and oily hey you have got creasy hair though bro oh come on man so what's the cure for this oily greasy dirty hair shampoo deep cleansing shampoo it helps Time: 02:20 - 02:30 take away the excess dirt and oils that can be inside your hair right i reckon we should give it a go and get washed up let's do it and the whole cycle starts over again in my mid-20s i also started to realize Time: 02:30 - 02:40 that my scalp was starting to become like itchy and flaky which is like so embarrassing so uncomfortable and yet luckily out there in the world there is a cure for Time: 02:40 - 02:50 this the problem of flaking dandruff can be solved with just regular use of procter gamble's new wonder shampoo head and shoulders okay listen just a Time: 02:50 - 03:00 quick moment to make it clear that this cycle is my hair experience which is based on not only my physiology and genetics but also on Time: 03:00 - 03:10 my standards and relationship to society and what society tells me to do with my hair so just to get this out of the way i'm not here to preach what's right for your scalp Time: 03:10 - 03:20 i'm simply telling you what's right for my scalp in fact there's this whole movement sort of a political movement around shampoo and not shampooing it's called no poo which is a very Time: 03:20 - 03:30 unfortunate name for this movement i'm not a part of that movement i'm not pushing that this isn't political for me i just want to tell you a story about the journey of my hair using Time: 03:30 - 03:40 a little bit of history and data and research and again most importantly my own experience of five years of not shampooing my hair okay so let's dive in Time: 03:40 - 03:50 let's get some context here human beings used to not wash their hair very much at all it was only by the 1970s when ads targeted mainly towards white women Time: 03:50 - 04:00 would come out saying that you needed to wash your hair every single day and that the dirt in your hair was like weighing it down Time: 04:00 - 04:10 and weigh hair down like this and that in order to prevent this weighing down and to get body you would have to use this product this also started a whole new set of Time: 04:10 - 04:20 messaging around greasy hair dirty hair which even saying it is like repulsive so demonizing the idea of greasy hair and pushing this daily shampoo regimen Time: 04:20 - 04:30 was seen as the only way to fight back against this greasy hair epidemic today americans wash their hair around five of the seven days of the Time: 04:30 - 04:40 week by the way that's about double how much they wash their hair on average in spain and italy and it's way more than the once a month americans used to wash their hair Time: 04:40 - 04:50 in the 30s so let me tell you the story of how this all went down because i didn't like grow up as a non-shampooer five years ago i had bought this really expensive fancy Time: 04:50 - 05:00 tea tree oil based dandruff shampoo because i had so much itchiness and flakiness everywhere i was so tired of that and i was so embarrassed by it so i was diligent Time: 05:00 - 05:10 i would wash my hair with this tea tree oil shampoo every day the marketing on this told me that i shouldn't use any other shampoos that all the other shampoos were the devil and that this was the Time: 05:10 - 05:20 only thing i could use to treat my dandruff i ran out of this shampoo while we were on like a trip so i couldn't order it and i was just like okay when i get back i'll order the shampoo and i'll get back onto it and it Time: 05:20 - 05:30 like took a while we were on some long trip i get back i forget to order the shampoo i was getting worried about this but soon after like three weeks of this sort of fear of using other Time: 05:30 - 05:40 shampoos i noticed that the itching started going away and that the greasy hair feel started to actually level out it was actually okay and i was Time: 05:40 - 05:50 secretly like oh and probably i probably just got used to it or something but the key moment happened when i went in to get a haircut having not washed my hair with shampoo for like a month i was actually really nervous and conscious of what the Time: 05:50 - 06:00 barber was gonna say to me and he didn't say anything so i asked him i was like hey how does my hair and scalp look to you and he was like looks good it's a little dry Time: 06:00 - 06:10 but overall pretty healthy and that was the moment for me i was like wait what this guy who sees like dozens of scalps every day dozens of scalps that's actually really gross Time: 06:10 - 06:20 like dozens of scallops i'm just not never gonna say that again this guy sees a lot of scallops every day and he had like blessed my unshampooed scalp and was like you're actually okay now let me just remind you that i've told Time: 06:20 - 06:30 some of my close friends this story before and they have tried it and it hasn't worked for them i'm not saying that this exact thing is going to work for you the reason i am making this video Time: 06:30 - 06:40 because i want us to have reasons to be skeptical of all the messages that we get fed around this topic nourishing damaged hair back to healthy life Time: 06:40 - 06:50 regular washing is the only way that you can get rid of that excess oil i feel no grease a few years ago i read this kind of obnoxious business book that said that the best way to market a Time: 06:50 - 07:00 product is to create a psychological trigger that makes people need your product the example used in the book was this toothpaste in like the 50s or 60s where the ad for Time: 07:00 - 07:10 this toothpaste called attention to this quote dangerous coding that robs the teeth of their whiteness like this film coding that's like on your Time: 07:10 - 07:20 teeth every time you eat and it's like dangerous and bad and socially unacceptable turns out that this dangerous film on your teeth is a harmless residue from food consumption Time: 07:20 - 07:30 and toothpaste doesn't remove it any better than eating an apple so yes you should totally brush your teeth but not because there's this dangerous residue and now i can't unfeel it the Time: 07:30 - 07:40 psychological trigger is baked in i can't not feel it and i feel judged because i maybe have this dangerous coding this same dynamic happens today with the 100 billion hair care industry they push all sorts of scary ideas about Time: 07:40 - 07:50 dirty things lurking in your hair that only their product can fix and they get very rich because of it telling you that you have grease in your Time: 07:50 - 08:00 hair makes you feel dirty psychologically and what it does is it turns these naturally occurring lipids or fats in your hair which are totally protective and naturally Time: 08:00 - 08:10 occurring into this gross feeling dangerous thing and more and more these commercials have these like fancy 3d diagrams to make it feel totally Time: 08:10 - 08:20 legit and medical there are medical things here like dandruff is a real skin disorder that's something that has real symptoms and should be treated in a real medical way by a professional Time: 08:20 - 08:30 not by a commercial with a fake doctor showing you 3d diagrams to sell a product and no this lady is not a Time: 08:30 - 08:40 legit doctor she's an actor while we're on the point of dandruff and itchy scalps let it be known that dry scalp which is not a skin disorder literally means that your you don't have enough hydration in your scalp is not Time: 08:40 - 08:50 dandruff but he's scratching his head could be dandruff and yet they share effectively the same symptoms itchy flaky but dry scalp unlike dandruff is caused in Time: 08:50 - 09:00 part by wait for it shampooing too much drying out your scalp by stripping it of its natural hydrating oils Time: 09:00 - 09:10 this was my problem in my 20s i didn't have dandruff i thought i had dandruff because i was shampooing my hair too much and it was drying out my scalp and making it dry and flaky all of this gets conflated when Time: 09:10 - 09:20 corporations present their advertisements as legit science that's meant to help you feel better but let's just quickly say it like it is the only thing they're doing Time: 09:20 - 09:30 is trying to sell you a product to make sure that you feel like you need it as much as possible where this becomes totally below the belt in my view is when these commercials tell the story of how you Time: 09:30 - 09:40 will be socially ostracized if you don't use their product use head and shoulders every day and this gets to the last point i want to make here and potentially the biggest Time: 09:40 - 09:50 reason why i made this video i don't care about you shampooing your hair you probably should i you need to just determine that on your own but let us just recognize that we are social animals we live Time: 09:50 -

I use a shampoo, but without the SLS stuff, and recommend it to my customers because it\nalso will not strip out the colour they have paid me to apply ! Conditioners - well a shampoo will open up\nthe outer layer of your hair, and a conditioner closes it back, but with longer hair, it also helps add oils that\nmay be missing, due to the hairs age - and what we do to it. Not all contain silicones - and they are bad for\nit.

00:30 like i was a couple of years ago who is questioning and wondering can have another perspective to lean on i'm not looking to get into debates or to talk about the history or the theology Time: 00:30 - 00:40 of the church i'll do that in future videos today all i want to do is tell you the story of how and why i left the mormon church 23rd of Time: 00:40 - 00:50 may 2009 Time: 00:50 - 01:00 i grew up mormon both my parents were at mormon or lds latter-day saints i grew up going to mormon youth camp i then eventually Time: 01:00 - 01:10 served a two-year mission in tijuana mexico where for two years i went around and spoke to people in spanish about the Time: 01:10 - 01:20 church and learned a lot learned to speak spanish fluently keris how you feel malicious Time: 01:20 - 01:30 i then went to the mormon university called brigham young university in provo utah where i graduated i went through all mormon rituals in the Time: 01:30 - 01:40 church and temple i worked in the temple as a volunteer for a time i was very very mormon and i believed it Time: 01:40 - 01:50 i believed deeply in the unique doctrine of the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints which is a christian organization unlike any other christian organization in its Time: 01:50 - 02:00 doctrine [Music] the story of how i decided to leave this really begins with the birth Time: 02:00 - 02:10 of my son [Music] isabel who also grew up mormon and i got Time: 02:10 - 02:20 married in the temple which is a huge mormon ritual it's a huge part of being in the church we got married in the temple we went back to byu together and a few weeks before we graduated from byu Time: 02:20 - 02:30 we had a baby or izzy had a baby i didn't have a baby she had a baby then we took finals and graduated like literally two weeks later Time: 02:30 - 02:40 here we are literally in our cap and gown with henry who is like two weeks old after we graduated we moved out to washington dc and that's when my Time: 02:40 - 02:50 wheels really started to turn i started to think you know i have a child now i have to decide how i raise this child and what i teach him about Time: 02:50 - 03:00 the world i think having henry really made me wonder and think about how i should Time: 03:00 - 03:10 teach him about the world i had grown up with this firm conviction of the lds doctrine and its beliefs about the world which are very specific Time: 03:10 - 03:20 and very peculiar and i really started to question is this what i want to teach my son and the answer initially was yes i want to teach him everything that i know about this Time: 03:20 - 03:30 faith because i really believed it so we're moving out to washington dc and i realized that if i'm going to teach this to my son i need to Time: 03:30 - 03:40 double down on my faith i need to go deeper than i ever have and really really establish a strong foundation and conviction around this doctrine i had one but i knew it needed to be Time: 03:40 - 03:50 stronger if i was going to teach my son this one of the things i loved about mormon doctrine at the time was that there was always a push to ask god if it was true Time: 03:50 - 04:00 not to trust any people or any organization but to like get on your knees and say god is this true is this is this church actually real is that all of the things that they say Time: 04:00 - 04:10 actually the real deal i had kind of taken advantage of that promise before but never really i had always been in a setting of Time: 04:10 - 04:20 pressure whether it was my home as a kid or my mission or byu in other words there was always an incentive to believe so i'd never really been in a situation Time: 04:20 - 04:30 where i could truly ask this question and not feel like there was some price to pay if i decided i didn't believe being in Time: 04:30 - 04:40 washington dc with my child out on my own in the workforce was my opportunity so i spent an entire year reading the book of mormon going to church i had a responsibility at church Time: 04:40 - 04:50 that i was putting a lot of work into and praying every morning and every night for some sort of conviction i said i am more earnest and sincere than i've ever Time: 04:50 - 05:00 been about this i'm willing to listen to any answer i just need an answer i spent a year doing this a year it's a long time and then i remember Time: 05:00 - 05:10 this day i was biking into washington dc um on a sunny like spring day and Time: 05:10 - 05:20 it just hit me in some really strong way that no this isn't working i've put in the years of asking and the Time: 05:20 - 05:30 effort towards making this work and it wasn't working this isn't true for me and like a switch Time: 05:30 - 05:40 it just so much came out of me and i quickly decided that i was done i don't think it was all Time: 05:40 - 05:50 at once i think i had been slowly moving in this direction for a long time but in a moment of clarity it clicked for me in a very satisfying and like very true Time: 05:50 - 06:00 way so is who is is he isabelle whatever you want to call her my wife it didn't click for her she was not on this journey that i was on Time: 06:00 - 06:10 and i came back and i told her i said i think i am done being mormon and i had always been the sort of more devout convicted mormon and she was just like Time: 06:10 - 06:20 what like you just like have decided to be out of the church and she she full on said like this this is gonna end our marriage like you can't just leave the church and Time: 06:20 - 06:30 i just told her i said this is where i stand and this is what i feel and i felt very strongly about it luckily soon enough izzy was on her own path of reconciling her thoughts about the Time: 06:30 - 06:40 church her qualms with the church and soon she would join me in this path towards leaving the church now i call it a path because that's Time: 06:40 - 06:50 exactly what it is leaving any orthodox religion is not easy there are layers and layers of psychological and cultural conditioning that you don't Time: 06:50 - 07:00 even realize is there until you start to peel it back so even though we started to leave the church we were still going to church every sunday which i don't really Time: 07:00 - 07:10 understand in retrospect all i can say is that like we were just that's what we did every sunday we went to church and there was some guilt if we didn't go to church and so we went to church but we slowly started to feel an Time: 07:10 - 07:20 emptiness towards it and over the course of six months we finally decided to stop going to church my behavior didn't change all of a Time: 07:20 - 07:30 sudden like i didn't leave the church so i could start drinking alcohol or coffee or smoking like that was not a part of the agenda for me i kind of just carried on exactly how i Time: 07:30 - 07:40 had always been except for now i looked around in the world and i didn't have a doctrinal theological framework to understand it which was at once exhilarating and Time: 07:40 - 07:50 horrifying at the same time my existential view had been so neatly packaged by the plan of salvation which is the key doctrinal Time: 07:50 - 08:00 framework within the mormon church and that was now gone i had no plan i had no framework to make sense of the world exhilarating but horrifying there was Time: 08:00 - 08:10 also a deep fear of the cultural and social repercussions of my decision most of my friends were still lds or Time: 08:10 - 08:20 mormon and of course my family was too so was izzy's and let me just try to give you a perspective on why this is such a big deal a quick primer on mormon theology is Time: 08:20 - 08:30 that our whole purpose in life is to come down here to earth to learn and to grow and to progress and to attain knowledge and to fulfill certain Time: 08:30 - 08:40 we call them covenants or rituals there are four of them that are really important to do while you're on earth baptism confirmation this hour-long Time: 08:40 - 08:50 ritual inside the temple and then called the endowment and then the ceiling or marriage if you can do those four things then Time: 08:50 - 09:00 you're in really good shape you have the knowledge necessary to go back and live in the top tier of heaven and yes in mormon theology there are multiple tiers of heaven Time: 09:00 - 09:10 if you're not able to get these rituals done while you're on earth no worries when you're in the next life people on earth can do all the rituals for you while when you're dead and then you can Time: 09:10 - 09:20 have those the chance to accept those rituals or those covenants when you're on the other side it's a huge deal i had gone through all Time: 09:20 - 09:30 of the rituals i had accepted all of those covenants which are very serious covenants you wear undergarments that are symbolic of those covenants that you've made Time: 09:30 - 09:40 people call them like secret underwear or whatever but it was just religious clothing that symbolizes your commitment to these doctrines and the beauty of all of this Time: 09:40 - 09:50 within mormon doctrine is if you do this and everyone in your family does this then all of you are sealed together in this never-ending chain of eternal Time: 09:50 - 10:00 family that is at the epicenter of mormon doctrines if you know mormons and you know that they are family centered it's because of this the whole doctrine is based on Time: 10:00 - 10:10 creating family units that are all tied into this this covenant these promises that bind you that seal you together for time and all eternity Time: 10:10 - 10:20 if you've accepted those covenants and then you leave you break away you reject those covenants you take off your garments you say i'm done with this Time: 10:20 - 10:30 that's a pretty big deal within the lds framework you are no longer able to be with your family in the celestial glory Time: 10:30 - 10:40 of the top tier of heaven so if you believe that and you're a parent and you see your child rejecting those covenants rejecting that eternal ceiling to the Time: 10:40 - 10:50 family you're basically seeing your child go away and you feel like you're losing them so unsurprisingly people leaving the mormon Time: 10:50 - 11:00 church creates huge upset within families like many other religions it's not just an insular cultural experience it is a deeply held doctrinal Time: 11:00 - 11:10 theological belief that if you leave the church there are major consequences luckily i had parents who Time: 11:10 - 11:20 by the time i told them that i was leaving the church were very open and loving and accepting of my decision certainly it was hurtful for them but they did not Time: 11:20 - 11:30 project that onto me in any way that made me feel ostracized unfortunately that is not the case for a lot of my friends a lot of other people who have left the church Time: 11:30 - 11:40 but even still with parents who were accepting and loving despite my decision i still had years of purging and Time: 11:40 - 11:50 processing to do something that continues to this day now four or five years later what i didn't realize is that i had internalized a lot of assumptions Time: 11:50 - 12:00 of shame and guilt and fear and judgment that i didn't even realize i had and for the years following leaving the Time: 12:00 - 12:10 church it was a process of slowly purging and peeling back and processing those things i went through the mr nice guy Time: 12:10 - 12:20 phase which is a very common thing for people who leave the lds church which is like i'm just leaving the church nice and peaceful i'm going to not be mean i'm not going to be spiteful towards the church because Time: 12:20 - 12:30 in the church when you're in it there's sort of this like like archetype of the spiteful angry anti- mormon who goes out and spreads Time: 12:30 - 12:40 lies about the church and they're just offended and angry and and i didn't want to be that person i don't want to be that archetype and so i tried to maintain very cordial relationships with everybody Time: 12:40 - 12:50 i tried to be super nice like you know the church was really great for me and and yet i just you know disagreed with it so i walked away i went through that phase for a couple of years Time: 12:50 - 13:00 but through therapy and through a lot of thinking about this i came to understand that i actually had some deep problems and anger towards the Time: 13:00 - 13:10 church and what it instilled in me i had anger and resentment towards a lot of the authority structures that made me feel unclean or dirty i had Time: 13:10 - 13:20 anger towards the systems that made me feel like obedience was the most important thing that submission to allah from god was much more important than self-expression and self- actualization Time: 13:20 - 13:30 i developed a resentment towards the church structure that has very homophobic and heteronormative Time: 13:30 - 13:40 and misogynistic structures that taught me to think in those terms a church that purports to love everybody but deeply condemns certain people because of who Time: 13:40 - 13:50 they love i'd rewire so much of that upon leaving and perhaps most frustratingly and maybe this is going to be hard to communicate the nuance to to someone Time: 13:50 - 14:00 who's not lds but i felt deep frustration at the church's claim to have a monopoly over the fullness of truth that the few Time: 14:00 - 14:10 million members are the only keepers of the real truth of what god wants today for us and that everyone else has truth too Time: 14:10 - 14:20 but through prophets and apostles and modern-day revelation the mormons are actually the ones who have the full picture they know what's going on i believed Time: 14:20 - 14:30 that they had the truth that was going to deliver me and my family to eternal bliss in celestial glory i believed that and i modeled my life Time: 14:30 - 14:40 around it deep into my adulthood and i feel resentment that i did that and that the stakes were so high for leaving for expressing myself and my qualms for Time: 14:40 - 14:50 this doctrine because after all if you question it you're questioning prophets people who are talking to god you can't do that it all left me very confused and Time: 14:50 - 15:00 required a lot of healing and processing in that is still going on and let me just be clear about something this isn't Time: 15:00 - 15:10 my millennial brain trying to reject authority structures and subvert old institutions like it's happening in a lot of religious contexts Time: 15:10 - 15:20 right now a lot of people are leaving religion i wasn't trying to get away from some disciplined structure my life is still a disciplined structure i still have a lot of the artifacts from my mormon Time: 15:20 - 15:30 upbringing what i was fleeing when i left the mormon church was a structure that i feel like put down who i really was made me cover it up in the name of a Time: 15:30 - 15:40 broader vision of what righteousness is and what jesus wants me to do it wasn't me it was harmful towards me Time: 15:40 - 15:50 and it was harmful towards others and the consequences were severe if you spoke up and you challenged the status quo the culture is not one of discourse and Time: 15:50 - 16:00 debate it's one of obedience obedience obedience obedience obedience is a hallmark belief and tenet of the lds experience Time: 16:00 - 16:10 and as a member you feel it leaving the church is painful socially mentally Time: 16:10 - 16:20 you experience a cost for doing so and if you're in that situation now which i know some of those watching are where you know that your family Time: 16:20 - 16:30 and your peers will think differently of you if you decide to leave just know that it's a lot better on the other side if you choose yourself Time: 16:30 - 16:40 and you choose your personal experience and your personal expression and you honor that as opposed to honoring the fear of obedience Time: 16:40 - 16:50 there's some years of pain and adjustment but there is a sense of freedom on the other side this is uncomfortable for me to say even right now i'm imagining Time: 16:50 - 17:00 whether it's family or friends who are still active believers in the church watching this i can feel that discomfort even now years later of what are they thinking of Time: 17:00 - 17:10 me making this video and and effectively talking to others who might be in the church and telling them to leave that that old archetype of the bitter Time: 17:10 - 17:20 ex-mormon who's polarizing and an extremist is is is ringing in my ears and yet day by day those voices and those old models Time: 17:20 - 17:30 they dissolve more and more and they become less loud and they become less part of my identity i for many years did identify as someone who used to be mormon and now i'm not Time: 17:30 - 17:40 but yet with time i'm slowly developing my own new identity that isn't pinned to my reactionary experience with the church but it's just Time: 17:40 - 17:50 pinned to who i am what i love i'm a father who loves my children i love to learn about the world and explore and explain things i love Time: 17:50 - 18:00 film i love animation i love moss i love cooking i love reading stories to my boys and teaching them about the world i love traveling i love Time: 18:00 - 18:10 trains i love science i love the beauty of our world and the mystery that it is and the mystery of life Time: 18:10 - 18:20 and cultures that appreciation is enough for me i don't have a spiritual framework to fill the vacuum i haven't joined some religion Time: 18:20 - 18:30 maybe someday i will maybe i'll develop that but for now the wonder of the world outside of the plan of salvation and god looking out over his children Time: 18:30 - 18:40 for this big plan of obedience outside of that i feel like there is plenty to stand in awe of and love without Time: 18:40 - 18:50 a god and a savior to create meaning for me and yet there's a strange paradox within all of this that i have to talk about which is the mormon Time: 18:50 - 19:00 experience also gave me so much my mission while i feel conflicted about what i was doing and how i was doing it Time: 19:00 - 19:10 i learned to work hard i learned to speak spanish i learned to navigate in cultural experiences outside of my own i was in tijuana for two years next to a Time: 19:10 - 19:20 giant international border one of the most violent and intense borders on earth and that instilled a love for the stories of people who live near borders Time: 19:20 - 19:30 which helped create my career my parents raising me in that environment gave me beautiful experiences Time: 19:30 - 19:40 and community taught me how to be industrious and hardworking and disciplined it taught me how to care and love and serve others Time: 19:40 - 19:50 those are all good things so how do i reconcile the pain and the psychological confusion that this organization Time: 19:50 - 20:00 brought to my life packaged tightly with the reality of all of the beautiful things that i brought to my life the good the community the memories Time: 20:00 - 20:10 the values of honesty and service in love that's a paradox that will probably be with me forever it's impossible to summarize this Time: 20:10 - 20:20 experience as one thing good or bad and that's okay that dissonance is okay so that's a little bit of my story Time: 20:20 - 20:30 and my thoughts around why i left the mormon church i want to hear from you especially those who have experience with this and can speak about the complexities i also want Time: 20:30 - 20:40 to hear from those who have questions and are worried or scared this isn't an easy decision i also want to hear from those who have experience with this Time: 20:40 - 20:50 whether it's from the mormon church or any other orthodox insular religion or culture breaking out of those systems is hard Time: 20:50 - 21:00 and sometimes not worth it but sometimes it is sometimes it's worth it and sometimes on the other side of that hard journey there is a much brighter future Time: 21:00 - 21:10 hey thanks for listening everybody um before you go i want to thank today's sponsor audible which is Time: 21:10 - 21:20 something i've been using for it feels like eight years of my life audible is a giant repository of amazing audiobooks and other audio Time: 21:20 -

      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:10 Storm no I've grown tired of hearing the name Elon Musk and not really understanding what's going on who is this guy where is Time: 00:10 - 00:20 he from how has he built a huge business Empire to become one of the richest people in the world and what can we learn about his purchase of Twitter so I've been going on a deep dive finding Time: 00:20 - 00:30 everything I can about this guy his upbringing businesses he started talking to people who have worked with him who have worked for him many of these people want to remain anonymous for reasons you Time: 00:30 - 00:40 will soon understand I've talked to people who love him people who hate him people who used to love him and now hate him if I were an employee at Twitter right now I'd probably just do your job Time: 00:40 - 00:50 don't let him know your name so after a few months of reporting on this I feel like I finally have a handle on who this guy is I understand how he built his Time: 00:50 - 01:00 Empire how he treats the people around him and the real reason I believe he bought Twitter Elon Musk put in an offer unsolicited bid to buy the social media Time: 01:00 - 01:10 platform 44 billion so let me show you the rise and Rule of Elon Musk you're a super villain that's what a super villain does Time: 01:10 - 01:20 yeah he's addicted to drama who's addicted to risk and when everything seem to be going smoothly he almost has a comp pulsion toore things Time: 01:20 - 01:30 [Music] Time: 01:30 - 01:40 up Elon Musk was born in the summer of 1971 in South Africa from a young age he was bullied pretty relentlessly by kids at school for being scrawny and nerdy I Time: 01:40 - 01:50 was you know bullied quite a lot I punched the face many times musk would later say that he's on the autism spectrum though he was never diagnosed it really bad for young Elon like one Time: 01:50 - 02:00 time when he got beaten up at school once and so bloodied he had to go to the hospital the scars were actually worse when he came home and his father made Time: 02:00 - 02:10 him stand in front of him and berated him for more than an hour calling him stupid saying it was his fault stories like this make me sick to my stomach and Time: 02:10 - 02:20 you realize that the trauma and scars from this kind of abuse both physical and emotional they don't go away easily Time: 02:20 - 02:30 speaking of his dad there's a lot of rumors that Elon came from a rich dad who owned Emerald mines in South Africa and that he was set up to be successful Time: 02:30 - 02:40 because of family wealth this isn't factually accurate elon's dad did import emeralds but there wasn't a lot of money in this family he never owned a a a Time: 02:40 - 02:50 emerald mine this is total if you want more detail on that you can go check out our sources where we put the fact check for every one of the assertion in this video anyway what Elon Time: 02:50 - 03:00 did have at a young age was a skill for computers and programming I told myself how to program Time: 03:00 - 03:10 computers mostly cuz I wanted to program games at the age of 12 he invented a video game mom do you remember when I was 12 and I created my own video game that he sold to a magazine for $500 it Time: 03:10 - 03:20 was his first business move in Tech his first interest in space around 12 or 13 I had compan EX itial crisis Time: 03:20 - 03:30 trying to figure out the meaning of life from an early age musk found meaning in the idea of the potential of humanity what humans can do as a collective how Time: 03:30 - 03:40 we as a species have somehow been able to work together to explore the meaning of the universe my motivation was that Time: 03:40 - 03:50 if we can expand the scope and scale of Consciousness maybe we can find out the meaning of life I mean you hear this and it kind of sounds overly Grand kind of delusional overly idealistic Time: 03:50 - 04:00 but honestly this is what motivates Musk from a very young age and he doesn't bend on what he wants and what he's willing to do to achieve Time: 04:00 - 04:10 it so he leaves South Africa when he's 18 and moves to Canada and eventually ends up in Pennsylvania where he goes to college and gets a degree in economics and physics at the age of 24 he moves Time: 04:10 - 04:20 out to California to pursue a PhD at Stanford but he never starts the program instead he starts his first business Time: 04:20 - 04:30 okay so I'm not going to go into the details of every one of elon's companies because there are a lot if you want to Deep dive read this very thick book this Time: 04:30 - 04:40 was a foundational part of our reporting and it details the play-by-play on all of these companies for now let me give you a quick summary of the businesses Time: 04:40 - 04:50 this guy built to become one of the richest men on the planet his first company was called zip 2 he started it in 1995 with his brother who seems to Time: 04:50 - 05:00 have an affinity for cowboy hats his company provided maps and business directories for online newspapers I know those words sound very Time: 05:00 - 05:10 strange to us now but like back in 1995 it was a huge deal it almost was like the precursor to what Google Maps is today and it was very successful we helped bring online several hundred uh Time: 05:10 - 05:20 newspapers that previously were only in it was acquired a few years later for $37 million 22 million of those dollars going right into elon's pocket suddenly Time: 05:20 - 05:30 Elon is Rich receiving cash is cash I mean those are just a large number of Van Franklin he uses the money to start another company called x.com no no no Time: 05:30 - 05:40 not that x.com the first x.com which you now know today as PayPal so this is an ATM what we're going to do is transform Time: 05:40 - 05:50 the traditional banking industry it was basically an online bank and it was revolutionary at the time so much so that in 2002 eBay bought it for 1 .5 Time: 05:50 - 06:00 billion Elon got $180 million of those dollars and now he's officially Super Rich there is jlan the fastest car in the world so what to do with all of this Time: 06:00 - 06:10 money the answer for Elon Musk was to try out the craziest ideas he could think of well I had like about 180 million from PayPal I thought you know I'll allocate half of that to SpaceX and Time: 06:10 - 06:20 Tesla and Solar City that should be fine I'll have 90 million lik just Lots I thought our probability of success was less than 10% it would be foolish to think anything else other than Time: 06:20 - 06:30 that ever since he was a kid making video games about space Elon has been motivated by this idea of humans expanding outside of Earth humans Time: 06:30 - 06:40 becoming a multiplet species we would like to help make life multiplanetary the extension of life to multiple planets in the early 2000s Tesla already Time: 06:40 - 06:50 existed they were making electric cars but they were kind of high-end Niche sports cars Elon was really interested in this so he came in as an investor and eventually became the CEO with the Time: 06:50 - 07:00 vision of turning electric cars mainstream and ushering a whole new era of Transportation but these ideas were more expensive than he anticipated Time: 07:00 - 07:10 things cost more and took longer than than I thought so I had a choice of either put the rest of the money in or the companies are going to die his Rockets kept blowing up his electric Time: 07:10 - 07:20 cars were devilishly complicated to manufacture but Elon developed this addiction to risk and intensity that kept him pushing forward despite these Time: 07:20 - 07:30 challenges Tesla reinvented how cars were made thanks to Innovative Technology and Manufacturing really clever engineering and a waterfall of government subsidies he was able to Time: 07:30 - 07:40 Skyrocket Tesla into one of the most valuable companies in the world overtaking every other car company by a long shot in just a few years and this Time: 07:40 - 07:50 company was weird it wasn't obeying all the rules like there was almost no official marketing campaign and Elon decided to make all of his technology Time: 07:50 - 08:00 open source the patents were not copyrighted anyone could see them and use them with the hope that the market for electric vehicles would take off and that the world would more quickly move Time: 08:00 - 08:10 away from the use of fossil fuels which would ultimately benefit Tesla so if somebody comes and makes a better electric car that than than Tesla and it's it's so much better than ours that we can't sell our cars and and we go Time: 08:10 - 08:20 bankrupt I still think that's a good thing for the world these were bold crazy moves but they were totally working meanwhile elon's space company Time: 08:20 - 08:30 was about to go out of business for SpaceX first three launches failed just barely able to scrape Time: 08:30 - 08:40 together enough parts and and money to do the the fourth launch and then after 6 years and 6 months of stress and intensity elon's dreams of going to Time: 08:40 - 08:50 space started to come true [Music] Time: 08:50 - 09:00 [Music] [Applause] I'm going to explain a little bit more about how he did all of this but the big Time: 09:00 - 09:10 deal about SpaceX is that they created a reusable rocket every other rocket is disposable you can only use it once and it's very expensive but Elon proved that you could use a rocket and safely land Time: 09:10 - 09:20 it back down onto the surface of Earth and then use it again soon SpaceX would be carrying NASA astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station launching military satellites into space Time: 09:20 - 09:30 for the Pentagon launching dozens of satellites up into space for commercial use and even launching the first ever private space flight for tourism space travel was officially reinvented I think Time: 09:30 - 09:40 we're at the DOR of a new era and it's a reason for people to be excited and inspired to be human okay but what's crazy is that during all of this Elon is also launching a bunch of other companies like the boring company which Time: 09:40 - 09:50 is trying to revolutionize traffic and transportation by building smarter tunnels oh my God it just hit me that it's boring like boring into the side of Time: 09:50 - 10:00 a mountain oh my God that that just hit me right now this company also turned into like a Time: 10:00 - 10:10 blank canvas for Elon Musk to play out all of his childish silly ideas like selling a flamethrower or this perfume that smells like singed human hair and Time: 10:10 - 10:20 yes musk uses his businesses as kind of a way to troll Humanity while also trying to save Humanity it's this behavior that a lot of people find Time: 10:20 - 10:30 refreshing and ends up getting a lot of attention and becoming a marketing tool for all of his companies he starts building neuralink which is designing a way for humans to control computers with Time: 10:30 - 10:40 their brains which is already having some initial successes and now that elon's company can easily go to space he starts sending up these small satellites 6,000 of them that are orbiting the Time: 10:40 - 10:50 Earth and he starts providing internet to remote places arguably changing the course of the war in Ukraine by providing Ukrainian Soldiers with internet during the initial Invasion Time: 10:50 - 11:00 From Russia though that's gotten more complicated in recent months as Russian soldiers have started to use starlink and it's a whole other Rabbit Hole okay but we're not done yet with elon's companies he also co-founded open AI way Time: 11:00 - 11:10 back in 2015 who went on to make chat GPT he later left the company over disagreements and then has recently started his own AI company called you Time: 11:10 - 11:20 guessed it X AI yes the guy loves the letter X it's literally the name of several of his companies and one of his Time: 11:20 - 11:30 children each one of these Ventures points back to elon's Childish idealism this Grand Vision of testing the limits of what humans can do by pushing our Time: 11:30 - 11:40 understanding of physics and working together to do crazy amazing things but then after building all of these companies that are focused on pushing Time: 11:40 - 11:50 the physical limits of human potential Elon in recent years has set his sights on reshaping another industry Time: 11:50 - 12:00 tonight the richest man in the world is hunting for more put in an offer of almost $44 billion to buy Twitter all of Twitter is this all a troll or is this Time: 12:00 - 12:10 very real Elon Musk has been portrayed as both a reckless unethical billionaire as well as a Visionary who is changing the Time: 12:10 - 12:20 world for the better and what you think about him probably comes from what you read about him and what you read about him was probably served to you by an Time: 12:20 - 12:30 algorithm this is how our media landscape works these days and it's getting us deeper and deeper into trouble which is a major theme in this video but it's also in line with the Time: 12:30 - 12:40 sponsor of today's video which is ground news ground news is a platform that I've been using to navigate this problem to find a balanced view where I can see Time: 12:40 - 12:50 both sides of a new story ground news Aggregates tens of thousands of news articles from around the world into one place and then allows you to critically Time: 12:50 - 13:00 examine how that news is being covered here's a recent story that on the left you can see from the Los Angeles Times that Engineers Su Elon Musk and SpaceX Time: 13:00 - 13:10 saying that the company mirrored his juvenile crude xposts while on the right you've got the New York Post saying that Elon Musk was sued by fired Engineers Time: 13:10 - 13:20 alleging Elon Musk allowed pervasive sexist culture these headlines have subtle bias in them like the left leaning headlines suggests that musk's Time: 13:20 - 13:30 personal Behavior was directly responsible while the right leaning headline emphasizes that they were fired employees and that there was an alleged sexist culture softening any kind of Time: 13:30 - 13:40 blame towards musk and his company this is really subtle stuff that's hard to pay attention to if you're just scrolling your algorithm ground news emphasizes and highlights these biases Time: 13:40 - 13:50 and allows you to be more critical as a news consumer not only do they show this biased distribution but they also have a tool that rates how factual an article is and my favorite they have this blind Time: 13:50 - 14:00 spot detector that pays attention to the articles that you tend to read and presents you with stuff that might be outside of your comfort zone but that you probably need to see to be a Time: 14:00 -

14:30 that they sponsored today's video with that let's dive back into the story of Elon Musk tonight the richest man in the world is hunting for Time: 14:30 - 14:40 more okay so we're getting into this why did Elon buy Twitter what can we learn from it before we do that I want to tell you a little bit about what I learned Time: 14:40 - 14:50 about Elon Musk as a leader after talking to people who have worked with him people who have worked under him there's a few key lessons that I've taken taken away from all of these Time: 14:50 - 15:00 conversations we've had with these people and doing research on him I will not be quoting them directly because most of them ask to remain anonymous the first thing I heard over Time: 15:00 - 15:10 and over again is how obsessed Elon Musk is with the details of what his companies are building I think people think like I'm a business guy or something like that engineering that's Time: 15:10 - 15:20 like 80% more of my time One Source I talked to who worked closely with musk estimates that he spends 90% of his time in technical details with a whiteboard Time: 15:20 - 15:30 out looking at code with engineers and programmers solving very specific details in meetings that sometimes go into the middle of the night and this gets to our second takeway which is that Time: 15:30 - 15:40 Elon questions everything and I mean everything you can see this really clearly when he was building SpaceX it was tough going there in the beginning U because I'd never built anything Time: 15:40 - 15:50 physical I mean I'd built like little model rockets as a kid and that kind of thing but I'd never had a company that built anything physical elon's original idea for SpaceX was to buy Russian Time: 15:50 - 16:00 rockets that had been decommissioned and to rebuild them more efficiently I can tell you it was very weird going to the Russian rocket forces and saying I'd like to buy two of your biggest Rockets they thought I was crazy but but I did Time: 16:00 - 16:10 have money he went to Russia and quickly discovered that the price that governments pay for Rockets is astronomical it felt absurd on the Time: 16:10 - 16:20 flight home Elon makes this list of every component he can think of needed to build a rocket and then he put in the estimated price for just the mat materials and the components what he Time: 16:20 - 16:30 found is that the prices that they were quoting him for these rocket parts were highly inflated he interrogated every single cost associated with rockets and started to make plans on how his team Time: 16:30 - 16:40 could find a much cheaper way to build them he did this over and over and over until soon his team was manufacturing Time: 16:40 - 16:50 70% of all of the rocket components for SpaceX and saving millions of dollars I heard story after Story like this Elon showing up talking to some Time: 16:50 - 17:00 low-level engineer working on some very specific problem and interrogating it until he found the most efficient answer Time: 17:00 - 17:10 oh and this wasn't about him being collaborative or inclusive of his employees this is about him stress testing every single assumption pushing every single thing to the limit so that Time: 17:10 - 17:20 he can find the most efficient way to build something this also makes working for Elon incredibly stressful he'll show up he'll question everything and then he'll tell people that a 6-month Time: 17:20 - 17:30 timeline needs to be condensed down into 90 days everyone's jaw drops they say it's impossible and he says it has to be possible and then everyone makes it happen which gets me to number four the Time: 17:30 - 17:40 people around him musk's ruthless idealism and vision for the future has attracted a lot of really talented Time: 17:40 - 17:50 people who bring these dreams to life these people have rallied around his mission to reinvent Transportation or take humans to Mars they're the ones who make it happen with unprecedented speed Time: 17:50 - 18:00 and efficiency these four things are really his superpowers they are the ingredients that have allowed him to reinvent entire Industries but this Time: 18:00 - 18:10 isn't the full picture everyone I talk to includes the fact that Elon can be a total and is a lot of the time hate me like me or indifferent do you Time: 18:10 - 18:20 want the best car or do you not want the best car he is abrupt he is blunt and he puts basically no effort into making you like him no I am not the evil I just a Time: 18:20 - 18:30 misunderstood one irony I kept hearing is that musk cares so much about Humanity but he doesn't really care Time: 18:30 - 18:40 about humans okay so I'm the father of an 11-year-old who is autistic and I myself identify as being on some part of the spectrum and so listening to hours of musk I see moments that to most Time: 18:40 - 18:50 people might look like him being mean-hearted and arrogant and extreme and even cruel but to me feel more like him being unaware or perhaps unwilling Time: 18:50 - 19:00 to play by the rules of social norms okay but and because my son is probably watching this I need to make one thing crystal clear that there is a line here Time: 19:00 - 19:10 musk's Behavior especially recently can quickly cross into malicious temperamental mean-hearted and harmful Time: 19:10 - 19:20 behavior that goes well beyond anything that can be justified or explained by neurodivergence into something that looks a lot more like aggressive bullying coercion unethical business Time: 19:20 - 19:30 practices there's almost a Deon mode of Eli mus where it turns really dark and that can be very problematic especially when it came to acquiring Twitter my Time: 19:30 - 19:40 point is that there's some empathy that is warranted here it can be a blurry line but musk very clearly crosses that line something we'll talk about more in Time: 19:40 - 19:50 a little bit but for now let's get back to our list these five things that are the big takeaways on how musk operates and how he's built his Empire and let's look at where got him by the early Time: 19:50 - 20:00 2020s his four big companies had grown rapidly to become worth billions Tesla reaching a trillion doll valuation one of the most valuable companies on Earth Time: 20:00 - 20:10 revolutionizing the car industry and by January 2021 these successes had skyrocketed musk to become the world's richest man according to Forbes billionaire tracker but don't be fooled for musk Time: 20:10 - 20:20 this actually isn't an ideal situation musk's biographer Walter Isaacson wrote this amazing book book that details all of this private communication that Time: 20:20 - 20:30 really gives us an inside look into the psychology of musk during this time and he documents this conversation between Siobhan zillis the director of operations at one of his companies and Time: 20:30 - 20:40 the mother of a set of elon's twins and Elon in a text that read you don't have to be in a state of War all the time or is that where you find greater Comfort Time: 20:40 - 20:50 when you're in periods of war and he replies that it's a part of his default setting zillis then tells Isaac that it was like he was winning the Time: 20:50 - 21:00 simulation and now he felt at a loss at what to do extended periods of calm were unnerving for him the guy is addicted to conflict and crisis and tension and Time: 21:00 - 21:10 drama and being the world's richest man with all these successes was uncomfortable he needed a new storm to throw himself into and so he chose the Time: 21:10 - 21:20 storm of all [Music] storms at the end of 2022 he buys Twitter for $44 billion in his offer Time: 21:20 - 21:30 letter he tells us why he's doing it he believes that Twitter has the potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe and that free speech is Time: 21:30 - 21:40 a societal imperative for a functioning democracy and right away musk applies his Playbook to the company sending out Time: 21:40 - 21:50 a midnight email telling the thousands of employees that there's going to be a new Twitter culture that is quote extremely hardcore long hours high intensity and tells anyone who wants to Time: 21:50 - 22:00 stay to fill out this form or be fired thousands of Twitter employees are being laid off locked out of their work email accounts Twitter has fired half of its 7 Time: 22:00 - 22:10 and a half thousand staff we called it the Twitter Hunger Games I thought a lot about how to talk about musk's fora into Twitter because Time: 22:10 - 22:20 it is in the news right now it is shaping the way that we receive and talk about information and there's a lot of hot takes out there what I decided to do here is to try to give the most Earnest Time: 22:20 - 22:30 understanding as to musk's motives why did he do this what does he want from it and what is he doing to reshape Twitter around this Time: 22:30 - 22:40 Vision what was it ultimately that led you to make the decision to do it uh somewhat melodramatic but I was worried about that that it was Time: 22:40 - 22:50 having a corrosive effect on civilization so first and foremost free speech is like the thing he says over and over spech Free Speech Free Speech free speech is the only way that humans Time: 22:50 - 23:00 are going to thrive and because musk's main mission is the advancement of human civilization he must buy Twitter and make it the Free Speech platform the platform where we have perhaps the most Time: 23:00 - 23:10 important conversations in the world he says this over and over like in this tweet where he says this is a battle for the future of civilization if free speech is lost even in America tyranny Time: 23:10 - 23:20 is all that lies ahead so that's number one on what he says his motives are I think part of it is that it's where it's where it was located which is uh you Time: 23:20 - 23:30 know downtown San Francisco the next pillar of musk's reasoning has to do with the city of San Francisco is there a place that's more far left than San Francisco brookley Twitter's headquarters is Time: 23:30 - 23:40 located right here in downtown San Francisco and for musk that's a big problem it was an accidental far-left Time: 23:40 - 23:50 information weapon that was then harnessed by the farle who could not themselves create the weapon but happened to be collocated where the technologist were okay so let me get Time: 23:50 - 24:00 this straight musk believes that Twitter being in the heart of a liberal City means that the engineers and leaders deciding what gets elevated and suppressed on Twitter are infected with Time: 24:00 - 24:10 the politics of the liberal City and so they're more likely to elevate their ideology a megaphone an information weapon that's his argument I have a Time: 24:10 - 24:20 couple issues with the argument and its logical underpinning but again this is about what Elon mus says and as his motivations for buying Twitter and Time: 24:20 - 24:30 number three the government is censoring Twitter and Twitter is letting them Twitter was simply um an arm of the government you know it's a state Time: 24:30 - 24:40 publication is the way to think of old Twitter it's a state publication all right this is our list we're going to get to each of these and like try to understand them all but like is anyone Time: 24:40 - 24:50 else wondering what happened here it feels like the story went from quirky Visionary engineer uses his brilliant unorthodox socially immature tactics and obsessions to accomplish unprecedented Time: 24:50 - 25:00 engineering Feats to said quirky engineer suddenly dedicates His Brilliant mind away from physics and towards social media Because he believes Time: 25:00 - 25:10 that there's a deep state conspiracy between San Francisco technologists infected with liberal bias and they're censoring government overlords and he is going to fix Time: 25:10 - 25:20 it what happened I actually never got to the bottom of that and um I I don't think anyone has that's actually been a Time: 25:20 - 25:30 central question that was never answered for me during this reporting we do know this pivot happened sometime in 2020 why did musk shift to obsessing over this the answer to that probably lies Time: 25:30 - 25:40 somewhere in Elon musk's brain and it is not ethical or useful for me to try to opine on his mental health or what is going on in his brain so let's stick to the facts here is The Logical framework Time: 25:40 - 25:50 that Elon Musk used to buy Twitter this is what he wants to do with it is fix this let's see what happens next Time: 25:50 - 26:00 so after firing most of the employees and changing the name to his favorite letter he gets to work on free speech he lets big accounts that were previously Time: 26:00 - 26:10 banned back onto the platform including former president Donald Trump comedian Kathy Griffin lawmaker marjerie Taylor green Jordan Peterson within a few months he posts this tweet around the Time: 26:10 - 26:20 Super Bowl and he notices that this tweet gets less engagement than the Tweet by President Joe Biden Elon does not like this he calls an urgent meeting Time: 26:20 - 26:30 and tasks 80 Engineers to quickly rebuild a version of the algorithm that will allow his tweets to be artificially boosted by a factor of a thousand I was Time: 26:30 - 26:40 kind of skeptical on how Sensational it was reported but through my conversations confirmed that this actually went down like the old Twitter was not built to artificially boost One Time: 26:40 - 26:50 account and Elon the Free Speech guy was like I need you to boost my account because it's not getting as much attention as the president and the ad0 engineers did so a few months after Time: 26:50 - 27:00 buying the company Elon now has super algorithmic power and he uses it to start to amplify certain people so I know what you're thinking Johnny you Time: 27:00 - 27:10 just disagree with these people and so you think that it's bad that Elon let them on but really free speech is about letting everyone talk yes absolutely that is true and yet Elon uses an Time: 27:10 - 27:20 artificially Amplified voice to prop up a very specific type of voice on Twitter to amplify ideas extreme ideas harmful ideas not Time: 27:20 - 27:30 just to liberals in San Francisco but ideas that we as Humanity recognize are bad ideas and now someone with a massive Time: 27:30 - 27:40 megaphone has control on how big those ideas can get even Bill Maher the Elon Fanboy there's a very few people who actually make change happen you are one Time: 27:40 - 27:50 of those people even he could not understand why Elon was doing this I understand why you wanted to like have a platform where you have Free Speech but Time: 27:50 - 28:00 like why then embrace the worst people on it and then Elon isn't totally consistent about this like in the case of Alex Jones who spreads horrendous Time: 28:00 - 28:10 conspiracies and misinformation to a lot of people when asked why Elon didn't let him go back onto Twitter he said no saying that he had no mercy for anyone Time: 28:10 - 28:20 who would use the death of children for gain politics or fame he did eventually reinstate Alex Jones after running a poll but you start to see that he'll reinstate anyone unless he personally Time: 28:20 - 28:30 takes issue with their views or what they said what's puzzling to me is that this isn't free speech absolutism it's not say anything you want musk's new Time: 28:30 - 28:40 Twitter then starts Banning and suppressing substack link substack the place where independent journalists write musk made the change where you can't comment or like on anything that Time: 28:40 - 28:50 has a substack article and you can't embed Tweets in your substack article that doesn't feel like Free Speech To Me musk that decides that the word cisgender is a slur on Twitter and Time: 28:50 - 29:00 threatens to ban people who use it too much is that free speech he then starts Banning journalists who criticize him Time: 29:00 - 29:10 though he did reinstate a few of them after a vote and then starts suing media Watchdog organizations like the center for countering digital hate trying to silence them for criticizing the new Time: 29:10 - 29:20 Twitter musk of course lost with the verdict coming out saying that this lawsuit was basically about trying to Sil criticism and deter others from Time: 29:20 - 29:30 criticizing his company he's someone who is willing to use his enormous wealth and power to silence people like this is such clear anti-free speech behavior Time: 29:30 - 29:40 when Twitter users organized a protest against making users pay for a blue check mark he banned that account and this is what's so mind-bending like I Time: 29:40 - 29:50 swear he's trolling us here he says that he's obsessed with Free Speech but then immediately after taking it over Twitter he demonstrates an extreme hypocrisy for Time: 29:50 - 30:00 that very point and I secretly think he's doing that so that we are talking about it right now I don't think it was ever about free speech I also think that when he posts political propaganda ads Time: 30:00 - 30:10 like this conspiracy video that says that Democrats are letting immigrants in to turn America into single party Rule and has almost 100 million views I think Time: 30:10 - 30:20 he's doing that not because he agrees with this factless piece of propaganda but because he loves to rile people up Time: 30:20 - 30:30 though maybe he does agree with it I don't know either way he has built a platform that gives him the biggest megaphone and suppresses people that criticize him that is not free speech Time: 30:30 - 30:40 okay but let's move on CU Free Speech was just one of his three major motives what about this argument that Twitter is infected with liberal ideology because Time: 30:40 - 30:50 it is based in San Francisco luckily we have data this was a great study very thorough algor rmic amplification of Politics on Twitter it's a study from Time: 30:50 - 31:00 before Elon took over they conducted a long-running massive scale randomized experiment where they looked at a huge number of tweets from seven countries Time: 31:00 - 31:10 and they found that in six out of the seven countries including the United States that quote the mainstream political right enjoys a higher Time: 31:10 - 31:20 algorithmic amplification than the mainstream political left they saw this over and over oh and also a really interesting side note here is that they Time: 31:20 - 31:30 found that Twitter actually doesn't amplify farle or far right political groups more than moderate ones which is a myth that I believed until I read this Time: 31:30 - 31:40 study but the whole point is that old Twitter did not have a liberal bias if anything it had a conservative bias this study is very robust proof of that despite elon's theory that Twitter being Time: 31:40 - 31:50 in San Francisco infected it with a liberal bias go to the sources and read the study for yourself if you want to poke into it if there's anything wrong with it that I'm missing please tell me but it seems like pretty damn solid Time: 31:50 - 32:00 proof to me okay but what about the last critique and this is a big one musk believed that Twitter was being censored by governments and Twitter was letting Time: 32:00 - 32:10 them do this and guess what that is actually true upon taking over Twitter musk cracked into all of the internal Communications and found a bunch of Time: 32:10 - 32:20 emails that showed how Twitter had banned and suppressed information that it deemed harmful and dangerous but that they did so sometimes with a political Time: 32:20 - 32:30 bias you can see things like Biden's team asking Twitter to review these tweets that they didn't like yes governments around the world can ask Twitter to take things down in their country that they think are breaking the Time: 32:30 - 32:40 law or that are harmful to National Security and this happened on both sides the Trump White House asked Twitter to take things down as well but this reporting did reveal what looked like a Time: 32:40 - 32:50 lot of left-leaning bias in censoring certain highly sensitive content that would be damaging to the left the the the big example of this was this New York Post article about Hunter Biden's Time: 32:50 - 33:00 laptop Twitter severely censored this not even letting people DM the link to each other and making up a thin justification for it later now content Time: 33:00 - 33:10 moderation deciding what is harmful and what should be censored and what shouldn't is a really difficult task but for a lot of people including myself this crossed a line this was not okay Time: 33:10 - 33:20 though I have to say that Hunter Biden New York Post article was the most sort of egregious one a lot of the other stuff in the Twitter files was not nearly as black and white much more Time: 33:20 - 33:30 nuanced much more complicated the point is there should be transparency here and I agree with musk on that okay but this is once again where we find some strange Time: 33:30 - 33:40 Paradox that doesn't make any sense which is that since musk took over government censorship on Twitter has gone up Twitter suspended multiple journalists from prominent Outlets Time: 33:40 - 33:50 including the Washington Post the New York Times and CNN tonight a number of high-profile journalists have been silenced here are the number of takedown requests that governments around the Time: 33:50 - 34:00 world made to Twitter in the 6 months before musk took over and these are the ones that Twitter complied with Twitter would fully comply with the government's censorship request about half of the Time: 34:00 - 34:10 time the other half the time they'd say no in the 6 months after musk the number of requests went up probably because musk got rid of a lot of the automatic Time: 34:10 - 34:20 moderation but look musk's Twitter now says yes to government censorship over 80% of the time time way more than the old Twitter wait what and look the kind Time: 34:20 - 34:30 of stuff that musk is allowing to be censored on the platform is really sensitive stuff for free speech like take turkey for example there was a Time: 34:30 - 34:40 Turkish election last year the president of Turkey himself a massive user of State censorship pressured Twitter to block the accounts of a few people he Time: 34:40 - 34:50 didn't like a Kurdish businessman an investigative journalists both of them vocal critics of the president like this is like clear black and white political censorship in an election year like make Time: 34:50 - 35:00 the guy who is criticizing me go away and guess what musk's Twitter did it they said yes they banned the accounts Time: 35:00 - 35:10 and then said we didn't have a choice they were going to shut down all of Twitter so we had to do it and then they patted themselves on the back about how they were still trying to fight it and they're doing so much for battling Time: 35:10 - 35:20 government censorship and transparency on the platform but guess what they did have a choice this same kind of thing happened before musk ever came in and Twitter fought back in a previous Time: 35:20 - 35:30 Turkish election the Government tried to do the same thing censor posts about corruption within the Turkish government they asked Twitter to take these down and Twitter said no they fired back that Time: 35:30 - 35:40 political speech is among the most important speech especially when it concerns matters of possible corruption so turkey shut down Twitter it was down Time: 35:40 - 35:50 for a couple of weeks while they battled it out in court and the Turkish government lost indeed they lost lost because they were trying to censor political speech and Twitter fought back Time: 35:50 - 36:00 there's even more recent examples like Wikipedia or wkipedia as Elon calls it refusing to comply with the Turkish government censorship requests getting Time: 36:00 - 36:10 completely shut down for almost 3 years only to have it be overturned in Turkish courts a major win for free speech in Time: 36:10 - 36:20 Turkey which is something that's in short supply lately so like Wikipedia Twitter can do this they can say no to the Turkish government if they're actually Crusaders for free speech and Time: 36:20 - 36:30 if they're actually against government censorship they would have said no in 20123 musk's Twitter did this in India too when the Indian government asked Time: 36:30 - 36:40 Twitter to censor a bunch of journalists including an entire BBC Bureau and a documentary that was critical of the government and the president and Twitter complied Elon where is your conviction Time: 36:40 - 36:50 for free speech where is your hate for government censorship in moments like this where it really really matters but for Elon Musk he's got a lot of other Time: 36:50 - 37:00 things he needs to think about he needs to think about the market for Teslas who might be buying his satellites or Rockets he needs to be thinking about where Tesla factories might be set up Time: 37:00 - 37:10 the market for his electric cars this is a conflict of interests that gets in the way of his idealistic vision for free speech and his hate for government Time: 37:10 - 37:20 censorship Twitter used to have a page where they would publish in detail why they would take down any content they took down at the request of the government and there's this research lab Time: 37:20 - 37:30 at Harvard that would aggregate all of this for the public when our story producer Alex went to go look for these government requests from turkey and India she found that they no longer were Time: 37:30 - 37:40 there this page had gone quiet so she reached out to the Harvard lab and got this response Twitter stopped sharing Time: 37:40 - 37:50 this data starting in April 2023 no more transparency on government censorship it looks like it's down to the whims of one super rich dude that is not free speech Time: 37:50 - 38:00 that is the antithesis of what this guy said he was going to build so no I don't think Elon Musk is earnest about these Time: 38:00 - 38:10 three things that he said were his motive for buying Twitter in fact after looking into all of this I'm having a hard time figuring out what Elon is earnest about at all other than his Time: 38:10 - 38:20 belief that humans have the potential to do amazing things I do believe that in of this that is the one thing that has stayed consistent but how he's pursuing Time: 38:20 - 38:30 that goal and that Vision in recent years is baffling confusing and in my mind quite harmful to our society Time: 38:30 - 38:40 Twitter seems much more like a platform where he can bully the people he doesn't like he can feed his addiction to crisis Time: 38:40 - 38:50 and controversy while also showing a childish hypocrisy in his principles and values but unlike his other Ventures Time: 38:50 - 39:00 which you can tell when they're successful because they're physics the rocket either goes up into space or it doesn't the car drives or it doesn't this new Venture doesn't have a physical Time: 39:00 - 39:10 feedback loop that tells him if it's doing good or working instead he's playing with the delicate precarious nature of information in the internet Time: 39:10 - 39:20 age something that is already in crisis and now is being chipped away at by one rich dude who gets off on crisis and what blows my mind most is that in the Time: 39:20 - 39:30 process of all of this musk is undermining his own dream his own Vision this is a sentiment I heard from the employees and colleagues of Elon Musk Time: 39:30 - 39:40 they felt betrayed like this man pushed them to think differently to do things that seemed impossible all in the name Time: 39:40 - 39:50 of this Grand Vision of what Humanity could be what we could do as a civilization and yet in recent years he seems to be sabot aging that very Vision alienating the people and customers that Time: 39:50 - 40:00 he needs to bring this Vision to life in my mind Elon has exchanged that vision for controversy and division that forces Time: 40:00 - 40:10 all of us to talk about it here we are talking about it talking about him I think a part of him loves that or needs that and yet after all of this Defenders Time: 40:10 - 40:20 of Elon will continue to argue that only someone like this could be the one to change the world to anyone I've offended Time: 40:20 - 40:30 I just want to say I reinvented electric cars and I'm sending people to Mars in a rocketship did you think I was also going to be a chill normal [Music] [Applause] Time: 40:30 - 40:40 dude and yeah I get that the people who change the world aren't normal and Orthodox they're not nice but I don't accept this way of thinking about musk today maybe a couple years ago but in Time: 40:40 - 40:50 recent years musk has shown it's his addiction to crisis and attention that is having a corrosive effect on our Society validating and glorifying ways of acting that rewards the worst parts Time: 40:50 - 41:00 of us and instead of saving civilization driving us further apart Time: 41:00 - 41:10 [Music] Time: 41:10 - 41:20 hey everyone thanks for watching this deep dive on Elon Musk um I want to tell you about our new channel called search party it is a deep dive into geopolitics Time: 41:30 -

      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:10 because it kind of means coming in and forcibly punching out a government from power. No elections, no process, just power being seized, Time: 00:10 - 00:20 just someone being pushed out and someone being put in. Coups happen in so many different ways, but I wanna show you how the coup has been used by the United States of America Time: 00:20 - 00:30 as a tool to get what they want on the world stage. So let me walk you through some of the major US-led coups over the years to show you that, while it sometimes seems like we live in a world full of order and rules, Time: 00:30 - 00:40 the reality is that the most powerful countries will often get their way by whatever means necessary. Time: 00:40 - 00:50 Okay, so here's how I'm defining the US-led coups that I'm gonna put on our list here. Number one, they were successful. There's a lot of failed coup attempts. Time: 00:50 - 01:00 We're leaving those out. Number two, there must be at least one US government official involved in the coup. And number three, we need concrete evidence that the US was actually involved, not just speculation. Time: 01:00 - 01:10 While the US has been involved in tons of regime change efforts around the world, we landed on a much shorter list. These are the coups that I think best exemplify how this tool has been used Time: 01:10 - 01:20 for international power over the years. Let's start here, Time: 01:20 - 01:30 (distorted, cheesy Hawaiian music) in the independent country of Hawaii. it's 1893 and the US is feeling like the Hawaiian queen is a threat to American control over sugar. Time: 01:30 - 01:40 It's sugar that's being grown by the descendants of white American missionaries who had settled in Hawaii over the years. So the US sends a military ship with hundreds of troops Time: 01:40 - 01:50 to show up to Honolulu, and they overthrow the queen, installing one of those descendants of the Christian missionaries Sanford B. Dole as the new president. Notice his last name? Time: 01:50 - 02:00 Yeah, this coup was one of the US's first, and it set the stage not only for the new Hawaiian president's family to grow their powerful international corporation, which was based in Hawaii, Time: 02:00 - 02:10 but also for Hawaii to be annexed, to become a part of the United States. I made a whole video on this coup because it's pretty wild and there's so much going on here. And it was really a turning point in showing how the US could remove leaders from power Time: 02:10 - 02:20 in far away places, something that they start to do a lot more of. We're gonna move on to the next coup, but I need to thank today's sponsor who makes these videos possible. Time: 02:20 - 02:30 Thank you Nord VPN for sponsoring today's video. I've started using Nord VPN for a lot of different things. When I'm traveling, I connect to the internet via the United States Time: 02:30 - 02:40 so that all of my accounts don't freak out thinking that I'm someone from another country logging into my accounts. Oh, and by the way, that allows me to like watch Netflix from different countries as well, which is kind of cool, Time: 02:40 - 02:50 but it's more than that. It is a password manager, it is a malware blocker. It blocks annoying ads, it helps you encrypt files. It provides all these layers of extra security, Time: 02:50 - 03:00 which more and more is something that we all need. And the best part is you don't have to be a technical person to do this. It's one click away and you have all of this protection, Time: 03:00 - 03:10 or you can have it just connect automatically and you just have it running in the background. And not just for one computer. When you sign up for Nord, you can get up to six devices that are all protected Time: 03:10 - 03:20 by Nord's many different layers of security. And at the end of the day, you don't have to take my word for it. You can go try it out, and if it's not useful to you, you get all your money back. For 30 days, so it's like a trial period. Time: 03:20 - 03:30 Oh, and Nord VPN just turned 11 years old, and so if you click the link in my description, for a limited time, you will get a free mystery gift. Not totally sure what it is, Time: 03:30 - 03:40 but who doesn't like a free mystery gift? Thank you Nord VPN for sponsoring today's video. Let's get back into the map. I gotta get outta here because things are about to heat up. We got a lot more to cover on these coups. Time: 03:40 - 03:50 The next coup has to do with Spain. Well, actually more like Spain's colonies. (percussive ambient music) Spain's glory days have come and gone. Time: 03:50 - 04:00 They are a declining empire and there is major resistance in their colonies, especially in Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines. Meanwhile, the US is a rising empire and they already are pretty uncomfortable with Time: 04:00 - 04:10 Spain having colonies like a hundred miles off their coast. But at the same time, they don't love the idea of true independence for places like Cuba or Puerto Rico. Time: 04:10 - 04:20 These are strategic islands right in the US's neighborhood. And like Hawaii, American companies have money invested, particularly in Cuba. Independence might mean them getting kicked out. Time: 04:20 - 04:30 So the US delves into this fight between Spain and their colonies. They use the explosion of an American Navy ship as their excuse, even though it was likely an accident, not an attack. Time: 04:30 - 04:40 But sometimes stories matter more than truth. So the US sends in troops to liberate the rebels fighting against their Spanish colonizers, promising them independence, Time: 04:40 - 04:50 not only in Cuba and Puerto Rico, but later, over here in the Philippines and Guam. These local uprisings eventually drive out the Spanish, and in all of these cases, the US reneges on their promise Time: 04:50 - 05:00 to give independence to these locals. And they figure out ways to govern Cuba and Puerto Rico indirectly themselves. The US has just piggybacked off several independence movements Time: 05:00 - 05:10 to enact several coups at once, allowing them to install pro-American leaders and a Navy base in Cuba, and eventually annexing Puerto Rico and Guam, which they still control, Time: 05:10 - 05:20 and the Philippines, which they held for 48 years. Again, I made a whole video about this one too if you wanna go deeper. Anyway, we gotta move a little quicker here because we're not gonna get through all these coups. Time: 05:20 - 05:30 Let's move on. Okay, so we're over here in Nicaragua, it's 1909. (bright, quaint piano music) There's a bunch of powerful American companies here, but a new president comes to power, vowing to regulate them. Time: 05:30 - 05:40 The US is not gonna let this happen. So the Secretary of State starts spreading rumors to smear this guy, this president, saying that he's building a canal that would compete with the Panama Canal. Time: 05:40 - 05:50 But really they're just upset because Nicaragua was taking loans from Europe. The US keeps painting this guy as a war criminal and someone worthy of being thrown out. Time: 05:50 - 06:00 So, push comes to shove and the US sends ships to both of Nicaragua's coasts. They assemble a bunch of Marines in Panama, basically just flexing on Nicaragua Time: 06:00 - 06:10 and telling the president to step down. And the benefit of being a rising superpower is that it worked, he has no choice but to step down. And soon a leader that the US likes comes to power. Time: 06:10 - 06:20 The coup is complete. And really, this is the first of many instances of the US meddling in Nicaragua. A few years later, the US is back in the region for another coup in next door Honduras. Time: 06:20 - 06:30 This one was plotted by a band of private American citizens and it follows a similar pattern. A new president comes to town, in this case directly inspired by Nicaragua's president, and he wants to take back control of the country Time: 06:30 - 06:40 from American businesses. In this case we're talking about bananas. The banana companies were not gonna let this happen. And it was mostly this guy, a banana businessman named Sam the Banana Man. Time: 06:40 - 06:50 He's not gonna let this pesky president run his country, no. So he assembles his own militia, he literally buys a surplus Navy ship, loads it up with weapons, Time: 06:50 - 07:00 and starts his campaign to get this president out. He sails from New Orleans to the coast of Honduras and he literally invades the country with, like, a private army. Wait, what? Where's the US government in all this? Time: 07:00 - 07:10 They also didn't like the political direction of Honduras either. So they just sort of stood back, let this private invasion happen. And then at the critical moment, Time: 07:10 - 07:20 the US steps in to order a ceasefire, basically bullying the president to step down. He had no way forward, no defense, so he resigns. (urgent synth music) Time: 07:20 - 07:30 And the Banana Man's leader of choice takes the presidency, giving the banana businessman land and a unique status to import anything he needs tax free and, wait for it, he refunds him Time: 07:30 - 07:40 for all of the coup expenses using public Honduran money. This Banana Man literally overthrew the government and made Honduras pay for it. Wow. Time: 07:40 - 07:50 Okay, so let's move forward to the '50s where the coup becomes a more useful tool in the American toolkit. Time: 07:50 - 08:00 There's this new US agency dedicated to collecting and analyzing information from all over the world, meaning for spying. They call it the Central Intelligence Agency, the CIA. Time: 08:00 - 08:10 And it completely revolutionizes the art of the coup. Oh, and at this point, the US is now a full-blown global superpower. No longer just looking in their own neighborhood, but rather at the whole world map, Time: 08:10 - 08:20 investing huge resources into fighting their global rival and its communist ideology. So this gets us to Iran 1953, where Iran had just elected Time: 08:20 - 08:30 a new star politician, Mohammed Mosaddegh. He rises the power believing that Iran must take back control of its most valuable natural resource, oil, Time: 08:30 - 08:40 which at the time was completely controlled by a British company called the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. We know it today as BP . Mosaddegh is done with this. \"Let's kick the British out and take back our oil.\" Time: 08:40 - 08:50 But like the US, Britain is not happy with Iranians trying to take back their resources. So they warn that if they do this, there will be consequences. Time: 08:50 - 09:00 So the British catch a quick meeting with the CIA's Middle East guy, who was passing through London, and they pitch him on this idea. \"Let's throw out Mosaddegh.\" The CIA's like, \"Okay.\" Time: 09:00 - 09:10 And they kind of sniff communist vibes on Mosaddegh with this big desire to nationalize Iran's oil. Or at least they tell themselves they do. So the CIA agrees, and they secretly send this guy to Iran. Time: 09:10 - 09:20 He's the Middle East Bureau chief, Kermit Roosevelt, he's like in his thirties. Oh, and yes, he is the grandson of another big coup guy, Teddy Roosevelt, Time: 09:20 - 09:30 who I have gone into in other videos. Roosevelt sneaks into Iran and is given a million taxpayer dollars to use, quote, \"in any way that would bring about the fall of Mosaddegh.\" Time: 09:30 - 09:40 So now there's American CIA agents in Iran secretly trying to overthrow the government. And it's a rocky start at first, with a bunch of failures. But they start using their money to get traction, Time: 09:40 - 09:50 bribing politicians, religious clerics, and other leaders to say divisive and controversial things about Mosaddegh. They hire locals to stage attacks against religious leaders, Time: 09:50 - 10:00 making it look like they had been ordered to do so by Mosaddegh, but really, they were getting paid by the CIA to do this. And with enough time and money, they create an atmosphere of chaos and hostility and distrust among the public. Time: 10:00 - 10:10 Oh, and there's weapons. The CIA stashes enough weapons and explosives to support a, quote, \"10,000 man guerilla organization for six months.\" Time: 10:10 - 10:20 Like, just in case they need to start a full-on conflict. The result of all of this is more violence and chaos that engulfs the capitol. Shops are being destroyed, bullets are flying into mosques, Time: 10:20 - 10:30 people are beaten, and thousands of paid demonstrators flood the street. The city falls into anarchy, all of it orchestrated by CIA money. And in the end, this all results in Time: 10:30 - 10:40 a bloody shootout at Mosaddegh's house. He eventually gives up and turns himself in. He's put through a sham trial and found guilty of treason and sentenced to three years in solitary confinement Time: 10:40 - 10:50 and then house arrest, where he stayed until his death. The previous ruler of Iran, Mohammed Reza Shah, which just means \"King,\" had fled the country. Time: 10:50 - 11:00 But now, with the democratically elected Mosaddegh gone and with the backing of the US and UK, he could charter a flight back into Iran and take control. - [TV Reporter] The Shah crowns himself Time: 11:00 - 11:10 in a tradition which goes back 25 centuries. His title is King of Kings, and he becomes emperor of his nation. (suspenseful string music) - [Narrator] The US really came out on top here. Time: 11:10 - 11:20 They got what they wanted. They now have an American-friendly dictator in a powerful country in the Middle East who is now welcoming American oil companies to get in on one of the largest oil reserves on Earth. Time: 11:20 - 11:30 Under the Shaw, Iran becomes a brutal police state. He executed military officers, student leaders, anyone associated with Mosaddegh. He set up a secret police force, and life was brutal. Time: 11:30 - 11:40 So brutal that in 1979, the frustration of Iranians burst forth in mass protests that ran the Shaw out of office and replaced him with an inspiring new leader Time: 11:40 - 11:50 who would turn Iran into an Islamic Republic built in part off a foundation of resentment for the US having meddled in their country. The Islamic Republic has held power ever since, Time: 11:50 - 12:00 and has morphed into the oppressive theocracy we know today, though maybe not for long. Before we go on, a quick reminder that all of these coups, Time: 12:00 - 12:10 these plans to overthrow leaders in other countries, did not require American votes or consensus or approval of Congress. It was usually just a few key men Time: 12:10 - 12:20 in government buildings in Washington DC making this happen. These people would go on to define the Cold War and shape so many covert operations around the world, Time: 12:20 - 12:30 many of which we'll never know about. Okay, let's keep going. (urgent drum music) The next year in Guatemala, the CIA tried to pull the same playbook that they used in Iran, once again targeting a leader that the people had elected, Time: 12:30 - 12:40 but who wanted to take back the country's resources for the people, to break up these American monopolies that controlled the country's electricity and railroad. Time: 12:40 - 12:50 The president even starts to seize land from one massive banana company. It was often unused land that he wanted to redistribute to the locals who could farm it and feed their families and hopefully climb out of Time: 12:50 - 13:00 the system of endemic poverty in the country. Once again, I made a whole video on this, the geopolitics of bananas in Central America. But the fact is that the US decided that they had to defend the banana companies Time: 13:00 - 13:10 or else more communist reforms would spread. So the US president and secretary of state ordered an overthrow, and the CIA got right to work. Time: 13:10 - 13:20 The CIA hand selects a leader that they want to be in power and then they start giving equipment and training to a bunch of Guatemalan exiles and private soldiers. They set up a secret operation base Time: 13:20 - 13:30 on the outskirts of Miami. They start delivering weapons to the Panama Canal. But like the other coups, it can't just all be about weapons. They gotta own the information space. Time: 13:30 - 13:40 So they create a radio station that sounds like it's a local Guatemala radio station, but really it's being operated out of a small town in Florida. And they start publishing fake news Time: 13:40 - 13:50 about an uprising, unrest, a rebellion. And then at the same time, the fighters that the CIA had trained and armed invades Guatemala. Pilots start dropping bombs Time: 13:50 - 14:00 on fuel tanks and military posts and airports. But they weren't starting a full-on war. They weren't trying to cause real damage. They wanted it to feel like a domestic uprising, like a war was on the horizon, Time: 14:00 - 14:10 to freak people out, and for many it totally worked. They thought that this was a real uprising and had no idea that the CIA was behind it all. But the president knew what was up. Time: 14:10 - 14:20 He had messed with the USA and now he's hearing about it. Military leaders in his circle are feeling the pressure from the big bully from the north and they turn on him and he eventually surrenders. Time: 14:20 - 14:30 On his way out, the president addresses his people, makes it very clear that, quote, \"The United Fruit Company, in collaboration with the United States, is responsible for what is happening to us.\" Time: 14:30 - 14:40 And just like that, one president is out and the handpicked CIA option is in. This new regime is brutal and goes on to do horrible things, Time: 14:40 - 14:50 detaining people they thought were communists, killing prisoners, breaking up labor unions, and in the process restoring the banana company's land and ensuring that they maintained their hold on this economy. Time: 14:50 - 15:00 This kicks off an era in Guatemala of more political assassinations and instability, something that still plagues the country today. And yet to this day, there is no evidence that Time: 15:00 - 15:10 the Soviets were ever slightly interested in Guatemala. Communism was once again the excuse, but really this was about securing American business interests, tearing a country apart for bananas. Time: 15:10 - 15:20 ♪ Bananas taste the best and are the best for you ♪ All right, let's go to Africa. So, it's 1960 here in the center of Africa, Time: 15:20 - 15:30 a country called Congo. They just gained independence from Belgium, and they have an election, and this guy Patrice Lumumbau wins, becomes the prime minister. But immediately, over in Washington, Time: 15:30 - 15:40 the communist alarm bells instantly start sounding off, because we're in the middle of the Cold War and Congo is a place full of tons of natural resources, including loads of uranium, Time: 15:40 - 15:50 the main ingredient for nuclear bombs. This is at a time when Americans are keeping gas masks next to their bed and have hordes of canned goods in their basements. And officials in Washington can't risk Time: 15:50 - 16:00 Congo falling into the influence of the Soviet Union. So they start focusing on this prime minister. The CIA director called him, quote, \"An urgent and prime objective\" that should Time: 16:00 - 16:10 quote, \"be a high priority of our covert action.\" So they pull a more political coup than the ones before. They start allying with Lumumbau's political enemies and Congo's former colonizer, Belgium. Time: 16:10 - 16:20 They bribe politicians, they fund protests and labor movements, and they circulate propaganda, similar ingredients to the previous coups. And when the moment is right, all these bribed politicians do what the CIA asked them to. Time: 16:20 - 16:30 They'd remove Lumumba from power, and the CIA is right there giving money and intelligence and advice to the new government. Time: 16:30 - 16:40 This political solution was actually not the first try. The CIA had tried to assassinate Lumumbau in the past, but all of those attempts failed, which is why they turned to hijacking and manipulating Congolese politics, Time: 16:40 - 16:50 a brand new democracy, supporting the people who would eventually go on to put Lumumba in front of a Congolese and Belgian firing squad, making this effectively a political assassination Time: 16:50 - 17:00 supported from an ocean away. And yet there's so much gray area in these coups. In this case, it's really tough to prove that the CIA's support was the key factor in Lumumbau's assassination. Time: 17:00 - 17:10 It's debated to this day. An effective foreign-sponsored coup works like this, operating in the shadows, fueling divisions, Time: 17:10 - 17:20 appealing to the worst demons of the people on the ground through money, through influence. Time: 17:20 - 17:30 All right, let's move on to the Caribbean in the 1960s. (urgent synth music) There's a brutal dictator here in the Dominican Republic. I mean, this guy's really bad. He's rumored to feed his opponents to sharks. Time: 17:30 - 17:40 But anyway, what the US cares about is that there's fear that a communist revolution could happen at any moment. So the CIA sends weapons to a group of of hitmen who go assassinate this guy. Time: 17:40 - 17:50 It ends up being an ambush and a car chase. They're successful in taking him out, ending his 31- year rule. And eventually the US sends in forces to occupy the DR, Time: 17:50 - 18:00 to make sure that a leftist candidate doesn't come to power. They restore order, and eventually a US-friendly candidate is elected. Time: 18:00 - 18:10 Okay, so now we have to head over to Vietnam in 1963. (suspenseful string music) And boy, this is a way bigger one than we have time for, but we're trying to focus on the coup element of this. Time: 18:10 - 18:20 Vietnam was divided in two, between communist and pro-Western governments. The US needs the South to stay on their side, but Washington starts to lose confidence in this guy, Time: 18:20 - 18:30 the South's leader, he's losing a grip on the country, and the US fears that communism will take over the whole country of Vietnam. So the CIA rolls up its sleeves, it's time for another coup. Time: 18:30 - 18:40 This time they focus on a South Vietnamese general who also doesn't love the president, and he agrees to do the CIA's bidding. And when given the signal, the general directs his military to seize the airport and radio stations, Time: 18:40 - 18:50 and they block off highways. They march to the presidential palace, a bloody shootout goes down, and this president, President Diem, escapes. Time: 18:50 - 19:00 He happens to be with his brother, but it's not going well for them, so he realizes that he needs to set up a meeting to surrender. They're gonna meet at a Catholic church. This was probably gonna be a peaceful meeting, but when the generals arrive, Time: 19:00 - 19:10 they just kill him on the spot, saying, quote, \"To kill the weed, you must pull up the roots.\" Meaning in order to solve the problem, Diem must die. Time: 19:10 - 19:20 Exile was not enough. Now the US actually didn't plan for this to happen. They didn't want to kill this guy. It was not an official order from Washington. But they made this coup happen. Time: 19:20 - 19:30 JFK is said to be really distraught about this. The first American Catholic president behind the coup that killed the first Vietnamese Catholic president. And incidentally, JFK was assassinated 20 days later. Time: 19:30 - 19:40 And one national security journalist argues that Diem's assassination actually had a greater impact on American history than the murder of JFK Time: 19:40 - 19:50 because it locked the US into a decade of conflict in Vietnam, which ballooned into a long war ending in an embarrassing defeat and a political crisis at home. Time: 19:50 - 20:00 One of the few coups where the US actually had to deal with the aftermath. Okay, let's blast through a few of these really quickly. Time: 20:00 - 20:10 I'm gonna skirt over some details here. It's 1964, and Brazil is potentially veering off into communism, with the rise of a new leftist leader. Lucky for the CIA, there's already a coup being plotted against him. Time: 20:10 - 20:20 So the US military just shows up with ships off the coast of Brazil. They airlift in a bunch of ammunition and supplies. They didn't end up having to do much, actually. Instead, they just stood by with reinforcements Time: 20:20 - 20:30 and watched the Brazilian coup go down. The leftist leader goes down and a new leader comes in. In 1973, there's a coup in Chile that is a very complicated story with conflicting accounts Time: 20:30 - 20:40 and we went down a super deep rabbit hole and we've decided that because the evidence is not rock solid, we're going to cut it for time, but definitely some crazy shit went down, Time: 20:40 - 20:50 I'm not saying it didn't. (urgent jazz drum music) Okay, we're back in Africa and it's the eighties. And over here in Libya, the dictator Muammar Gaddafi Time: 20:50 - 21:00 was making lots of trouble in the region, funding terrorist groups and working to expand his influence all over the region. Then he gets a call from his neighbor Chad asking for help against a rebellion. Time: 21:00 - 21:10 Gaddafi eagerly sends 4,000 troops to occupy a huge part of the country and makes friends with the new president by helping him exile his rival. Time: 21:10 - 21:20 And soon Gaddafi is getting greedy and threatening to merge Chad into Libya. The US is not into this. So Ronald Reagan fires up the well-oiled coup machine, launching a covert war, Time: 21:20 - 21:30 sending weapons and cash to rebels in Chad, and supporting that political opponent who was ousted, helping him fight back, and it works. The president of Chad has to flee and the US backed and supported leader comes to power Time: 21:30 - 21:40 and now there's a conflict, and the CIA continues arming the war even after this guy is in office. The new US-backed leader rules brutally for eight years Time: 21:40 - 21:50 until he's eventually overthrown by a military officer. And in 2013, he was charged with crimes against humanity, torture and war crimes. Time: 21:50 - 22:00 Okay, now let's go to this little island in 1983. (percussive jazz music) It's communism again, and the US sends 2,000 troops to invade this small remote island Time: 22:00 - 22:10 and remove their communist leader. They didn't really know much about this small island, and they literally had to use tourism maps to plan their invasion. Anyway. Time: 22:10 - 22:20 American forces move in, overwhelm the Grenadian fighters who happen to be joined by their Cuban allies, the government collapses and the US-friendly leader comes to power. Time: 22:20 - 22:30 Okay, back down to Central America. It's 1989 and we're here in Panama where the US has control of a very important canal. And luckily the Panamanian dictator has been Time: 22:30 - 22:40 very friendly to American interests. But the US starts losing confidence in this guy, wondering if he's really the best choice, ensuring the US maintain easy access to their vital canal. Time: 22:40 - 22:50 Oh, and it didn't help that this guy was indicted in Florida on drug trafficking and money laundering charges. We gotta get him out. But the straw that broke the camel's back for this guy was Time: 22:50 - 23:00 when Panamanian troops killed an unarmed American soldier in Panama City. The US is done with this guy, so they invade Panama with 27,000 troops. Time: 23:00 - 23:10 Panama's military is crushed and the dictator is eventually arrested and sentenced to 40 years in prison, and the US ensures access to its canal after all. Time: 23:10 - 23:20 Okay, so now it's the end of the 1980s and the Soviets are invading Afghanistan (urgent string music) Time: 23:20 - 23:30 and are meeting resistance from a bunch of fighters from all over the world who have come to Afghanistan to fight back against the Soviet occupation, many of them with fundamentalist religious motivations. Time: 23:30 - 23:40 But the US doesn't care about their motivation. They just care that that they're willing to fight against the Soviets and the Soviets' puppet, the Afghan president. And it totally works. Time: 23:40 - 23:50 With the help of the US, these fighters push the Soviets back and successfully run the Afghan president out of office. And as he's being run out of office, he forebodingly warns the Americans that Time: 23:50 - 24:00 if they leave Afghanistan in the hands of these fighters, that it would, quote, \"Be turned into a center for terrorism.\" And his prophecy was completely fulfilled. Time: 24:00 - 24:10 Those US-funded fighters were people whose names we know today: Osama bin Laden, Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi, the guy who started the group that would eventually become ISIS. Time: 24:10 - 24:20 Those same weapons that the US sent to counter the Soviets and to effect regime change in Afghanistan would go on to be used against American soldiers years later Time: 24:20 - 24:30 when the US was back orchestrating yet another regime change after 9/11 against the very groups they once enabled. The US would eventually leave Afghanistan, only to find Time: 24:30 - 24:40 the country immediately falling back into Taliban rule. We're almost to the end of our list and we're now in modern day, it's 2003, and 150,000 American troops invade Iraq. Time: 24:40 - 24:50 They say that they are there to find and destroy weapons of mass destruction, but their main focus is taking out this guy, Saddam Hussein, Time: 24:50 - 25:00 which they do in a matter of weeks. Saddam fleeing into hiding and President Bush declaring \"mission accomplished,\" establishing an American-friendly government in Iraq, creating once again a negative byproduct Time: 25:00 - 25:10 by alienating huge swaths of the Iraqi people and army who form a bunch of anti-American rebel groups that go on to fight against the American occupation, Time: 25:10 - 25:20 some morphing into groups like ISIS who wreak all kinds of havoc on the region to this day. Once again, I made a whole video about this topic. Go check it out. Iraq remains a place of deep political instability. Time: 25:20 - 25:30 Trust in government is extremely low. And the question of how and why we did this expensive, horrific, destructive coup Time: 25:30 - 25:40 is still something that there aren't really good answers to. Again, you can go watch my video for more on that. (pensive piano music) And this gets us to the final coup on our list. Time: 25:40 - 25:50 It's 2011, during a wave of protests spreading throughout this region, trying to take down all these strongmen dictators, one of which was this guy Muammar Gaddafi. The same Gaddafi we were talking about earlier Time: 25:50 - 26:00 who was like taking over Chad? He's still here and he's still a very horrible dude. And there's worry that he's gonna potentially massacre all of these pro-democracy protestors. Time: 26:00 - 26:10 So the US feels like it must get involved to save these protestors. They rally their NATO allies to help them, but at some point the mission switches to total regime change. Time: 26:10 - 26:20 We don't know exactly how this happened, only the people in the room do. But is it surprising? We've seen this long arc of the US using the coup as a force for getting their way Time: 26:20 - 26:30 in an international conflict. It's a tried and true tool in the American foreign policy toolkit. So it's not surprising that a coup becomes a solution Time: 26:30 - 26:40 during these difficult decision-making processes. So anyway, the target becomes Gaddafi, and now NATO drones are firing missiles at his convoy and he eventually gets captured and gets killed on the spot. Time: 26:40 - 26:50 Libya has been in chaos ever since, but it's not like it was a great place under Gaddafi. And once again, we're in a gray area where we don't know the history that didn't happen Time: 26:50 - 27:00 or how things could have turned out different if the US didn't get involved. That debate lives on. Okay, so that's our list. These are our coups Time: 27:00 - 27:10 that we decided to go over in this video. And there are so many more that we could have mentioned. My purpose in doing this broad back-to-back history of American led coups was so that we can see patterns that emerge. Time: 27:10 - 27:20 How a rising superpower became really good at removing leaders that didn't align with their way of seeing the world or, in a lot of cases, who were not friendly to American business interests. Time: 27:20 - 27:30 But let's be clear, the US didn't invent this. This is something that powerful countries and empires have always done. What characterizes US-led coups, Time: 27:30 - 27:40 especially during the Cold War, was how the overthrow of these governments often stamped out new democracies, budding democratic movements, replacing them with authoritarian leaders Time: 27:40 - 27:50 who would go on to oppress the people with the support and backing of the United States, and in the process, redirecting the country's history. Lately, Russia has been meddling in Time: 27:50 - 28:00 the election process of the United States, and I've been reflecting on my feelings towards that. The violation of having an external power sowing doubt and polarization and fear Time: 28:00 - 28:10 in my own democracy, in my own society. It feels like such a violation, and it is. This is giving me just a tiny taste of what it feels like Time: 28:10 - 28:20 to have an outside power pulling this strings in your country, tearing it apart for their own purposes, and in the process, creating more problems for the people Time: 28:20 - 28:30 and for the United States itself, undermining any semblance of democracy or development, all in the name of keeping the US on top Time: 28:30 - 28:40 and dominant over the globe. (wistful ambient music) Time: 28:40 - 28:50 You didn't mention that during Qaddafi's rule, education, electricity, medical insurance, and gas were free. One of the reasons for his removal was his attempt to establish an African Union that would have a currency backed by gold reserves instead of the petrodollar.",

00:30 [Music] but wait yes this is russia but russia is also this and this Time: 00:30 - 00:40 and this this one country encompasses over a hundred languages spread across 11 time zones i mean the Time: 00:40 - 00:50 place is freaking huge countries aren't really supposed to be this big so how did this happen how did russia become so damn big Time: 00:50 - 01:00 [Music] countries come in all shapes and sizes Time: 01:00 - 01:10 you have really small countries like here in europe the country of monaco is tiny it's literally two square kilometers like smaller than most cities now that's obviously an outlier Time: 01:10 - 01:20 so let's look at a more average-sized country like belgium more like 11 000 square kilometers then you have even bigger countries like france like 550 Time: 01:20 - 01:30 000 square kilometers over here in the united states where everything is apparently bigger you have states that are bigger than Time: 01:30 - 01:40 france like the state of texas is 695 000 square kilometers all 48 of these continental united states are huge by european standards at least Time: 01:40 - 01:50 this whole continental united states is 8 million square kilometers so you have all these different sizes of countries the average sort of looks like this and then you have the second largest Time: 01:50 - 02:00 country on earth which is canada huge but now take a look at the size of the largest country on earth russia Time: 02:00 - 02:10 is huge it is more than double the size of the continental united states 17 million square kilometers makes up Time: 02:10 - 02:20 one-eighth of the total habitable area on earth and it's almost double the next biggest country on this list i mean it's mind-blowing Time: 02:20 - 02:30 russia is a part of europe it also shares a beach line with turkey but then you go all the way over here and it has an extensive border with china and north korea [Music] Time: 02:30 - 02:40 keep going and it stretches all the way up here to where you could literally swim from russia to the united states assuming you can swim Time: 02:40 - 02:50 you know like two and a half miles so yeah russia is [ __ ] huge it's giant but not that long ago russia wasn't huge in fact relative to empires and Time: 02:50 - 03:00 their borders russia was kind of a small fish that's the story i want to tell you a thousand years ago russia looked like Time: 03:00 - 03:10 this a loose group of slavic peoples who were a growing and prosperous society here in eastern europe but they had a pretty big weakness and that weakness looked Time: 03:10 - 03:20 like this these are flat grasslands which are very easy to cross if you're an army looking to pillage land and that's exactly what a Time: 03:20 - 03:30 group of horse-riding warriors did these guys were the mongols and they basically used this path of flat grasslands to traverse across Time: 03:30 - 03:40 asia and expand their empire 40 000 of these mongol guys on horses with bows and arrows eventually made it all the way here to the slavic peoples of russia here's Time: 03:40 - 03:50 an image of them invading the cities and burning them down conquering these people look at how scared these people look i mean i would be too if Time: 03:50 - 04:00 40 000 mongols on horseback rode into my city anyway so the mongols take over this Time: 04:00 - 04:10 little block of slavic people and it really weakens their society it breaks up all the cities that were sort of collaborating with each other and now they're paying taxes to the mongols like this Time: 04:10 - 04:20 empire that was from super far away like on the other side of the world but there was one city in this area that was particularly ready to fight back they Time: 04:20 - 04:30 were quietly getting more powerful this city was called muscovy or moscow eventually and it became the regional epicenter for trading fur which is a thing that was Time: 04:30 - 04:40 becoming all the rage in europe moscow was also learning how to use gunpowder and guns and technology from europe and before long they were able to punch Time: 04:40 - 04:50 back against the mongols whose big ass empire was getting really big and hard to maintain and it was sort of starting to crack Time: 04:50 - 05:00 and moscow was there to take advantage of this i mean let's be honest there's only so long you can keep an empire that looks like this together way Time: 05:00 - 05:10 too big i mean this is the biggest land empire in history but it didn't last long even though they had these badass warriors on horseback anyway so yeah moscow started punching back Time: 05:10 - 05:20 they had fur money and they had gunpowder and they were having success pushing the mongols out and moving east Time: 05:20 - 05:30 one thing's for sure said moscow which was soon becoming the russian empire we're not gonna let anyone sneak up on us again like the mongols did and everyone over here sort of Time: 05:30 - 05:40 chuckled and european and said don't you realize that the only way to keep people out is to have like mountains and water to protect you and the russians were like oh yeah you mean like these and the Time: 05:40 - 05:50 europeans were like nice so moscow which was just a city but is now becoming the russian empire starts expanding towards these mountains Time: 05:50 - 06:00 and soon they have like a nice empire-sized set of borders some mountains for protection they have an economy of fur they have technology Time: 06:00 - 06:10 and commerce they're getting rich things are looking good for russia but wait a minute can we overlay that green layer on the map that shows the super Time: 06:10 - 06:20 highway of grasslands that the mongols used to invade yeah that one that one ugh look there's a flaw in the plan nice try russia but you see that this natural border Time: 06:20 - 06:30 which is great has a huge gap of flat grasslands that people can easily pass directly on their way to moscow Time: 06:30 - 06:40 so it's the middle of the 1500s moscow has beat back the mongols is expanding east they're doing their fur thing they find kind of a natural border but it doesn't really work Time: 06:40 - 06:50 so they're still looking for a natural border or water or something to buffer their country to the east and then this terrible guy comes into power his name was literally ivan the terrible Time: 06:50 - 07:00 and he had some pretty big ambitions for expanding russia he's like dude we don't need to stop at these mountains let's see how far we can push this thing Time: 07:00 - 07:10 east way past the mountains what he finds on the other side of these mountains is a very sparsely populated land of ice called siberia there wasn't a lot of people here and Time: 07:10 - 07:20 the people that were there weren't super resistant to this russian takeover the main thing that the russians had to fight against was the cold but with cold comes furry Time: 07:20 - 07:30 animals who have thick coats of fur which again was incredibly valuable in european markets and that helped fuel this race to just keep going Time: 07:30 - 07:40 east [Music] Time: 07:40 - 07:50 is it just me or they sort of overcompensating like yeah we get it you got invaded by the mongols and like you Time: 07:50 - 08:00 want to like make sure it doesn't happen again but like settle down they just kept moving east until eventually they reach the pacific ocean the edge of the world Time: 08:00 - 08:10 but they didn't stop there they just kept going i mean listen this is so far away from the original starting point of moscow Time: 08:10 - 08:20 and it started to get to the point where the government back in moscow was sort of sending out expeditions not really sure what they were doing and what they were taking over because they Time: 08:20 - 08:30 couldn't really like stay in touch with them they were just sort of hoping for the best after one russian dude went out on an expedition and conquered some remote city in the far east Time: 08:30 - 08:40 a government official back in moscow said nobody really knows why he did that and to what end there is however something erotic taking Time: 08:40 - 08:50 place in the borders of our empire erotic i guess that's one way to talk about it but here's the most interesting part to Time: 08:50 - 09:00 me about this russian imperialism that is very different than most imperialism that i've looked into when the russians would find a tribe or a people or culture that was very different than Time: 09:00 - 09:10 theirs because they were so far from home they first tried to negotiate with them and convince them to join the russian empire if people resisted it got very predictable Time: 09:10 - 09:20 imperialism very quickly but a lot of tribes didn't resist and they found it beneficial to be a part of this growing empire so this empire grew without a lot of Time: 09:20 - 09:30 conflict and in the process enveloping a lot of cultures that sort of kept their identity their language their culture far far away from moscow because of this russia today Time: 09:30 - 09:40 is yes this huge landmass but perhaps a better way to look at it is this Time: 09:40 - 09:50 [Music] russia today is divided into 85 Time: 09:50 - 10:00 territories 22 of these territories are actually called republics they have their own official language their own legislature Time: 10:00 - 10:10 and basically are totally independent from russia except for in international affairs it's like 22 countries within a country all with their own Time: 10:10 - 10:20 unique style so yeah while russia is this there's also other versions of russia and i want to show you some of those Time: 10:20 - 10:30 stop one let's look at the republic of sakha it's located way in the east and it's Time: 10:30 - 10:40 huge 3.1 million square kilometers massive this place is in a time zone six hours ahead of moscow the people here don't look like putin at Time: 10:40 - 10:50 all their ancestors are not from the original moscow russia area and they speak their own northern siberian turkic language as well the capital of Time: 10:50 - 11:00 this russian republic is way up here it's called yakutsk it's the coldest large city on earth with an average temperature of minus eight degrees Time: 11:00 - 11:10 centigrade and this whole region is full of these giant holes in these holes they're looking for diamonds 25 of the world's diamonds are mined in this republic so yeah this is russia Time: 11:10 - 11:20 next stop down here is dagestan which borders the countries of azerbaijan and georgia the climate here is so Time: 11:20 - 11:30 different than what i think of when i think of russia it is hot and dry and people here speak 13 different official languages besides russian plus Time: 11:30 - 11:40 there's a bunch of unofficial languages and 83 of the people here identify as muslim which again like i don't think of muslims in russia Time: 11:40 - 11:50 but this is russia it's right next to chechnya which is another part of russia which is politically and culturally very much doing its own thing the people here declared independence in the 90s Time: 11:50 - 12:00 which caused rebel groups to militarize and then there was war and terrorist attacks and people died and putin may or may not have planned a Time: 12:00 - 12:10 bombing to frame chechnya and terrorists to then go to war with them so he'd get approval rating so he could take over the country Time: 12:10 - 12:20 no no wait no i'm not going down the freaking rabbit hole i'm doing one of those fun geography videos where we talk about cultural diversity and and like borders and history and not this stuff come on Time: 12:20 - 12:30 just this once can i just go into a video without having to talk about the fact that some people are really terrible anyway so dagestan down here has all these Time: 12:30 - 12:40 different languages and people so different than what i think about when i think of russia plus i mean look at this fashion culture okay so there's a republic here right on these Time: 12:40 - 12:50 mountains these mountains that we talked about that were sort of a good natural border but had a big hole in them the ural mountains this is the comey republic the main thing about this republic is it doesn't look like the sort of ice Time: 12:50 - 13:00 swept moscow streets that i'm used to of russia this place is known for its natural beauty beautiful landscapes and where Time: 13:00 - 13:10 the gulags were the brutal russian prisons during the soviet times where they would do terrible things anyway there's these beautiful rock formations that are super unique Time: 13:10 - 13:20 and people aren't supposed to climb on them because there's some legend and it's bad luck but of course foreigners show up and do stupid things and they couldn't resist and here they are anyway this is russia okay Time: 13:20 - 13:30 a couple more you have this republic of kamikia you just need to look at this place and its people to know that this feels very different than what you think of as Time: 13:30 - 13:40 russia and yet this is russia mother russia has been sort of brutal to these people over the years trying to erase their culture but Time: 13:40 - 13:50 even still they persist last one i want to talk about is called tuva it's down here here's putin visiting tuva a while back this is another place where russian ethnicity and language Time: 13:50 - 14:00 is a minority the people here are more related to the mongols and they speak a turkic language called tuvan which sounds like this Time: 14:00 - 14:10 so is the upshot here is that this is russia but so is this and this and this and Time: 14:10 - 14:20 this russia got really big as they were searching for a border and for fur and they just kept expanding their empire enveloping all of the people and Time: 14:20 - 14:30 cultures that came with it [Music] okay let me just be clear about something russia is giant this video is not 15 hours long Time: 14:30 - 14:40 and so i was able to give a very brief overview of the history the history is so much more mind- bendingly complicated it's like game of thrones on Time: 14:40 - 14:50 steroids not to mention today's russia is also so much more diverse like a mosaic of cultures and languages that i was able to give a little overview for but i know that a lot of Time: 14:50 - 15:00 you watching are thinking why isn't he mentioning fill in the blank i want to hear from you like what are the parts of russia that you know about that i didn't mention here that are the most interesting or the Time: 15:00 - 15:10 most surprising that are more different from the russia that we sort of think of let me know in the comments i got i got fascinated with russia as we did the navalny video a while back Time: 15:10 - 15:20 and i'm now becoming deeper and deeper into this place and where it came from and what it looks like today i've never visited and i want to so Time: 15:20 - 15:30 maybe i can't though because i did that navalny video and they'll be angry at me if i go there anyway i hadn't thought about that Time: 15:30 - 15:40 [Music] okay before you go i want to tell you how you can sign up for skillshare for Time: 15:40 - 15:50 free and start learning stuff skillshare is this giant repository of tutorials video based quality tutorials that can teach you anything from Time: 15:50 -

00:20 [Music] then this is a rocket yes a full-blown rocket that is headed for space Oh and I know this kind of looks small it's not Time: 00:20 - 00:30 small and where is this rocket being launched from are there underwater bases yes they're called Time: 00:30 - 00:40 submarines once it gets to the surface it flies 1,000 km above Earth literally Time: 00:40 - 00:50 into space it starts looking at the stars to navigate and eventually falls back down to Earth traveling up to like 12,000 km to hit whatever target the Time: 00:50 - 01:00 people who launched it wanted it to like what have we created with such destructive power it threatened the Time: 01:00 - 01:10 world a deadly game of stealth an undeniable strategic deterrent nuclear warheads that can wipe out countries submarines are cool I just got Time: 01:10 - 01:20 to say it they're these massive floating nuclear weapons that could be anywhere at any time that we use for psychological warfare and and actual Time: 01:20 - 01:30 Warfare and spying on people and because of this these giant vessels are actually incredibly stealthy like you could be swimming in the ocean one day minding your own business and right below you Time: 01:30 - 01:40 there could literally be this massive 48,000 ton metal machine with a couple hundred humans aboard equipped with nuclear warheads that could be launched at a moment's notice and you would have Time: 01:40 - 01:50 no idea because not being seen is kind of their wholeo which is nuts because these are some big boys like Russia's typhoon class submarine if you just that Time: 01:50 - 02:00 out of the water and put it on land somewhere you start to get a scale for how massive this thing is like a floating building yeah these guys are thick and they're cruising around our oceans 250 M below the surface oh and Time: 02:00 - 02:10 something we're going to talk about later they literally have nuclear power plants on board giving them basically unlimited energy to make fresh water and oxygen which means they could be down Time: 02:10 - 02:20 here in the depths of the ocean for decades that is if there weren't humans aboard that needed to come up to eat food navies around the world who have Time: 02:20 - 02:30 submarines do everything in their power to ensure that these Subs are quiet and invisible even magnet resistant all in the name of being undetectable and Time: 02:30 - 02:40 they're always out there right now in this very moment there are tons of these things there are humans on these multistory buildings that are floating around our oceans with giant weapons in them this is not normal how did we get Time: 02:40 - 02:50 here why were these things invented there's a lot to understand about submarines there's a lot of angles we have been researching for months and today we are going to show you how we Time: 02:50 - 03:00 got here what submarines can do and most importantly why one submarine has enough nuclear weapons to essentially end life Time: 03:00 - 03:10 on the planet as we know it's just one submarine an increase in submarine activity Russian rearming their Fleet Chinese submarines Iranian submarines they will preserve peace for many years Time: 03:10 - 03:20 to [Applause] come boy today's topic is so juicy and there is so much to get through um Nick Time: 03:20 - 03:30 our studio manager is building something for today's topic I want to show you but actually first I want to thank the people who made this possible so thank Time: 03:30 - 03:40 you better help I've become a massive proponent of therapy I wasn't my whole life it's only a couple years now that I've been in therapy and it has truly changed my life I I am not saying that Time: 03:40 - 03:50 because better help is sponsoring today's video I'm not saying that as an exaggeration I'm saying that truly literally therapy is a life-changing thing regardless of if you have a Time: 03:50 - 04:00 clinical mental health issue like depression or anxiety or like me you don't have something clinical but you're just a human who lives in this world and has relationships and fears and stresses Time: 04:00 - 04:10 therapy can truly give you tools to approach your life in a very different way the big problem here is that finding a therapist can be really difficult it's Time: 04:10 - 04:20 often a matter of calling and going to waiting rooms and talking to insurance better help changes the game on this they're an online platform where you can go on on answer a few questions and then Time: 04:20 - 04:30 based on your preferences better help matches you with someone in their massive network of over 25,000 therapists oh and if you don't want to talk face Toof face with your therapist Time: 04:30 - 04:40 via like a video call you can do text or a chat or a phone call you get to make that decision based on what you need and what your preferences are if the therapist isn't a good fit for you you Time: 04:40 - 04:50 can easily change and it doesn't cost you anything I think a lot of people don't get therapy because it's incredibly arduous and there's a lot of friction in finding a therapist and SCH Julene better help solves this and makes Time: 04:50 - 05:00 therapy more accessible and affordable and again I'm a giant proponent of that there's a link in my description it's betterhelp.com Johny Harris clicking that link helps support this channel but Time: 05:00 - 05:10 it also gets you 10% off your first month of betterhelp so you can try it out at a discount and see if it's a good fit for you thank you better help for supporting this video um let's go check in on Nick he's building something super Time: 05:10 - 05:20 cool okay Nick Nick Nick Nick what are you up to oh yeah it's coming together look at this model oh my God yeah it's the ssbn and Jackson Lafayette class as Time: 05:20 - 05:30 you can see all the pieces are out everywhere and these are the people look at the people oh my God you look up here in the front these are the bunks these Time: 05:30 - 05:40 are the Torpedoes okay we will check in with Nick in a moment as that model gets built let me tell you how we got here people have been building boats to Time: 05:40 - 05:50 try to go underwater for a very long time like look at this old art where you can see Alexander the Great going completely underwater in a big glass Barrel this is like 2,000 years ago 1,00 Time: 05:50 - 06:00 years later you have Leonardo da Vinci who was busy literally thinking of anything that could be invented and he sketched up his very own version of an underwater boat this beauty right here Time: 06:00 - 06:10 it was basically like a big mechanical fish oh and this is wild he kept these sketches a secret because he feared quote the evil nature of men who practice assassination at the bottom of Time: 06:10 - 06:20 the sea like he thought that we might use these underwater boats for war whoop anyway the first known boat to Time: 06:20 - 06:30 actually navigate underwater was of course built by a Dutch dude the Dutch man they're just so good at Water 150 years later over here in what was soon Time: 06:30 - 06:40 to be the United States George Washington paid for this sucker to be made for his army I mean there going to be a whole video about this boat the turtle cuz it kind of looked like two Time: 06:40 - 06:50 turtle shells put together so cute the guy in there is just like so cozy they tried to use the turtle in their War for Freedom against the British but it never really did anything useful and and it just sank I mean cool name but wasn't a Time: 06:50 - 07:00 super useful submarine but it paved the way 50 years later we have the American Civil War where the Confederate Rebels built a sub that was powered by a bunch Time: 07:00 - 07:10 of guys manually turning a crank and on board it had a long Spar torpedo don't be fooled though Spar torpedo was just a fancy way of saying a bomb on a 15t stick and they actually used it they Time: 07:10 - 07:20 snuck up on a Yankee ship underneath it with their bomb stick in the middle of the Civil War and blew it up and both sides sank like the submarine sank too Time: 07:20 - 07:30 like it didn't work I mean it kind of worked but it didn't really work anyway I had to mention all of these like early submarines because they kind of laid the groundwork but in the 1800s things get Time: 07:30 - 07:40 really serious thanks to this guy over here in Germany Rudolph diesel invented an engine that changed everything this new engine mixed pressure and air and fossil fuels that all exploded and made Time: 07:40 - 07:50 things move this changed a lot of Industries but the Germans were like let's put these in submarines and run them to charge a bunch of batteries that we can use used to power the sub while Time: 07:50 - 08:00 we're underwater it's a lot better than the hand crank and indeed it was but there was one big problem which is that this engine needs air like it needs to be able to pump out the exhaust that it makes and it needs to be able to suck in Time: 08:00 - 08:10 air to like make energy so you can't actually run your engines underwater so these German Subs as stealthy as they were were still very limited because they could only stay under water for Time: 08:10 - 08:20 like 48 hours max before having to come up and give away their position so that they could get air for their engines this is a problem that will soon be solved but we just need a few Wars Time: 08:20 - 08:30 [Music] first it's the 1900s we have all these big Empires that are looking for ways to destroy themselves with their new industrial technology and they're getting good at submarines they're Time: 08:30 - 08:40 loading them up with more and more batteries now they have sonar and radar capabilities so that they can like see underwater and they have radios and encryption devices so they can talk to Time: 08:40 - 08:50 each other while they're underwater which is everything when you're fighting a war the Germans call these submarines unter boats or U boats and they use them for their new plan of unrestricted Time: 08:50 - 09:00 submarine warfare which is a sterile way of just saying we feel comfortable sneaking up on civilian boats and sinking them and killing the people without notice because we've decided we are literal villains submarines aim and Time: 09:00 - 09:10 fire their deadly torpedo always over them in the threat of sudden attacks in the face of anime submarines so yeah being used for horrible means but let's Time: 09:10 - 09:20 be clear this is amazing technology like this is light years ahead of the forefathers of submarines like the turtle or that poorly thought out bomb on a stick thing from the Civil War but Time: 09:20 - 09:30 they still have the limitation of air they need to come up all the time to get air for their engines no matter how scary and stealthy they could become and sneaking around underwater during these Time: 09:30 - 09:40 wars they still have to come up to the surface every 48 hours to run their engines and recharge their batteries giving away their sneaky position and becoming way less effective as a war tool this would be like playing Time: 09:40 - 09:50 Battleship but every few turns you have to flip your board around to show your opponent where you are for a sec they kind of figured this out a little bit when they started to use these two little tubes that allowed them to kind Time: 09:50 - 10:00 of still be underwater but to like put the tubes up and suck down air from the surface push out exhaust but it's kind of rubbish like having to run your noisy engines every 48 Hours was a huge Time: 10:00 - 10:10 limitation on how useful these Subs could be well of course the war ends Germany loses and surrenders and some of these Time: 10:10 - 10:20 OTS that were just sitting there were divvied up among the winners the US the UK and the USSR who discovered that wow the Germans have some amazing submarine Tech let's use this Tech to pimp out our Time: 10:20 - 10:30 own Subs leap frogging Decades of development and this is where things get juicy and [Music] Time: 10:30 - 10:40 scary so now you have these two former allies the US and the Soviet Union looking at each other with skepticism they both got their hands on this German Tech and they both know that the other Time: 10:40 - 10:50 got their hands on this German Tech and they both secretly are like we need to get way better than the other at submarine tech let's go this was a huge priority but it was also weird and Hush Time: 10:50 - 11:00 Hush Cold War this begins an era of secretive investment into submarine technology and this is where they level up to blow all of our minds where submarines become the impossibly Time: 11:00 - 11:10 advanced machines that we know [Music] today something that changed everything here was that humans had learned to Tinker with atoms breaking them apart to Time: 11:10 - 11:20 make incredible amounts of energy and they use that energy to blow things up but also to make electricity and crucially nuclear energy didn't require Time: 11:20 - 11:30 air so it's the 1950s and you got this guy he's a Russian born American Navy guy named hman rickover and he was like whoa whoa wait a second you're telling Time: 11:30 - 11:40 me that you can make electricity but you don't need air light bulbs going off on this guy's head because he's a submarine guy and he's like let's slap these puppies into submarines that would solve all of our needing to come up to the Time: 11:40 - 11:50 surface every couple of hours problem the US government's like wait sorry what did you say Rick over and Rick over is like I said let's put the nuclear power plant inside of of the submarine we got Time: 11:50 - 12:00 to get ahead of the Soviets he got a lot of push back for this for obvious reasons but he dug his heels in leap frogging all the bosses till he got to the chief of Navy operations and whispered in his ear his big idea and it Time: 12:00 - 12:10 totally worked the story of how this went down is insane and Rick over was insane and Visionary and I'll leave some reading in the sources for those who want to go down that rabbit hole join a lot of discipline here just Time: 12:10 - 12:20 like breezing over this guy's story but yes it's the 50s and the US government set about trying to put a full-blown nuclear reactor a power plant in inside of their Giant floating weapon and they Time: 12:20 - 12:30 did somehow and it changed everything the arrival of nuclear power has broken those bonds going go around the world on a core of uranium only slightly larger than a golf ball she may have just as Time: 12:30 - 12:40 profound an effect on AAL strategy as the airplane is head on war let's see how Nick's doing with his Time: 12:40 - 12:50 model oh here we go look at this big boy here she is wow [Music] Time: 12:50 - 13:00 wow I am going to put this model on my Time: 13:00 - 13:10 desk and look at it every day because it's beautiful and it's like retro which is kind of cool anyway uh let's get back to the story here because the next Time: 13:10 - 13:20 chapter here is really the chapter that matters most once they got the nuclear reactor onto these Subs everything changed I'm going to show you why Time: 13:20 - 13:30 so look at this big old submarine it's the sturgeon class submarine from the' 60s to US Navy sub and look back here we've got the nuclear reactor it sits Time: 13:30 - 13:40 back here doing its thing breaking atoms apart which produces an enormous amount of heat that can heat up water that turns this massive propeller and remember that spinning things gives you Time: 13:40 - 13:50 power electricity boom you're spinning turbines and now you have electricity for your submarine not only does the nuclear reactor not need air to work but Time: 13:50 - 14:00 it literally creates air after all it's surrounded by H2O so all it needs to do is break the two h's from the O and boom you've got oxygen for your crew to Time: 14:00 - 14:10 breathe I mean this nuclear reactor was magic move over trees we've got submarines and they use all of this abundant energy to get rid of salt in the water so now the crew has like Time: 14:10 - 14:20 drinking water and can take showers while they're floating hundreds of meters under the ocean like this is becoming really insane the nuclear reactor solved all the problems remember Time: 14:20 - 14:30 how diesel submarines had to refuel all the time and they had to come up to the surface to run their engines and get rid of their exhaust and suck in the air nuclear submarines could now run underwater without needing to refuel for Time: 14:30 - 14:40 20 years oh that is if you don't count having to refuel the humans on board so rickover was right nuclear reactors on submarines changed everything they are Time: 14:40 - 14:50 now way more useful you can now sneak around the ocean and never give away your position okay so now that we can be underwater for basically ever let's load these suckers up with big Time: 14:50 - 15:00 [Applause] weapons these suckers are getting huge by like the 70s and ' 80s I mean here Time: 15:00 - 15:10 was the German uboat remember the one like the thing that like really like pushed it all forward and here is an American Cold War era submarine the Ohio class this thing is massive like zoom in Time: 15:10 - 15:20 here those are people here's their kitchen here's the reactor back here doing all of its magic and and look here's where the crew sleeps oh and what Time: 15:20 - 15:30 are they sleeping next to what are all these tubes doing here oh these tubes kind of right where the crew is sleeping yeah these tubes are what make the Time: 15:30 - 15:40 submarine maybe the most important weapon to have ever existed this is where the nukes [Music] are well technically we don't know that Time: 15:40 - 15:50 this is where the nukes are and any Submariner will vehemently tell you that quote we cannot confirm or deny whether or not the missiles inside of these silos carry nuclear weapons wink wink Time: 15:50 - 16:00 this is where the nukes are so what started as two superpowers nerding out about German submarine Tech in the' 40s turned into an arms race that resulted Time: 16:00 - 16:10 in both of them figuring out how to power their subs with nuclear reactors and the ability to load up these Subs with 24 rockets that they could launch to the edge of space at any moment Time: 16:10 - 16:20 carrying multiple nuclear warheads like having nuclear weapons on land ready to fire is pretty cool having them on planes is pretty powerful but you can see both of those things when you have a Time: 16:20 - 16:30 sub quietly roving around the world's oceans with the ability to carry a bunch of nuclear weapons and to launch them any point you've just achieved the most powerful advantage in military strategy Time: 16:30 - 16:40 surprise the panopticon your enemy has no idea where you are but they know you are somewhere in range at all times so they have to act as if you are everywhere a few button presses away Time: 16:40 - 16:50 from launching one of these things but this psychological sort of mind game only works if you are never noticed so the next next phase of this technological evolution of submarines Time: 16:50 - 17:00 focuses on silence they start coating their submarines with rubber tiles so that the Sonar doesn't bounce off as well they took these giant propellers Time: 17:00 - 17:10 that yes are massive bigger than you can imagine and made them impossibly quiet and even on the inside they started taking crazy precautions like all the heavy gear in a submarine is mounted on Time: 17:10 - 17:20 rubber pads to dampen any vibration that could be detected or heard the cooks even started putting rubber on everything like their mixing bowls and their mixing spatulas are all like sound Time: 17:20 - 17:30 deadening materials so that they don't send out vibration and make noise the submarine force is serious about silence in fact they take pride in calling themselves the silent service and there Time: 17:30 - 17:40 kind of a chip on their shoulder because they don't get nearly as much recognition as like these guys do they're just like lurking in the depths of the ocean doing like a really Time: 17:40 - 17:50 important defense thing and no one knows about them because literally that's their job is to never be noticed wow so you have the US and the Soviet Union both with the ability to Time: 17:50 - 18:00 launch nukes from their submarines and ironically this whole everyone pointing a gun at each other thing actually keeps these great powers from ever fighting a Time: 18:00 - 18:10 war with each other they were both too afraid of how easy it would be for the other to strike back with their stealthy Subs ensuring the destruction of both sides this is deterrence and it is one of the major forces keeping great powers Time: 18:10 - 18:20 from going to war with each other that's why the US has an entire fleet of Subs with no other Mission than to go into the ocean and just disa appear and just sit there silently ready to make good on Time: 18:20 - 18:30 their threat that if you attack us we are always ready to respond submarines are also really good for Time: 18:30 - 18:40 spying okay so we know by now that a lot of communication in this world is made possible because of underwater cables it's not just the internet these cables have existed for a very long time and Time: 18:40 - 18:50 they're just sitting there at the bottom of the ocean connecting the whole world and they're safe because no one has access to them no one's going to go to the very bottom of the ocean oh wait submarine submarines have unique access Time: 18:50 - 19:00 to these cables so it's the early 1970s and American intelligence agencies team up with the Navy to have them scour the ocean floor looking for Russian Time: 19:00 - 19:10 communication cables with the idea that they could tap into the cables and listen to them and Loan behold they found one 120 M below the surface over in this eastern part of Russia they Time: 19:10 - 19:20 found a cable that connected two Soviet Naval bases and they put a literal tape recorder into the cable and now they are literally listening to Soviets talking to each other about all sorts of Time: 19:20 - 19:30 military things none of it is encrypted in any way because no one expected them to dive down and find this cable oh and they Time: 19:30 - 19:40 were really clever they sort of only Loosely attached it to the cable in case they like needed to pull up the cable for maintenance or something the little device would fall off and no one would Time: 19:40 - 19:50 ever know that they were being spied on but the tapes that were recording like filled up so divers had to go down and retrieve the recording device and take out the tapes and put in new tapes and Time: 19:50 - 20:00 they did that like every month and they were like we will never get caught for this but then eventually they did it turns out that an NSA employee got paid $35,000 from the Soviets to tell them Time: 20:00 - 20:10 about this operation anyway that that would be an amazing movie someone please make that spy movie the fact is that Subs still do a lot of spying they will often have Navy Seals aboard that are Time: 20:10 - 20:20 ready to dive and do dot dot dot redacted we have no idea like we have literally no idea what they do for obvious reason there is evidence that Time: 20:20 - 20:30 the US and UK spy agencies still tap into cables like the undersea fiber optic cables that like govern the internet and that they do this all the time see Edward snowden's big leak and Time: 20:30 - 20:40 some deep dive into that I'm not going to go into it but we know that submarines spy we know that countries are always spying on each other this should not be surprising in fact during the research for this video I felt the Time: 20:40 - 20:50 insatiable desire to dive down the rabbit hole of how submarines spy and I didn't because I'm trying to stay disciplined and I'm trying to tell this Time: 20:50 - 21:00 story but leave a comment if you want me to make that video and I will consider it cuz there is a lot more about that topic let's move [Music] Time: 21:00 - 21:10 on okay so let's get up to speed where are we today with submarines according to the US Navy's website the US has 71 Time: 21:10 - 21:20 submarines 53 of them are fast attack subs and 14 are the ballistic missile Subs that sit there and be our deterrent and four are guided missile Subs but Time: 21:20 - 21:30 then there's other sources that say that there's only 68 submarines I don't know all of this is like classified and we're not supposed to know and no one's supposed to know but we know a lot but not specifics and like I mentioned all Time: 21:30 - 21:40 of these Subs have very different capabilities fast attack subs for example are optimized for closer attacks they use a lot of cruise missiles which are launched through these big tubes and have jet engines and computer brains for Time: 21:40 - 21:50 navigation they're way more precise but they can still go pretty far I mean we're talking like 2400 km away 800 km an like they're still very very effective long-term weapons Russia says Time: 21:50 - 22:00 it launched 26 cruise missiles today 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles have hit a Syrian Air Base launching dozens of Time: 22:00 - 22:10 missiles targeting the Syrian regimes but again the one that like represents the mind-blowing reality of what we humans have invented is this sucker the Ohio class submarine they do have Time: 22:10 - 22:20 Torpedoes and several other sort of smaller scale weapons but it's these tubes that are carrying missiles which are carrying Warheads that are the big defining game Cher of Time: 22:20 - 22:30 this technology so let me just break down the Journey of these Rockets they can hit targets that are upwards of 6,400 KM away that's like wider than the Time: 22:30 - 22:40 entire United States and probably a lot longer but of course the Navy won't tell us these things because it's all classified and they don't just carry like one nuclear warhead they can carry Time: 22:40 - 22:50 multiple and they're not all just going to one place they actually get dropped at different locations how an unbelievable amount of s scientific Ingenuity let me explain it starts at Time: 22:50 - 23:00 the Boost phase where the missile gets its initial ump gets pushed out of the water up into the air goes up into the sky gets a bunch of momentum and then the engines cut and the missile just has momentum and it starts to fly just using Time: 23:00 - 23:10 the laws of physics it's literally at the edge of space we're now in the midcourse phase the missile then just starts casually looking at the stars to Time: 23:10 - 23:20 calibrate its position and then making little micro adjustments to make sure that it is perfectly on course for its Target and this is where we need to talk about Warheads no not not those these little cones that aren't that little are Time: 23:20 - 23:30 Warheads the most powerful weapons humans have ever created these missiles can have up to 12 of these cone-shaped Warheads they're just hanging out on the front tip of this rocket eventually this Time: 23:30 - 23:40 missile reaches its highest point and starts to come down at this phase the missile starts spitting out the WarHeads just at the right time just at the right velocity and as they reenter Earth's Time: 23:40 - 23:50 atmosphere they start hurling towards their targets as far as500 km apart so like roughly the the distance between Iceland and Norway and then when they Time: 23:50 - 24:00 get where they were programmed to go I mean you know what happens oh but that happens potentially Time: 24:00 - 24:10 12 times from this one rocket each one of these explosions being roughly six times more powerful than the bombs dropped on Japan at the end of World War Time: 24:10 - 24:20 II okay so that was one missile this submarine can hold 24 missiles like what have we Time: 24:20 - 24:30 created luckily since World War II no one has had to use nuclear weapons in any conflict we've had a lot of threats lately but luckily they just remain a Time: 24:30 - 24:40 deterrent force and not an actual thing that we use hopefully it stays that way and yes several countries have the ability to load these things onto their Time: 24:40 - 24:50 floating weapons called submarines that are lurking in the depths of the ocean at all times spying and just sitting there okay so that's submarines well no that's Time: 24:50 - 25:00 like a teaspoon of submarines this topic could go on forever I mean seriously I was this was a painful story to do because there was so much I had to leave Time: 25:00 - 25:10 on the table I have a feeling that I'm going to be making a few more videos about submarines soon but let's just remember what we've learned here we humans have invented something pretty wild something that should be impossible Time: 25:10 - 25:20 the ability for a bunch of us to live underwater in these floating buildings for months at a time we load these things up with enough Firepower to turn Time: 25:20 - 25:30 entire countries to dust all in the name of never having to use them that is the Paradox of modern conflict and yet the thing I'm taking away from having spent Time: 25:30 - 25:40 a lot of time thinking about submarines is that humans can kind of do whatever they put their minds to making power out of nuclear fision and putting that into Time: 25:40 - 25:50 an underwater weapon like what shooting Rockets into space having them look at the stars and then land wherever they want to Human did this we did it because of fear and skepticism and conflict we Time: 25:50 - 26:00 did this to get ahead to be more powerful but we did this and that in some weird way gives me hope that Time: 26:00 - 26:10 someday when the best Minds aren't directed to the priorities of power and conflict we humans will continue to make magic happen magic that helps more and more people live better lives making Time: 26:10 - 26:20 impossible things possible [Music] Time: 26:20 - 26:30 thank you for watching my video on submarines what you're not looking at right now is all the props we have that Time: 26:30 - 26:40 were just sort of like in the background blurred out but they're super cool look at this this model of the USS West Virginia you can see the little silos up Time: 26:40 - 26:50 here for the nukes all these guys what I didn't tell you is that my father-in-law is actually the captain of a submarine Time: 26:50 - 27:00 one of the ssbns so I had some major Insider info that uh I've been learning about for literally a decade and uh that helped spur this video on I am getting Time: 27:00 - 27:10 more and more excited about the community we're building over at The Newsroom The Newsroom is what we call our patreon it just sounds way cooler to call The Newsroom we have a community of Time: 27:10 - 27:20 people that we ask for feedback on things for advice on things we have live streams I just did a live stream with the community it was really cool you also get an extra video every month it's a behind the scenes Vlog of how we make Time: 27:20 - 27:30 what we make here in the studio you meet the people the team you see the processes you see the shenanigans it's a good time and you also get the fuzzy feeling that you are supporting Time: 27:30 - 27:40 independent journalism here on YouTube so go check that out patreon.com Johnny Harris we have Luts and presets which help you color your videos and photos we have a lot more videos if you're new Time: 27:40 - 27:50 around here uh subscribe to the channel because we publish a lot lately like as the team has grown we just publish tons of videos now which is fun and kind of Time: 27:50 - 28:00 stressful sometimes and we have that's all we have I've reached the end of what we have to give to you and now I am done Time: 28:00 - 28:10 telling you what I can give to you what can you give to me okay I'm done bye thank you [Music] Time: 28:10 - 28:20 everyone but Time: 28:20 - 28:30In a world of tiktoks and YouTube shorts it's always amazing that Johnny is able to consistently make these 30 minute videos and still hold our attention Amazing editing!!",

      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:10 Up here in the northwest corner of Saudi Arabia. (suspense music) It's quiet up here. Time: 00:10 - 00:20 All you can hear is the wind and the sand that it whips off these endless dunes. (suspense music) Time: 00:20 - 00:30 But not far from where I sleep there's a new sound. (suspense music) Time: 00:30 - 00:40 For years I've been hearing about this trillion dollar futuristic city that the kingdom of Saudi Arabia is building atop this sand. Time: 00:40 - 00:50 (suspense music) They're calling it Neom, and they're investing a huge amount of their vast oil wealth into making it come to life. Time: 00:50 - 01:00 (suspense music) I've been hearing about all the reasons it can't work, how this is all just a mirage of royal ambitions. Time: 01:00 - 01:10 And yet even from space, you can see that they're building it, they're building something. Time: 01:10 - 01:20 (suspense music) Why would anyone try to build a futuristic city in a barren desert? Time: 01:20 - 01:30 That is a question I've had for a very long time, and one I intend to get to the bottom of. So I'm going into Neom to see what it looks like, Time: 01:30 - 01:40 to get a sense of its scale. We're looking at this fleet of dump trucks. The amount of construction activity is insane, Time: 01:40 - 01:50 and it hasn't stopped as we've been driving along The Line. The magnitude I've never seen anything close. They're building mountains out there. Time: 01:50 - 02:00 I'm joined by my friend Solom, who was born in a tent out here. He knows this desert better than anyone, Time: 02:00 - 02:10 every dune, every valley. All the secret water spots hidden deep in red rock slot canyons. Time: 02:10 - 02:20 I asked Solom to bring me out into the desert, not only to get up close on the construction of Neom, Time: 02:20 - 02:30 but also to show me how people live out here, to introduce me to members of his tribe, how they've survived for centuries. Time: 02:30 - 02:40 Nomadic Bedouin, who represent the origin story of this desert kingdom. (Bedouin people laughing) I wanted to put a human face to this collision of worlds, old and new. Time: 02:40 - 02:50 (lively music) I believe this little shape on the map Time: 02:50 - 03:00 represents the story of Saudi Arabia, where it came from, how it got here, and why it is attempting to build these cities in the sand. Time: 03:00 - 03:10 (lively music) Time: 03:10 - 03:20 (truck revving) I am officially in Neom, and let me tell you what I'm seeing so far. Time: 03:20 - 03:30 (trucks revving) Trucks, trucks, trucks, dump trucks, cargo trucks, trucks carrying excavators, trucks, carrying more trucks. Time: 03:30 - 03:40 I've never seen so many trucks in my entire life. Oh, and these roads, a lot of them are brand new, a lot of them don't even show up on Google maps. Like I'm looking at my phone and I'm just sort of floating in no man's land Time: 03:40 - 03:50 because these are all brand new roads. This is new, everything is popping up so quickly. Ha-ha, there's so many trucks. Time: 03:50 - 04:00 (upbeat music) All of the sudden Solom turned off one of these pristinely new roads. Why do you deflate the tires? Time: 04:00 - 04:10 - For the dune. - We're now gonna start driving just... into the desert. (lively music) Wow, this car can go everywhere. (lively music) (car revving) Time: 04:10 - 04:20 Are we going up this dune? - Yeah. - Oh wow. (car revving) Time: 04:20 - 04:30 Whoo. Geez, this is insane. (ambient music) Time: 04:30 - 04:40 (car revving) Time: 04:40 - 04:50 It's gorgeous. Okay, now we're really in the desert. Time: 04:50 - 05:00 (ambient music) (car revving) Time: 05:00 - 05:10 We found a little canyon to camp in. (fire crackling) And while I thought we'd be eating Time: 05:10 - 05:20 granola bars or canned soup, Solom had other plans. - [Solom] Have you tried camel meat before? - [Johnny] Nuh-uh. - [Solom] You will try it tonight. Hashi is the young camel. Time: 05:20 - 05:30 - [Johnny] Ah, rice with camel meat. The evening tradition here is to wind down with a cup of coffee. Time: 05:30 - 05:40 Saudi coffee is unroasted and green, infused with cardamom. It's a different taste, I like it though. But it's still very caffeinated. Time: 05:40 - 05:50 Oh, and then after the coffee comes... - Tea? - Ah, thank you. Which again is very delicious, but how can they drink so much coffee before bed? Yeah, I can't drink too much Time: 05:50 - 06:00 because I- - Oh yeah. - The caffeine, I won't be able to sleep. - Yeah. - In the morning I'll drink a lot of it. - Okay. (ambient music) Time: 06:00 - 06:10 - Wow. Mm-hmm, wow, I love it. So until what age did you live in the desert? Time: 06:10 - 06:20 - Maybe until seven. - Until seven? - Yeah. - Did you like it? - Yeah, I like it. - Yeah. - I like it. (ambient music) It's so rare to find families. Time: 06:20 - 06:30 Real families living in desert. - Yeah. - The people that we are going to, they are real Bedouins. (Bedouins people laughing) Time: 06:30 - 06:40 But when we moved to the city... I study. (cars hooting) I go back- - Oh, you go back to the desert? - Yeah. Time: 06:40 - 06:50 Even for me, I like like to have a job in the city, but I want the Bedoiun life. - Yeah. - I want them to stay. Time: 06:50 - 07:00 - Soon we'll meet the Bedouin nomads who sleep under these stars every night. Look at this night full of incredible stars. Time: 07:00 - 07:10 (ambient music) Wow. (ambient music) Time: 07:10 - 07:20 The Saudi desert is proving to be exceptionally peaceful, despite the army of trucks that, by the way, are still working here in the dead of night. Time: 07:20 - 07:30 I don't ever stop and haven't for years. (suspense music) Time: 07:30 - 07:40 It is so silent here. My brain doesn't know what to do about it. Time: 07:40 - 07:50 It's so silent and... (ambient music) But as the sun rises and Solom feeds me dates and green coffee, Time: 07:50 - 08:00 oh, and of course more tea, I'm thinking about my mission for today. My plan is to drive all throughout Neom, Time: 08:00 - 08:10 to all the big construction sites and show you what they're planning on building out here with their initial budget of $500 billion, which has since ballooned to an estimated $1.5 trillion. Time: 08:10 - 08:20 And you're about to see why. So I made it to the coast, and I'm looking at the beautiful Red Sea, Time: 08:20 - 08:30 which is a very beautiful kind of blue in fact. - [Announcer 1] This is Oxagon, the place where ideas can change the world. Time: 08:30 - 08:40 - [Johnny] Oxagon is planned to be their futuristic industrial city. Half of it built on the water. It'll be a port where shipping can connect the world to a bunch of high tech manufacturing, Time: 08:40 - 08:50 research and logistics. And there's Sindalah, which is gonna be right here on the Red Sea. Time: 08:50 - 09:00 It's going to be a luxury resort island with plenty of parking for yachts. We picked up a hitchhiker who has been working on Sindalah for years. How's it looking in Sindalah? Time: 09:00 - 09:10 - [Hitch Hiker] Finished like 99%. - Really? - Yeah. (upbeat music) Time: 09:10 - 09:20 And then there's Magna, which is actually the name of one of these coastal villages Time: 09:20 - 09:30 we've just been driving next to that is no longer a village. They've forcibly relocated thousands of people for this project. Time: 09:30 - 09:40 (classical music) Atop the ruins of these villages, the kingdom is building 12 luxury coastal resorts and communities. (classical music) Time: 09:40 - 09:50 Hey, just one quick clarification here, all of those visuals are 3D renders. They are visualizations done by Neom Time: 09:50 - 10:00 to see what they want this to look like. This stuff doesn't exist yet, and I think that maybe is obvious, but it looks so real that I just want to just make crystal clear. Time: 10:00 - 10:10 I'm showing a lot of this stuff from the hype-y promo visuals that have come out from Neom. So that's one thing. Also, check out some of this footage I got Time: 10:10 - 10:20 while I was on a dune. It's floating around on this dune. This is me shooting from the drone, but suddenly on the other side of this massive dune, there are these green circles. Time: 10:20 - 10:30 When I was planning my trip to Saudi Arabia, I got really interested in these things, but that has nothing to do with Neom, so I hopped on the phone with my new colleague, Christophe, Time: 10:30 - 10:40 and asked him to go down the deep dive rabbit hole of why there's a bunch of green circles in the Saudi desert. And he did so, and he made an entire video about what he learned. That video is live right now Time: 10:40 - 10:50 on our new channel Tunnel Vision, I think you're gonna like it. And before we get back to the story of Neom, and I show you the Bedouin and show you the rest of this video, which is a total monster of an edit, Time: 10:50 - 11:00 I need to tell you about today's sponsors. Sponsors are how I'm able to do this, how we're able to spend months and months and months constructing such a massive video. Today's sponsor is Rocket Money.

So thank you Rocket Money for sponsoring today's video. There's a lot more to this video Time: 12:30 - 12:40 and this is where it starts to get pretty juicy. So let's dive back into the story of Neom and the Bedouin of Saudi Arabia. (classical music) Time: 12:40 - 12:50 Built on some pretty wild designs, ideas and concepts, including- - [Announcer 2] A vast subterranean digital community Time: 12:50 - 13:00 inside a mountain, Magna, the coast of Mia. (classical music) - [Johnny] Yeah, right there is perfect. Time: 13:00 - 13:10 (classical music) - And then there's Trojena up here in the mountains. Time: 13:10 - 13:20 Yes, there are big mountains here. It's going to be a luxury tourist destination for adventure and wellness retreats, complete with an artificial lake and outdoor activities Time: 13:20 - 13:30 like mountain biking and skiing. Yes, I just said skiing. Up here in the mountains it gets kind of cold in the winter and snow falls. Definitely not enough for skiing, Time: 13:30 - 13:40 but enough for them to make fake snow and make ski slopes. They're building a manmade lake, in fact, they're doing it right now, I'm looking up at the mountain Time: 13:40 - 13:50 and seeing the plumes of smoke from the dynamite that they're using to do whatever they need to do to build an artificial lake. Oh, and by the way, Time: 13:50 - 14:00 that's the mountain where Moses talked to God and got the 10 Commandments like a few thousand years ago. - There is no freedom without the law. (classical music) Time: 14:00 - 14:10 Who is on the Lord's side? - [Announcer 1] Welcome to Trojena, the mountains of Neom. (Johnny laughing) Time: 14:10 - 14:20 - This is all so strange. (classical music) Time: 14:20 - 14:30 And then of course, the one you've maybe heard about. (ambient music) Time: 14:30 - 14:40 And yes, it's being built. Time: 14:40 - 14:50 (ambient music) I've been driving along it all morning Time: 14:50 - 15:00 and I can't really fathom what I'm seeing. I continue to have my mind blown at a scale of this. (ambient music) Time: 15:00 - 15:10 They say The Line is gonna be a futuristic citym that stretches 170 kilometers and run on renewable energy and artificial intelligence. Time: 15:10 - 15:20 They want 10 million people to come live here, like a whole New York city of people inside of this line in the desert. Time: 15:20 - 15:30 (ambient music) Just the digging alone, the amount of earth that they're moving is jaw dropping. Time: 15:30 - 15:40 (ambient music) The magnitude is like they're building mountains out there Time: 15:40 - 15:50 and moving so much earth. (ambient music) Time: 15:50 - 16:00 Now I thought I had seen a lot of trucks before, but as I drove along The Line, I started to get slightly dizzy. Having a hard time processing the scale of all of this, Time: 16:00 - 16:10 all of these machines working nonstop, every hour of every day for years. Moving sand, making mountains Time: 16:10 - 16:20 and carving a straight line into the desert. (ambient music) (wind whooshing) Time: 16:20 - 16:30 All of this seems impossible. So much of the reporting on Neom has been focused on how implausible, expensive Time: 16:30 - 16:40 and delusional this project is. And that's all well and good if that's what you wanna focus on, but to me that's not that interesting. What I'm most interested in understanding is why. Time: 16:40 - 16:50 (ambient music) Time: 16:50 - 17:00 We found a little cave last night and camped here. Solom invited some of his friends out. Hey guys. - Hi. - How's it going? - Good. Time: 17:00 - 17:10 - This is so cool, right? - Yeah, it is. - [Johnny] We all sat around the fire, me listening while they laughed and joked in Arabic. (Solom and friends speaking Arabic) Time: 17:10 - 17:20 And then began cooking yet another delicious meal. Time: 17:20 - 17:30 This time, goat cooked in goat milk with flatbread. Wow, this is awesome. - Yeah. (Solom speaking Arabic) (ambient music) Time: 17:30 - 17:40 - Wow, so good. (ambient music) Time: 17:40 - 17:50 I am admittedly a little groggy after sleeping a few nights on the desert floor. We're just sledding down a massive dune in a car Time: 17:50 - 18:00 and it's as smooth as butter. (ambient music) Time: 18:00 - 18:10 Where they're making Trojena it's gonna be kind of crazy. To have skiing in Saudi Arabia, right? (ambient music) Time: 18:10 - 18:20 - That's a big change here. - Yeah. - It was like a hiking trail. - Yeah. Really? - [Solom] But with this, no, this is new. Time: 18:20 - 18:30 (ambient music) - Today Solom is introducing me to members of his tribe. Is this them? Time: 18:30 - 18:40 Hello. It'll be the polar opposite of yesterday's tour through Neom's construction. He put on his traditional Saudi clothing so as not to surprise the members of his tribe Time: 18:40 - 18:50 that he has indeed become a modern city man. (ambient music) We arrived to a remote patch of desert Time: 18:50 - 19:00 where a few tents are set up. (ambient music) The elder of this family warmly invites me in. Johnny, hi. Time: 19:00 - 19:10 To sit for coffee. (Bedouin people speaking Arabic) And then of course more tea. Wow. Time: 19:10 - 19:20 And at this point, I'm just embracing the caffeine. They tell me that the only westerners they've ever seen out here are the ones looking for oil. And that it's very strange to see me showing up Time: 19:20 - 19:30 to learn about their culture and especially with a camera. Time: 19:30 - 19:40 So how long have you lived here? - [Solom] This is two months here? - Months? - Yeah. - Wow. Time: 19:40 - 19:50 (sheep bleating) I got to meet their animals, extended members of this nomadic family. (camel grunting) Time: 19:50 - 20:00 So this family's been here on this site, and they'll move again when the season tells them to. Time: 20:00 - 20:10 They basically are here grazing their camels and their goats. And God, they've got a beautiful view. Oh my God, those mountains. Time: 20:10 - 20:20 (ambient music) So wait, he's the shepherd? You're the shepherd? - Yeah. - Wow. That's cool. Do you ever get lost in the desert? (Solom speaking Arabic) Time: 20:20 - 20:30 - No. - No, he's a pro. He's a pro on that donkey. These people's lives depend on moving these animals Time: 20:30 - 20:40 through the desert in search for scarce food. (ambient music) A theme I hear from a lot of people who live out here is the... Time: 20:40 - 20:50 just sense of peace and simplicity that they get, that they realize that the city could never bring. Time: 20:50 - 21:00 What do you like about out here that makes you stay? (elder speaking Arabic) Time: 21:00 - 21:10 So when you go to the city... City, no. This is a better life. Man, this sunset is gorgeous. Time: 21:10 - 21:20 (indistinct chattering) Okay. Yeah, yeah, that's good. Time: 21:20 - 21:30 (Bedouin prayer music) (ambient music) Time: 21:30 - 21:40 As the group faces east to perform their fourth of five prayers they do each day, I'm looking west. Time: 21:40 - 21:50 Just over those mountains, the kingdom of Saudi Arabia is digging a giant line in the sand. (ambient music) Time: 21:50 - 22:00 Working day and night to reshape this desert, building their high tech eco city. Time: 22:00 - 22:10 (ambient music) Time: 22:10 - 22:20 For most of its history, this was the way of life out here on this peninsula. And it may have remained such to this day, Time: 22:20 - 22:30 but eventually the Bedouin on this peninsula united, an unbeknownst to anyone, was sitting atop a sea of black gold. Time: 22:30 - 22:40 - [Announcer 3] Oil in commercial quantities, averaging about 200,000 barrels a day. To handle this huge volume, the expanding program requires an increase of permanent personnel Time: 22:40 - 22:50 to a total of more than 15,000 Arabs. (ambient music) - [Johnny] Oil changed everything. The kingdom rapidly modernized. Time: 22:50 - 23:00 - [Announcer 3] The king sees the oil development as the greatest single means to modernize his country and improve the living standards of his people. - [Johnny] All while still maintaining a deep connection Time: 23:00 - 23:10 with Islamic law, and the rules and norms of Bedouin life. Time: 23:10 - 23:20 And despite this rapid modernization, hundreds of thousands of people still maintain the nomadic lifestyle. It is a link to their past. (ambient music) Time: 23:20 - 23:30 Nice. (ambient music) (Bedouin people speaking Arabic) Time: 23:40 - 23:50 - [Solom] They're talking about something that they see it these days. The people travel by like bike- - Cycling, yeah. Time: 23:50 - 24:00 The conversation goes into the night and I knew I had to ask them about Neom. Can you ask them what their thoughts are on all the building that's happening? I have to be sensitive here Time: 24:00 - 24:10 'cause I'm reminded where I am. Saudi Arabia isn't a place where citizens, nomads or not, can speak critically about their kingdom. Time: 24:10 - 24:20 I got nervous looks and vague answers. But one thing is for certain that the Saudi government has been pain Time: 24:20 - 24:30 in compensating anyone who has been affected by these projects. Time: 24:30 - 24:40 Out of respect, I decide not to push it, it's not worth it. Time: 24:40 - 24:50 We're sitting around a huge platter of camel meat and fragrant rice. So where I'm from, there's no camels. Time: 24:50 - 25:00 - Ah. - No camels, I've never seen a camel until yesterday. The elder generously showing his hospitality by finding the juiciest chunks of camel meat and fat Time: 25:00 - 25:10 and passing them to me. Thank you. (elder speaking Arabic) Yeah. And I'm realizing that this moment is a glimpse into one of the oldest surviving cultures on earth. Time: 25:10 - 25:20 (elder speaking Arabic) (ambient music) Thank you. Time: 25:20 - 25:30 (Bedouin people speaking Arabic) The family invites us to sleep near their tent. Another night, another sky full of stars. Time: 25:30 - 25:40 (ambient music) I'm really feeling it, just how fast the change has come to this desert, where nomads whose movement Time: 25:40 - 25:50 and lifestyle hark back to the earliest civilizations and who are now living a stones throw away Time: 25:50 - 26:00 from the construction of a futuristic city that is attempting to define the next chapter of human civilization. (ambient music) Time: 26:00 - 26:10 It feels like too much to process. (ambient music) Time: 26:10 - 26:20 I couldn't help but feel worried Time: 26:20 - 26:30 for this link to the past. (Bedouin people speaking Arabic) (Johnny and Bedouin people laughing) Time: 26:30 - 26:40 (ambient music) So oil transformed this desert, Time: 26:40 - 26:50 but soon a problem began to arise. (upbeat music) Time: 26:50 - 27:00 Slowly the world has started coming to terms Time: 27:00 - 27:10 with the reality that, burning oil to run our world is turning the planet into a place that's not conducive for human life. Time: 27:10 - 27:20 (upbeat music) The International Energy Agency predicts that the world will hit peak oil demand in 2030, Time: 27:20 - 27:30 at which time demand will start to fall. (upbeat music) Other predictions say it'll take longer, but everyone agrees that Time: 27:30 - 27:40 the future of this world is not oil. This is bad news for Saudi Arabia, a country that has nothing but oil. Time: 27:40 - 27:50 - [Announcer 1] Aramco, the state owned oil company, second quarter profit said tumbling by more than a third from last year's record highs. - Oil transformed this desert kingdom Time: 27:50 - 28:00 into a modern, powerful country. And in order for them to retain that status, they're going to need to use the money from that oil to transform themselves again. Time: 28:00 - 28:10 Enter, Neom. (lively music) Saudi Arabia wants to replace its oil economy Time: 28:10 - 28:20 with new economies, new industries, some of which they want to invent. (lively music) Time: 28:20 - 28:30 This kingdom that has been historically closed is now open, welcoming tourists for the first time. - [Announcer 2] Welcome to Arabia, get your visa now. Time: 28:30 - 28:40 - Let's go to Sindalah. I here. - [Johnny] Hoping to attract the world, this is something neighboring Dubai has done successfully. Time: 28:40 - 28:50 - [Announcer 1] The spirit of Dubai. - But Saudi Arabia plans to do it on a whole new level. (lively music) Time: 28:50 - 29:00 I'll tell you one thing, the water here is beautiful. Time: 29:00 - 29:10 On that note, I was surprised at how welcome I felt here. Every person I met greeted me with kindness and eagerness to show me their culture. Time: 29:10 - 29:20 (ambient music) But it's not just about tourism, Neom is manufacturing, sustainability, technology, Time: 29:20 - 29:30 sports, education, media, and even an attempt to reinvent cities themselves. (ambient music) Time: 29:30 - 29:40 They also want to use all this oil money to stay on top of global energy. All of this hot sun is great for solar energy. Time: 29:40 - 29:50 (ambient music) And while driving around, I saw endless fields of wind turbines. Time: 29:50 - 30:00 (ambient music) And they can use this to make new forms of hydrogen energy that they can ship around the world. Time: 30:00 - 30:10 (ambient music) And the reason why all these promo videos look like a Hollywood movie is because they can't do this Time: 30:10 - 30:20 without investors from the outside world. They need people to come live here. Time: 30:20 - 30:30 - [Wife] So my husband got offered a job for Neom in Saudi Arabia, and we decided to make the move. - [Johnny] They need them to play here, raise children here, somehow have a life here, Time: 30:30 - 30:40 and most crucially to invest in these projects. - And what are we calling it? - The Line. - The Line. - The line. Time: 30:40 - 30:50 - [Johnny] So not unlike a startup, Neom is pitching the world on this impossible sounding vision with the hopes that people will buy it, invest in it, and make some version of it a reality. Time: 30:50 - 31:00 (ambient music) So do you feel excited about it Neom? Time: 31:00 - 31:10 Like- - Yes. - Yeah. Why? - I wouldn't do this business without Neom. - Oh wow. - Before Neom. - Wow. - Everyone wanna like check on internet what is Neom. Time: 31:10 - 31:20 Then they need a tour guide. To have more than 30 tour guides working with me. - Wow. - So it's a big business now Time: 31:20 - 31:30 and it's all because of Neom. (ambient music) - [Johnny] So while Solom is seeing the benefits of this project, the effects for others in this region are less certain. Time: 31:30 - 31:40 We're driving by some of the towns that have been demolished. The people forced to move to make way Time: 31:40 - 31:50 for the construction of Neom. They were given money to rebuild their lives somewhere else. But some refused to leave, Time: 31:50 - 32:00 signing a petition to protest this forced eviction. One even posted to social media voicing his outrage, Time: 32:00 - 32:10 a risky move in a place where freedom of speech isn't really a thing. Soon he was locked in a shootout with security forces that left him dead. Time: 32:10 - 32:20 - [Reporter] This is when Saudi officials reportedly handed over the body of Abdul Rahim al-Huwaiti to his tribe. His family denies the official narrative that Rahim was a terrorist. Time: 32:20 - 32:30 - [Johnny] At least 47 other villagers were detained on terror related charges, and five of them are now on death row. (ambient music) Time: 32:30 - 32:40 The scale and riskiness of these projects Time: 32:40 - 32:50 speaks to the scale of Saudi Arabia's challenge. They need something to keep them afloat after oil goes away, so they're betting the family farm Time: 32:50 - 33:00 on a few massive projects. Many will likely fail, but even if a few of these work out as planned, it could be their next oil. Time: 33:00 - 33:10 (ambient music) Lifting this kingdom into the future, that's the calculus here. (ambient music) Time: 33:10 - 33:20 But what's clear is that this kingdom Time: 33:30 - 33:40 isn't stopping anytime soon. (ambient music) Time: 33:40 - 33:50All this equipment in the desert looks like they're mining for spice.",

      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:10 fruit in the box cereal I mean how did we get here how did this become Time: 00:10 - 00:20 breakfast in my country and what is breakfast even all about some people say it's the most important meal of the day and others say that it's totally worthless and you don't even need to eat breakfast if you don't want to two Time: 00:20 - 00:30 pancakes with hot syrup and butter I bet a lot of you watching don't eat breakfast in the morning and you know who else doesn't eat breakfast in the morning this guy what do you eat for breakfast Time: 00:30 - 00:40 nothing I grew up thinking that breakfast had to be a certain way but then in my 20s I started traveling and I learned that in fact this version of Time: 00:40 - 00:50 breakfast is a very narrow very American version of breakfast once I discovered Time: 00:50 - 01:00 non American breakfast I feel like my eyes were opened to a completely different approach to the first meal of the day I want to show you some of those breakfasts but first let's talk about Time: 01:00 - 01:10 breakfast and how American breakfast got this way for about 22 cents you get as much nutrition as this bacon and egg breakfast when there's no time for your Time: 01:10 - 01:20 regular breakfast okay before I jump into all of my opinions about breakfast let's talk about science for a minute like facts does breakfast matter is it Time: 01:20 - 01:30 actually the most important meal of the day like I was told my whole life you can't be your best if you're doing eat a good breakfast turns out there's data on this lots of studies but you don't need Time: 01:30 - 01:40 to read them all in fact don't read them all let me give you the twenty second version turns out the methods in a lot of these studies are really crummy there weren't randomized controlled trials Time: 01:40 - 01:50 like you know the gold standard for good science and in a lot of cases they didn't really study anything useful they kind of hyper focus on breakfast as it pertains to weight and in most of these Time: 01:50 - 02:00 studies they don't even focus on what the person is eating for breakfast they only focus on whether they do or do not eat breakfast regardless of what they're actually eating and to add to all of Time: 02:00 - 02:10 this a lot of these studies are funded by corporations you have a vested interest in making breakfast seem necessary and healthy so yeah there's a lot of science on this but the science does not come to any Time: 02:10 - 02:20 useful conclusions and is oftentimes just poorly conducted what this means is that there's no real evidence that breakfast is the most important meal of the day and there's nothing special or Time: 02:20 - 02:30 magic about breakfast that's more of a marketing myth than anything else had any really good day's lately like when the Sun shines brighter and people seem Time: 02:30 - 02:40 friendlier and work goes faster days like that well the really good days start out good with new Carnation Instant Breakfast okay wait but there is Time: 02:40 - 02:50 a little caveat earnest if you're like an eight-year-old kid or like a teenager and you're like in school there actually is some useful evidence that says that eating breakfast in the morning is good for your learning and brain development Time: 02:50 - 03:00 so that's the caveat there actually is evidence there for the rest of us though if you like breakfast in the morning eat breakfast in the morning if you're not into that don't do it okay that's that's Time: 03:00 - 03:10 it but unless your kid but I don't know how many kids are watching okay so that's the science on this turns out that I was a person for many years who Time: 03:10 - 03:20 thought that I didn't like breakfast that I didn't need to eat breakfast growing up in a small town in Oregon I didn't have a ton of exposure to other cultures and other things and so my Time: 03:20 - 03:30 version of breakfast was this this is all I knew as breakfast food when we Time: 03:30 - 03:40 would eat like eggs and bacon for dinner we were having breakfast for dinner this food was inseparable from the institution of breakfast if you're not Time: 03:40 - 03:50 from the United States let me just break down what American breakfast is and its story where it came from I'll split it out into two main categories of breakfast in the United States one I call diner breakfasts it kind of looks Time: 03:50 - 04:00 like this and the other I will call cereal which is everything from pop-tarts to Froot Loops to granola bars to Carnation Time: 04:00 - 04:10 Instant Breakfast it's like the quick stuff that's in our pantries that we can Time: 04:10 - 04:20 just consume before work first let's talk about diner breakfast there's no better reference for what diner breakfast is United States than the official menu of I hop which is so inappropriately named Time: 04:20 - 04:30 as the International House of Pancakes welcome to the International House of Pancakes I at IHOP this American Time: 04:30 - 04:40 institution you can start your day with this the stuffed french toast which effectively looks like my birthday cake or you can get really cultured and hop Time: 04:40 - 04:50 over to italy for some Nutella crepes or how about the Belgian waffle combo which isn't just a waffle but also comes with bacon and eggs perhaps you're feeling savory so how Time: 04:50 - 05:00 about this breakfast sampler where you can eat a pig in three different ways because who just wants to eat bacon when you could have all three all of this accompanied by french fries I mean sorry Time: 05:00 - 05:10 hashbrowns but why settle for these meager options when you could go with the Cinna stack pancakes which come layered with a luscious cinnamon roll Time: 05:10 - 05:20 filling and drizzled with rich cream cheese icing and topped with you guessed it with cream icing for breakfast now Time: 05:20 - 05:30 here's the thing this diner style American breakfast is inspired by Europe American pancakes look a lot like other Time: 05:30 - 05:40 sweet flat unleavened breads that are eaten all over the world and especially in Europe we just deemed it necessary to fry it in butter and then put more Time: 05:40 - 05:50 butter on top and then drizzle literal liquid sugar over top and eat it for breakfast that was the only modification we made to this wonderful tradition of Time: 05:50 - 06:00 European pancakes the idea of eating pork based cured meats in the morning is also a European tradition it comes from like the traditional English breakfast which is delicious Time: 06:00 - 06:10 we just decided to get rid of some elements from that like the beans and the tomatoes and the mushrooms who needs those anyway the American waffle comes Time: 06:10 - 06:20 from the beautiful delicious tradition of the Belgian or Liege waffles which are served in Desert Storm Belgium Time: 06:20 - 06:30 they're delicious the modification we made was to eat them for breakfast and then decide to take out the best part which is the pearl sugar the crystallized sugar that makes a Belgian waffle or a Liege waffle Time: 06:30 - 06:40 delicious to summarize this diner style took European traditions turned them into breakfast and modified them by making them lower quality bigger Time: 06:40 - 06:50 portions and usually slathering them with cream and maple syrup you can eat pancakes this cause for all-you-can-eat Time: 06:50 - 07:00 silverware get IHOP's all-you-can-eat pancakes free when you buy any breakfast combo I mean icing for breakfast it's just it Time: 07:00 - 07:10 just doesn't sound good okay so that's the diner version of American breakfast a big important category of what Americans like to eat for breakfast the other category Time: 07:10 - 07:20 looks like this this is the stuff that's in our pantries this is the stuff we eat Time: 07:20 - 07:30 before we go to work it's quick it's what I grew up eating as a child let's call this the cereal category this food came into our lives and became Time: 07:30 - 07:40 widespread because of one main force industrialization with the birth of Time: 07:40 - 07:50 factories and the standardized workday suddenly you had demand for a consistent quick convenient food in the morning to Time: 07:50 - 08:00 feel you for the day compared with that you also now had technology to mass-produce products that would fit this demand perhaps the best symbol of this shift towards mass-produced easy Time: 08:00 - 08:10 convenient breakfast food is cornflakes like the Kellogg C corporation which made corn flakes was a pioneer in making Time: 08:10 - 08:20 this breakfast food popular not only because they were able to mass produce it and cheaply sell it but also because they marketed it in this way that made it feel like the most important thing in Time: 08:20 - 08:30 the world [Music] but there was a problem over time people Time: 08:30 - 08:40 would look at this lousy bowl of cornflakes and be like who wants to eat this this is boring but America had a solution all we needed to do was pump it Time: 08:40 - 08:50 full of sugar one gulp of energy jeez I Time: 08:50 - 09:00 mean that's that's pretty aggressive right there Wow yeah that's how I feel after I eat a pop-tart as well anyway people started to believe that breakfast Time: 09:00 - 09:10 and especially these commodities which were quickly becoming dessert disguised as breakfast were the key to a healthy Time: 09:10 - 09:20 morning and a good start to the day and soon I was born into a world a world where breakfast products and norms were cemented before me a world where Time: 09:20 - 09:30 millions of Americans would wake up in the morning and consume dessert disguised as breakfast your muffin is just a cupcake in disguise that cup of Time: 09:30 - 09:40 yogurt might as well be a scoop of ice cream and then there's the mighty donut the food that doesn't even pretend to be breakfast Time: 09:40 - 09:50 it's just literal dessert and it's like shamelessly just like hey I'm dessert you want to eat me for breakfast and a lot of people are like yeah I mean I kind of respect that I'm kind of like if you're gonna be desert just like Time: 09:50 - 10:00 represent yourself and respect they've done that but wait let me make one thing clear my issues with this have nothing to do with nutrition even sugar or calories or any of that I actually have Time: 10:00 - 10:10 a big issue with our obsession with categorizing food by its numbers and its constituent parts not into that I don't really care my problem here is that I Time: 10:10 - 10:20 don't like this food I just genuinely do not want to wake up and consume dessert for breakfast if you do like this stuff Time: 10:20 - 10:30 for breakfast that's awesome I have no issues with you and I'm not gonna try to convince you to change that but Cinnamon Toast Crunch Lucky Charms and Captain Crunch okay so Time: 10:30 - 10:40 a little bit of time has passed and a few things have changed number one I got a haircut but number two I think I'm cracking the code on how Time: 10:40 - 10:50 to change my breakfast experience I spent the past few months thinking a lot about breakfast and I've started to introduce different breakfast cultures Time: 10:50 - 11:00 into my morning routine that have really changed my world I'm not going to share Time: 11:00 - 11:10 all this with you now because this video would be like 30 minutes long but I have been filming all of this and it has been Time: 11:10 - 11:20 a really interesting journey to invite different breakfast cultures into my world if enough people are interested and you leave comments somewhere I will share it and make a video about what Time: 11:20 - 11:30 breakfast looks like for me these days spoiler alert there's no icing I still have my occasional bowl of Lucky Charms which is a delicious cereal and the Time: 11:30 - 11:40 occasional pancake with my kids it's great stuff I mean I'm not above that food it's just not what I want to eat every morning so anyway I'll show that if you're interested lastly I want to tell you about today's sponsor which is Time: 11:40 -

After\nthe war, the cereal industry started mass-producing sugar-coated cereals and marketing towards children\nin order to make use of some of the over-stocked sugar supplies, thus a breakfast staple weaseled its way\ninto America's pantries across the country.\nWhat the video neglects to tell us is that pancakes have always been thought to be a breakfast item,\nbelieved to be first invented around 1100AD.
