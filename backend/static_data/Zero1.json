      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:10 that's a bit too steep I don't think we'll be able to 65 lakhs done sir thank you sir stay happy sign in Time: 00:10 - 00:20 sign sign it congratulations thank you sir thank you ma'am Time: 00:20 - 00:30 sir I need to talk to you regarding something sir H tell me sir interview 65 lakh ccci which means 5.41 lakhs in hand Time: 00:40 - 00:50 sir I got only 1.36 lak sir beta you don't know how all of these Time: 00:50 - 01:00 things work this means you also don't know how CTC and inhand works don't disturb me with this go and talk to HR wait wait a minute talk to HR no you Time: 01:00 - 01:10 need to understand how this works how CTC and inhand works because when you see those newspapers and colleges and all these people saying you don't need to feel that for Time: 01:10 - 01:20 more you need to understand how this calculation actually works so in this episode of De influencing we thought we'll de influence salary packages and Time: 01:20 - 01:30 I'm talking about those large goodlooking juicy ones because the form over here shouldn't happen you should just understand how it works we'll talk about the good we'll talk about the bad Time: 01:30 - 01:40 cuz certainly these guys won't so let's [Music] Time: 01:40 - 01:50 begin so there's nothing wrong with the big fact CTC the problem is your Time: 01:50 - 02:00 expectation what happens is once you see this you divide the CTC by 12 take out a monthly number and tell everyone now Time: 02:00 - 02:10 everyone's celebrating but what you've done is youve set expectations for society your friends people and yourself and if something happens that changes that reality it causes unhappiness so Time: 02:10 - 02:20 enough with philosophy let's start to decode this entire package so check these two offers out look nice don't they so this one over here is 1.7 crores Time: 02:20 - 02:30 but notice that it's actually an international offer purchasing power of every country is different we also call this living costs for example if you Time: 02:30 - 02:40 look at say Alo or potatoes in India it costs this much here and this much abroad you could do the same thing with say a bottle of water the same thing Time: 02:40 - 02:50 would apply to all other living costs like buying a car taxi traveling etc etc and because of those base costs the living costs increase which is why Time: 02:50 - 03:00 there's a difference in salary sometimes now this changes two things one you are not noticing that there is a price difference of living costs of living in Time: 03:00 - 03:10 India and living abroad the living costs mean that the salaries are also slightly different when you hear about such a package the first question you should ask is job abroad is this job abroad or Time: 03:10 - 03:20 is this job in India now this doesn't mean it's more money it just means that it's more money in Indian rupees Time: 03:20 - 03:30 but anyway let's come straight to the point let's look at an Indian offer and this is a real offer I've removed the details but this breakdown is actually true and let's understand the difference Time: 03:30 - 03:40 between the CTC and the inhand and how they can possibly be a really large difference this offer is of 65 lakh Time: 03:40 - 03:50 rupees you know the one that we gave sadhart and over here we'll break down all these different paths starting from the base salary which is 16 lakh rupees Time: 03:50 - 04:00 huh 16 lakh rupees I thought the offer was 65 lakhs that's exactly my point this is your fixed base salary just you know you will get this no matter what at Time: 04:00 - 04:10 the end of the month and 16 lakhs divide by 12 is a lot less than 65 lakhs divided by 12 up you have to pay tax on this Time: 04:10 - 04:20 obviously so all of this is coming to you but you have to pay income tax obviously but we'll do that in the end Time: 04:20 - 04:30 now that you've understood the base salary let's move on to the next part and that is called the joining bonus this pretty easy to understand a joining bonus is simply the amount you get when Time: 04:30 - 04:40 you join the company and this is amazing it's actual real cash there's no problem over here and you can enjoy it there just two small issues one this is a Time: 04:40 - 04:50 onetime event so it won't happen the year 2 or year three so thinking that entire CTC is yours may not be right because this joining bonus is not a Time: 04:50 - 05:00 recurring amount it happens once second the joining bonus exists so that you stay in the company some of these companies will have a clause that say if Time: 05:00 - 05:10 you leave in the next one or 2 years you have to pay back that joining bonus so well you have to stay back so I Time: 05:10 - 05:20 don't know how you should calculate it but it's a onetime event the next component is esops my favorite esops is 40 lakh RUP is in a 65 lakh CTC that's Time: 05:20 - 05:30 like 60% of the entire offer so what are esops esops is a way for you to create wealth it gives you the option to buy Time: 05:30 - 05:40 shares in the company you're working at so if you're working for a Google and Google takes off you also earn the equity growth of that company and this is fantastic it's actually a great way a Time: 05:40 - 05:50 lot of people have become rich by becoming just ESOP holders and growth in the equity but the understanding is the problem this 40 lakhs doesn't come in Time: 05:50 - 06:00 the first year usually there is a vesting period now let's suppose a vesting period is 4 years vesting period simply means you have to work to earn Time: 06:00 - 06:10 the right to own these esops these options so a 4-year wait and you actually get the amount in the fifth year is a longer duration it shouldn't Time: 06:10 - 06:20 be included in your package because you're not getting it in the first year also if the company goes to zero the value of the e top is zero it's Equity Time: 06:20 - 06:30 we go up together go down together a private company the only way that you can actually cash in or turn your esops which is a piece of paper into money is Time: 06:30 - 06:40 if the company buys back your esops themselves or the company has a liquidation event like it goes IPO it Time: 06:40 - 06:50 gets bought out an investor wants to enter and buy shares from you etc etc in only that case will you actually convert this paper into Cash Time: 06:50 - 07:00 oh of course like every other thing when you earn from an ESOP you have to pay the tax too then we have the retention bonus which is simply a reason for you Time: 07:00 - 07:10 to stay so in this case it's 1 lakh rupees and if you stay for that year you get to keep it but if you leave then you have to pay that 1 lakh back now this could be offered in the second or third Time: 07:10 - 07:20 year completely at the discretion of the company but let me assume for this case it may be non- recording okay the next component Time: 07:20 - 07:30 is performance bonus I love this because people who work in our office are given kras kras and kpis if they don't meet Time: 07:30 - 07:40 the standard of the company which is pretty high you basically won't get that bonus and we have this crazy way of calculating it and HR gives them the Time: 07:40 - 07:50 incentive we call it here if they performed well so well I guess the problem while looking at this when getting an offer is if you do well you get the payout Time: 07:50 - 08:00 otherwise you don't then we have relocation bonus which is pretty simple if you're moving from one city to another there's a onetime payment for you to move this is fine you may or may Time: 08:00 - 08:10 not have it if you're work from home it does not apply if you're not moving cities again it does not apply in many cases people don't even do a relocation Time: 08:10 - 08:20 bonus but we included it because hey we're making a video we have to include everything that's included now you know and before moving to the inhand calculation of the salary I have one Time: 08:20 - 08:30 more component to talk about and that is other allowances this could include stuff like books I can see educational courses food traveling Etc if you don't do any of this and don't take the Time: 08:30 - 08:40 reimbursement you don't get the benefit or if the meal coupons you get for the food just don't work in a restaurant you want you can't benefit out of it but remember these are other perks you get Time: 08:40 - 08:50 with that job and usually upon joining you don't know how to actually claim them but it's a nice little thing to join a nice little company company with some good bucks so as you can see all of Time: 08:50 - 09:00 the components are either one time or they happen at a future date after a few years so what we need to do is find out Time: 09:00 - 09:10 out of this big CTC we have what's our final in hand so if I take 65 lakhs divided by 12 it's 5.4 lakhs a month but Time: 09:10 - 09:20 what's the actual inhand let's see so if I take the 16 lakhs and add the 5 lakh bonus the per month in hand after taxes is Time: 09:20 - 09:30 1.36 lakhs and then you have esops so let's assume there's a 4-year vesting and it's 40 lakhs so you'll get 10 lakhs every year vested remember vested that Time: 09:30 - 09:40 is eligible for a sale but not just vested you need the company to actually do a buyback if it's a private company Time: 09:40 - 09:50 and you need to get it allocated and sell it in the open market if it's a public company so I won't include it over here but now you know now let's calculate the second year salary now Time: 09:50 - 10:00 common sense says that every year you should get some bump in the base salary so let's assume it's a 10% increase and let's say you also got a performance Time: 10:00 - 10:10 bonus I've also added over here A 1 lakh retention bonus uh so there won't be any joining bonus um we are looking at after all these calculations Time: 10:10 - 10:20 it's 1.25 lakhs and of course remember if you leave the job in a year that retention bonus 1 lakh you have to give back cool now that we understand this I think Time: 10:20 - 10:30 there is just one question let's look at what happens in the industry starting with colleges we can see this headline says average Time: 10:30 - 10:40 salary of the college was 28.8 lakhs now that feels amazing and now we know that the average salary was calculated with a Time: 10:40 - 10:50 bunch of stuff that is non- recing and the inhand is different but there's one more aspect to it it's how the average is calculated and I have an actual table over here to show you in this example we Time: 10:50 - 11:00 have 40 students who got 5 lakh rupees we have 25 students and 20 students who got 8 lakhs and 15 lakhs respectively 10 students who got 40 lakh rupees and just Time: 11:00 - 11:10 five students who got 80 lakhs what I want you to notice here is that 40 students Got 5 lakhs five students got Time: 11:10 - 11:20 80 lakhs so here's what you have to notice the mode is 5 lakh rupees which is the most number of students would actually offer 5 lakhs it's the most Time: 11:20 - 11:30 recurring number second the mean is 15 lakh rupees and it's 15 because we have some students who got 80 lakhs offer it them skewed because of that skew they've Time: 11:30 - 11:40 made this imaginary average number of 15 lakh rupees and this is what you see in the newspapers and you feel damn this Time: 11:40 - 11:50 average is very high but the average is because of the skew what you have to look at is actually the median which is 8 lakhs this is the the proper balance Time: 11:50 - 12:00 but not a lot of newspapers or media agencies actually talk about it they talk about that higher number 15 you know why cuz it's juicy but it ain't the Time: 12:00 - 12:10 truth but the problem here is that a lot of people who don't understand this will calculate an Roi based on the CTC and the college fees and Time: 12:10 - 12:20 think let me get this MBA the second thing I wanted to talk about are the social implications so over here when a nice Etc is revealed the college looks Time: 12:20 - 12:30 good cuz it can actually attract more students for a higher fee I'm talking about private colleges the student is happy with this even though he knows the breakup because hey everyone in his Time: 12:30 - 12:40 family is super proud of him and third the entire industry generally looks good that's why this will never break this Time: 12:40 - 12:50 chuckra view is self serving every participant is happy with the narrative I hope you found this episode interesting tell us what other episodes Time: 12:50 - 13:00 we can pick out that we can de influence in the comments below say thank you to the entire production crew it takes a village to make these episodes happen watch all the de influencing series and Time: 13:00 - 13:10 the psychology series more shows are coming out on 01 say something nice in the comments goodbye see you in the next Time: 13:10 - 13:20 episode thank you sir thank you ma'am Time: 13:20 - 13:30 but guys look Founders are amazing Time: 13:40 -

      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:10 peace of mind and be happy. But how can you be happy when you're driving? Suddenly someone cuts you off and insurance premiums rises. Tumhara Ma because he's a rash driver and then I Time: 00:10 - 00:20 was taking a turn. Someone actually threw garbage and our taxpaying money will be used to actually pick it up. So today I'm going to talk about something that we have not. How civic sense Time: 00:20 - 00:30 actually affects us in more ways than you think. Our happiness and also how it's affected financially. Let's do this rule. What's civic sense? Time: 00:30 - 00:40 It's an unsaid rule where you learn by looking at other people on how to behave in public, how to care for the environment, the community, people around you, being polite. But Time: 00:40 - 00:50 unfortunately, we Indians lack civic sense. [Music] Time: 00:50 - 01:00 We did a fun experiment. You see this area over here near the office is quite dirty. So we got it completely cleaned. Time: 01:00 - 01:10 Chucka chon. Very beautiful and span. And this other side of the road was actually quite dirty as well. What Time: 01:10 - 01:20 we did was we sort of added a little bit of litter. And then we observed for a few days on what actually happened. And the result will actually shock you. But you know a lot of my friends living Time: 01:20 - 01:30 abroad say key Indians don't have civic sense because of education. Now near our office everyone's obviously educated that's why there are offices right and this place is dirty. So clearly it's not Time: 01:30 - 01:40 education it's something else. So I found three interesting things of why this is happening and how it's affecting us economically and well just our Time: 01:40 - 01:50 happiness. The first one is tragedy of the commons. This is when you see someone throwing out garbage to keep his car clean or the Time: 01:50 - 02:00 house clean at the expense of the society. When humans exploit shared resources for their own benefit and basically everyone else can't use that resource, that is tragedy of the Time: 02:00 - 02:10 commons. And what's more shocking is that recently there was a yoga day organized in Visac, a community event where you can come learn yoga, perform Time: 02:10 - 02:20 yoga. Good for your health, great for the community. But everyone did this. They ran and started stealing the yoga mats. Literally snatching it from each Time: 02:20 - 02:30 other. But you know what's even more sad? The yoga mats were actually free anyway. So all you had to do was queue up and everything was there for you Time: 02:30 - 02:40 anyway. And that's the sad part. You see, when the community is incentivized to break the rule, as in when someone breaks the queue, he gets the benefit, someone steals the mat, he gets the mat, Time: 02:40 - 02:50 and nothing happens, that's when tragedy of the common becomes worse because everyone is incentivized to break the rule. And then we have road accidents. Time: 02:50 - 03:00 In 2022, India witnessed 4.6 lakh road incidents. That's almost half a million. and that took 1.7 lakh lives. The thing Time: 03:00 - 03:10 is out of this 1.7 lakh deaths, 1.2 happened due to oversp speeded. This means that these deaths could have easily been avoided. I'll tell you one Time: 03:10 - 03:20 more thing. We were in Italy recently and I'm absolutely not comparing our country with another country. But when we were there and I saw 60 km and it was Time: 03:20 - 03:30 an open highway, I could have easily touched 120. But because I was outside and everyone was following the rule, I stayed at 55. And can you imagine this Time: 03:30 - 03:40 side was completely free. Nobody overtook me because it was not considered good civic sense over there. Time: 03:40 - 03:50 And then we have the best of all, theft. And let's take an example of say the railways. We love taking trips in trains, right? There was actually a lot Time: 03:50 - 04:00 of theft in trains as you can imagine. I'm talking about bulbs, pillows, cloth, linen, uh the mugs, anything basically you can pick up was stolen and this was Time: 04:00 - 04:10 260 cr rupees in 2022. And how does this affect us? Well, one it contributes to Time: 04:10 - 04:20 the losses of the Indian railways which means fairs will go up. All of these costs will be passed on to you the taxpayer. you will have to pay a Time: 04:20 - 04:30 high affair because someone stole something. But you know the tragedy of the commons is only one aspect of civic sense. Another aspect is actually Time: 04:30 - 04:40 the broken window problem. So let me give you an example. Imagine you go into Delhi Metro and we sent part of our crew. We said just record the place and Time: 04:40 - 04:50 see if someone is eating or has any kacha in their hand and just try to record them. You'll notice they don't throw or litter across the Delhi Metro Time: 04:50 - 05:00 and it's actually really really clean and well organized. But the same person once he goes down, exits the Delhi Metro, walks on the street, throws it on Time: 05:00 - 05:10 the street. Another example is a normal railway. You enter a bogey, you'll see someone eating peanuts and then they eat the peanut and take the chilka and throw Time: 05:10 - 05:20 it right there. And they do this because everyone else is doing it. No one stops them. They don't stop anyone and they say it's their job. And this is called the Time: 05:20 - 05:30 broken window theory. Basically, if there's a broken window, people find it okay if another one breaks. But if something is pristine and beautiful, people want to maintain it. And this is Time: 05:30 - 05:40 not just about our country getting dirty and we're complaining about it. It also affects our health. 40% of all plastic is thrown on Indian streets. This blocks Time: 05:40 - 05:50 drains and floods and our streets during monsoons. It becomes a breeding ground for diseases. It harms street animals because they're the ones who will eat the trash and it pollutes the soil, Time: 05:50 - 06:00 water, and enters our food chain because that waste just hardly gets cleaned. Now, I know you'll think that when something is dirty in a public place, the government is supposed to clean it. Time: 06:00 - 06:10 But we can't blame the government for our lack of civic sense, right? I mean, look at this example here. street food falls on the street and they go pick it Time: 06:10 - 06:20 up and throw it in a dust bin and the place is clean again. If this happened and you're eating, will you actually bend down, pick up that wet waste food Time: 06:20 - 06:30 and throw it in the dust bin? Another tragedy is tourism. The largest concern of travelers trying to come to India's tourists is I'll get sick. And you'll Time: 06:30 - 06:40 also go on the internet, you'll find hundreds of videos with millions of views where they're showing how dirty India is. And that means other foreigners also think India is dirty. Time: 06:40 - 06:50 And this is really embarrassing for us. Think about the negative impact it has on our country. People don't want to travel and tourism takes a hit. So I Time: 06:50 - 07:00 don't know what the solution to this is, but I found something crazy. As children, we're not really taught to clean up our own mess. Think about it. Time: 07:00 - 07:10 When you eat your food or if there's something dirty, there's either the kwali buy at home to pick that up for you and wash the dishes or it's mommy. Time: 07:10 - 07:20 You don't have in your brain a thought that because it is outsourced to someone else. And a second reason is um more Time: 07:20 - 07:30 embedded in our history. If you look back at India, our society has been divided into this hereditary kind of structure where cleanliness has been Time: 07:30 - 07:40 outsourced to a different part of society, a marginalized part of society which does the cleaning. So because someone else is supposed to do the Time: 07:40 - 07:50 cleaning, all of us don't have a shared responsibility of public ownership of cleanliness. And this is called the endowment effect. The moment you feel shared resources are your own, you start Time: 07:50 - 08:00 to take care of it. Let me give you an example of um Japan. So over there you'll see no ch actually going to Time: 08:00 - 08:10 school all on their own. And once they're in school, they'll even clean their classrooms because it's ingrained in their culture that this shared space is my space. So they actually care about Time: 08:10 - 08:20 it. So when they grow up naturally the entire population thinks of their city, their country as their own and not belonging to somewhere else. Therefore Time: 08:20 - 08:30 they take care of its cleanliness and other things. In India, if you are following the rules, you'll get awkward steps. At least it's happened with me. Now let's start with solutions. But I Time: 08:30 - 08:40 need you to post your solutions before you hear these so we can actually compare notes in the comments. First one starts with cold play. So a friend of ours went to Amanda Time: 08:40 - 08:50 Amanda for the Coldplay concert and I'm sure you've heard of those moon glasses right which make things look all cool. So Time: 08:50 - 09:00 there were 1.5 lakh people going over here and they thought they might not get the moon glasses. So they went to this one guy who had it and there were like 100 200 people there and our teammate is Time: 09:00 - 09:10 telling us that everyone is reaching out and saying glasses. The organizer shouts at the top of his voice saying, \"Not a single person gets these moon glasses Time: 09:10 - 09:20 until you form a clean queue. Everyone formed a single file line and they stood and everyone got those glasses.\" This is Time: 09:20 - 09:30 enforcement. Once you enforce, people will do and you do not incentivize bad behavior. You incentivize good behavior. We need this from the government and us Time: 09:30 - 09:40 from each other. The second is contacting your municipality. If you have an area which needs to be cleaned, they are managing a really large area. Inform them, tell them and you will see Time: 09:40 - 09:50 something happening. You should actually take shared responsibility of everything around you and you can actually affect it. For example, Noida and Delhi actually has an app where you can inform Time: 09:50 - 10:00 them when something is dirty or something needs work and it reaches the correct authority. I mean that's amazing, right? Before we move to point number three, I want you to guess what happened to our experiment over there. Time: 10:00 - 10:10 So the results of the experiment are not surprising. The place which was actually dirty became a little more dirty and the place which was clean continued to be Time: 10:10 - 10:20 clean. We did not nudge anyone over here to do anything. If someone makes fun of you, you should actually be the change. And I'm not saying this as this boring Time: 10:20 - 10:30 philosophical ending. I actually have an interesting story here. Swati and I used to stay in this area in Noida where there was a playground and the playground obviously had lots of Time: 10:30 - 10:40 children and there were six puppies. Now these six puppies were complete strays and the kids were actually kicking each puppy and the puppies were crying and Time: 10:40 - 10:50 every time a boy kicked and the puppy cried everyone clapped and laughed. So we actually did something simple. We didn't say anything to the humans. We Time: 10:50 - 11:00 went to the puppies, put them on our lap and started cuddling them. The puppies quickly went to us and they felt safety and the children said something amazing. Time: 11:00 - 11:10 They said Swati says and the same kids who were kicking actually squatted down and started Time: 11:10 - 11:20 petting and started saying al and their behavior changed in seconds. And I realized humans are exactly the same. The moment you show them what's correct Time: 11:20 - 11:30 and everyone agrees because everyone is doing the right thing, everyone continues to do the right thing. So the change actually Time: 11:30 - 11:40 starts with Time: 11:40 - 11:50The sad reality is this video might never reach the people it is meant to reach...",

Mass awareness – Use influencers, memes, local language content to change mindset.\n5. Better infrastructure – Clean toilets, more dustbins, and proper footpaths help a lot.\n6. Community action – RWAs and local groups can drive neighborhood-level change.\n7. Patriotism = responsibility – Respecting public spaces is real deshbhakti.",

In modern times, this\ncaste bias continues, especially in the sanitation sector, where many workers from marginalized communities are\nemployed in jobs like cleaning drains, sewers, or collecting garbage — often with low wages, unsafe conditions, and no\nsocial dignity.

00:30 and this isn't new this has been happening in supermarkets for a really long time all of these tricks which used to be in the physical world now happen Time: 00:30 - 00:40 online on an app and all these psychological tricks to make you spend more are called Dark patterns and I'm Time: 00:40 - 00:50 not talking about handling fees packaging fees delivery fees I'm talking about really dark sneaky stuff that you have no idea that happens in fact in Time: 00:50 - 01:00 fact if you look at just this bhab Bala cart actually has not one not two Nine dark patterns that you have no idea make you spend 5x more and I'll even rate Time: 01:00 - 01:10 each of them on a scale of 1 to 10 on how dark they actually are and the ninth one will blow your mind so in this episode we're going to talk about dark Time: 01:10 - 01:20 patterns we're going to talk about the good we're going to talk about the bad cuz certainly these apps won't tell you their secret Time: 01:20 - 01:30 let's start with trick number one which I'm sure happened to you I have 200 rupees of discount coupon nice I Time: 01:30 - 01:40 think can you guess how much cash back he got he got a grand total of rupes 1 Time: 01:40 - 01:50 yeah I'm not kidding rupees one on a 200 rup discount coupon you know why because you miss the essential word up to up to Time: 01:50 - 02:00 means between 0 and 200 the app can decide how much discount to give you similarly you'll also find a discount Time: 02:00 - 02:10 coupon which is 50% off up to 100 which means if your cart value is 200 you get 100 rupes off but if your cart value is 1,000 you still get only 100 rupes off Time: 02:10 - 02:20 because up to is the limit and 100 rupes is the limit so it's not really 50% off but I also think a lot of us knew this stock pattern so I'll a rating of 2 out Time: 02:20 - 02:30 of 10 over here let's move on to trickery number two this is how bchara mudit Sunday morning looks like uh beta order some groceries I have Time: 02:30 - 02:40 to make dinner okay Mama H sorry I'll add this also Time: 02:40 - 02:50 this and this order placed I'm sure you didn't notice the dark pattern here so Time: 02:50 - 03:00 he had to order just Tomatoes but the app said if you order a bunch of other things and your cart crosses 100 rupees the delivery will become free so to make Time: 03:00 - 03:10 the delivery free naturally he added a few more items but here is the problem even after adding multiple items his cart was actually just 99 rupees it Time: 03:10 - 03:20 didn't even touch 100 so basically because of that 1 rupe technicality they added a bunch of charges and he ended up overpaying and because this is a frictionless enironment he just quickly Time: 03:20 - 03:30 paid and he had no idea that he overpaid now delivery apps do a sneaky thing that they don't show you what the breakup is and sometimes you have to click and Time: 03:30 - 03:40 you'll see all these charges small cart fee surge fee platform fee handling fee GST on the handling fee how and at the Time: 03:40 - 03:50 end it showed excitingly that I saved money the math is literally not mathing anyways this is called drip pricing and was not invented in India it's happened Time: 03:50 - 04:00 around the world but I think the Indians feel it a little more because her PESA matters so I'll rate this four on the trickery scale because I know I know what you're typing over here you're Time: 04:00 - 04:10 typing that you already know this delete it right now delete the ones you see ahead are going to blow your mind next Point our friend mudit actually experienced another dark pattern which Time: 04:10 - 04:20 you didn't notice and that was this just there just there when he clicked pay do you notice that check he had already loaded money into a wallet Time: 04:20 - 04:30 and it has 1,000 rupees a wallet is basically you've given 1,000 rupees to that company before buying anything and Time: 04:30 - 04:40 companies do this really efficiently they'll say add 100 rup to the wallet and we'll add another 100 rupees to it Etc in many cases you can't actually Time: 04:40 - 04:50 withdraw the cash you have to use it in store and some of these companies even add an expiry date to it which I think is really unfair and definitely a dark Time: 04:50 - 05:00 pattern and Starbucks is notorious for this they have people adding money to their Starbucks app and they had almost 1,500 crores of customers unused money Time: 05:00 - 05:10 sitting in their bank account and they're earning interest wow this rates 5 out of 10 on the trickery scale Time: 05:10 - 05:20 because you can check out anytime you like but you can never leave and talking about not leaving these apps want you to buy something not Time: 05:20 - 05:30 the groceries their Subscription Service once you buy their Subscription Service you get all these benefits like cheaper delivery etc etc and you become a member Time: 05:30 - 05:40 and once you buy a subscription here is what happens the subscription is 133 a month free delivery saves me 20 rupees Time: 05:40 - 05:50 5% off on fruits 10% on groceries and I order 1100k groceries every month but I'm going to go in December sh subscription Time: 05:50 - 06:00 T control kushy control you can do this I order 400k fruits 700 Staples every month but 21 days that means I Time: 06:00 - 06:10 need to order extra stuff 1100 into 21 by 30 no no no fruits Time: 06:10 - 06:20 backup almonds rice chips raisins biscuits that's enough so that means I need to place five orders worth 1533 to save Time: 06:20 - 06:30 money I'm a genius so basically these memberships will save you money but you'll have to Time: 06:30 - 06:40 do a lot of math and be a regular customer for it to actually work in your favor but sometimes it's really confusing and sometimes when you think Time: 06:40 - 06:50 you're not getting the value you want to exit the membership and this is where things get a little interesting you go down to the app you say I want to cancel and then it starts to convince you tell Time: 06:50 - 07:00 you that you should not exit it starts shaming you telling you how much money you've already saved are you crazy and Time: 07:00 - 07:10 then you feel a little bit of guilt and you hit the cancel button and now you're still part of the gym you don't go to because they confirmed shamed you and Time: 07:10 - 07:20 confirm shaming is quite a thing from gym to apps they make you feel guilty for leaving and it works so I give this sneaky little trick because it makes us Time: 07:20 - 07:30 feel guilty a seven out of 10 on the trickery meter anyway this next do pattern actually is a 10 on 10 on the trickery meter but it's so crazy I want Time: 07:30 - 07:40 to save it for the end before that we have this look at this page 450 G for this much money for tomatoes so tell me Time: 07:40 - 07:50 how much does 1 kg of tomato actually cost here now if you go to your local vendor and say by 427 g tom he'll say what Time: 07:50 - 08:00 either buy 500 G 250 g or a kilo but the app doesn't do this the app is selling you 450 G you know why to prevent you Time: 08:00 - 08:10 from actually comparing from your local vendor or any other app because it's tough to convert the metrics and no one will do that math so you can focus on Time: 08:10 - 08:20 what the app wants you to focus on another dark pattern you'll see here is this progress bar this progress bar tells you that you have not done a good Time: 08:20 - 08:30 job on the app you my sir are a loser if you don't add a bunch of other things you will not be able to unlock this amazing thing for free and you think I Time: 08:30 - 08:40 think I want this so let me just add a bunch of more things make this progress bar full so that I can unlock this new character sorry item for free and then Time: 08:40 - 08:50 you also have 50% off on a 10-minute deal there is literally a counter there which is etching into your anxiety ke Time: 08:50 - 09:00 there is a deal out there that's finishing and you should tap tap tap and just add it and order it because in 10 minutes the world will end guys it's Time: 09:00 - 09:10 Anda it's bread it's okay you don't need to have a Target in timer here the interesting thing about all of this UI is not the design and the patterns it's Time: 09:10 - 09:20 that in search of getting something for free you're actually spending way more and the best way to actually become broke is to spend a lot but people do it Time: 09:20 - 09:30 so that they actually have more money it's weird Paradox of consumerism and these apps know exactly how to do that Time: 09:30 - 09:40 to you this sneaky little pattern gets an8 out of 10 because I don't know man it just makes you feel bad when you see it and you just have to do it so eight Time: 09:40 - 09:50 and the next one is going to be the highest rated we've ever seen and it'll probably make you a little sick too look at this the this guy wanted to order Time: 09:50 - 10:00 something from a 10-minute delivery app and he posted on Twitter that he was offered free tomatoes and there is no way for him to exit or remove it but he just wanted eggs he didn't want the Time: 10:00 - 10:10 tomatoes now you might think te he's getting free Tomatoes just take it what if you can't remove it it's fine but Time: 10:10 - 10:20 just below this thread someone replied that he's a vegetarian ordered vegetarian items and he was forced on his basket a free item which was Time: 10:20 - 10:30 chicken guys I understand the pattern may make sense for the company to give something off for free but the problem isn't that you're getting something for free and you don't like it the problem Time: 10:30 - 10:40 is where is the consumer's Choice here in fact if you look at this basket the app has added its own membership without even telling you and there is only a remove button it's not an add button you Time: 10:40 - 10:50 are making a choice for the customer assuming he would benefit from it but the choice is always the customers this is not about free Tomatoes this is not Time: 10:50 - 11:00 about adding a free item like chicken to a vegetarian's item list it's about the customer's Choice how can you add a membership thing to someone who may not Time: 11:00 - 11:10 want it it's so easy to tap tap tap and pay you barely notice these things it's literally like someone reaching into your wallet taking money out and giving Time: 11:10 - 11:20 you nothing because you did not ask for it so this trickery gets a 10 on 10 on the trickery meter the more a company is trying to push you nudge you into doing Time: 11:20 - 11:30 something that benefits them more and you less you're slowly moving into a world which is not built for you it's built for Hungry capitalists who want to Time: 11:30 - 11:40 earn money at any cost and if we don't call this out it becomes an epidemic have you ever noticed any of these things tell us some more stories I'm sure there are more dark patterns out Time: 11:40 - 11:50 there apart from nine Time: 11:50 - 12:00 keeping the most tricky 9thnpoint at the end (and announcing it in advance) for me to watch the whole video, gets a 13/10 on the trickery meter ;)",

      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:10 have two strategies over here that are an alternative to Sips we'll compare them and find out which one is actually better the point is very simple when Time: 00:10 - 00:20 you're making linear progress every time this dot goes up you feel amazing you feel like you're making progress but life is mostly three steps forward and Time: 00:20 - 00:30 two steps back and the stock market is no different when you see lots of lows you can't continue sip because well the Market's falling how can you put more Time: 00:30 - 00:40 money into the market that makes no logical sense and most people stop investing in fact all of this is rooted in real data in a consultation paper by sebbi over here you can see in the first Time: 00:40 - 00:50 2 years of anyone holding a mutual fund a regular plan 73% people quit and by the fifth year 9 7% people have quit and Time: 00:50 - 01:00 only 3% have survived most people quit because of all of this happening and you can see in this table that more and more people are starting their sips but at Time: 01:00 - 01:10 the same time people who've discontinued is 4X of it people don't have the discipline to do sip regularly so your behavior is actually dependent on the Time: 01:10 - 01:20 market cycle but if it's so dependent on the market cycle then maybe we could try a strategy which has lumpsum in it and see if there's a lumpsum versus sip Time: 01:20 - 01:30 strategy here I have a chart over here from October 2008 to October 2015 I'm cherry picking this period because it has something very interesting the Time: 01:30 - 01:40 market did this it just went up now over here if you compare an sip versus a lumpsum who do you think wins think about it the lumpsum investment if you Time: 01:40 - 01:50 invest one lakh over here in in one shot and the market doubles that one lakh has become 2 lakhs but if I did an sip version of it then my entry would be Time: 01:50 - 02:00 here here here here here here here because I'm averaging the entry every single month for all of this time so therefore my entry point will be Time: 02:00 - 02:10 somewhere in the mid and because of that it won't be 100% return it'll be much much less so in the case of a bull run a lumpsum always wins but in the case of a Time: 02:10 - 02:20 volatile Market where the market went down a lot then went up Etc the Sip wins so which is better we don't actually know we don't know if the market is Time: 02:20 - 02:30 going to be volatile a bull market or a bare Market if we knew then B but there may be a clue in this strategy we're going to talk about so first I'll show Time: 02:30 - 02:40 the case of a normal regular Sip and the returns that you'll get you have to understand every part of this properly because then we'll tweak it in the actual strategy we're going to start Time: 02:40 - 02:50 with January 2014 all the way to January 2025 so it's exactly 10 years we're going to assume you're investing 10,000 Time: 02:50 - 03:00 rupes a month and we have mapped the spot amount for nifty50 over here according to that month and based on this invested amount 10,000 rupees you Time: 03:00 - 03:10 get number of units this sip gives you about 12.64% return let's change this a bit think about it 10 years ago you're investing 10,000 then in 2024 you're Time: 03:10 - 03:20 also investing 10,000 like are you so bad at your job that you're not getting a raise of course you are so please use that raise and every year increase that Time: 03:20 - 03:30 sip amount it can't be 10,000 right so over here the Step Up is 10% now of course you can change this number to 5% or 4% or 6% whatever you're comfortable Time: 03:30 - 03:40 with but I'll choose a nice round 10% so if you did 10,000 in the first year every month in the second year you'll do 10,000 + 10% 11,000 so this Excel sheet Time: 03:40 - 03:50 obviously calculates this entire thing and I can see the xirr is 12.83% slightly more than the normal sip think about that for a moment the normal sip Time: 03:50 - 04:00 did about 12.64% and the second one did 12.83% can you tell me why basically you were investing more money when the markets Time: 04:00 - 04:10 were actually in a bull run so if the markets were not in a bull run in the last few years this xir would have actually changed now the actual strategy Time: 04:10 - 04:20 is a normal sip but there's a Twist The Twist is simple when the market Falls you invest a little bit more so let me Time: 04:20 - 04:30 put some numbers to this let's suppose if Nifty fell by 2% then you will basically add 3x of your existing sip as a lump suum and if it falls 5% you'll Time: 04:30 - 04:40 invest 6X now you can change these numbers but I'm curious to know when a fall happens and you do a lump sum and the Sip is also running would that return improve over here you can see Time: 04:40 - 04:50 that the market corrected by 3.56% which is more than 2% so you will do 10,000 C 3x that's 30,000 rupes so Time: 04:50 - 05:00 10,000 + 30,000 is how much you'll invest that month and that month's investment reflects here at 40,000 number of units obviously will increase total units increase and it Time: 05:00 - 05:10 affects your total portfolio value now this also rewies your brain in such a way that if the market is going up AA if the market falls down the AA because Time: 05:10 - 05:20 then you have an opportunity to invest and right here the xir is 13.07% but let's try our final strategy Time: 05:20 - 05:30 this time every year we'll add a step up so we won't just invest 10,000 in the first year second year it'll be 11,000 so on so forth let's see what happens over here I'll scroll all the way down Time: 05:30 - 05:40 you can see the returns over here is about 13.3% the highest among all but there's a problem these numbers are actually not right let me explain the problem is that Time: 05:40 - 05:50 we looking back in time and trying to project our future and we forget why we are investing in you are investing for Time: 05:50 - 06:00 only two reasons one so you feel safe and second so you feel safe this is the Time: 06:00 - 06:10 actual function of money if you look at this strategy there is an assumption the assumption is that you have that extra cash to invest in this lumpsum when the opportunity presents itself and the Time: 06:10 -

00:20 going from sedan to SUV you know there are two things that are affecting your decision which you have no idea about the first one is social and the second one is financial it will make me look Time: 00:20 - 00:30 cool 10 minutes 10 minutes we'll talk about for 10 minutes we'll talk about both these things which will help you and you select a car if you're thinking Time: 00:30 - 00:40 of buying a car let's [Music] Time: 00:40 - 00:50 begin yes sir tell me what do you want to talk about you always teach me invest k diversify portfol Time: 00:50 - 01:00 return now I want to buy a car that's it you tell me you tell me what's the point of me buying a car at the age of 60 when I'm budha my friend bought a car 2 days Time: 01:00 - 01:10 back I want to buy the car right now tell me okay I I understand what you're trying to say you're saying you really want to buy the car and I think you need Time: 01:10 - 01:20 to calm down and you think and you think I'm going to say don't invest in the car instead invest in a mutual fund or whatever stocks or some asset Time: 01:20 - 01:30 I'm not going to say that if you have money you should definitely enjoy it you should buy the car you should buy the home if you like but you should make sure that you can actually afford it so Time: 01:30 - 01:40 we'll just have one conversation understanding why you're buying the car and if it makes sense you should definitely go ahead and buy it and enjoy the car because if you're not enjoying Time: 01:40 - 01:50 life what's the point of investing all your money and sitting and just not well enjoying your life I agree good point you said you look cool the first thing is bro buying a car is actually still Time: 01:50 - 02:00 really rare around you people may be buying cars but did you know one in 12 households actually own a car which Time: 02:00 - 02:10 means buying a car in India is actually rare so you're pretty rich you're getting paid enough so you are buying this car not because you really really need it you're also buying it because Time: 02:10 - 02:20 there's another effect in motion you know what that is fancy t no no social status basically everyone around you will say d Time: 02:20 - 02:30 all these guys who have such great jobs they have SUV and now abish R also has SUV he is also yes you got me nice so here are two Time: 02:30 - 02:40 things you're not thinking of okay one you are actually still in your 20s which means you have at least 50 years of work Time: 02:40 - 02:50 to do okay second thing you actually are buying this to be seen in the society Time: 02:50 - 03:00 not but the truth is when you take decisions based on social status you buy something that you can't afford and because of that in your 30s and 40s cuz Time: 03:00 - 03:10 that's when life really hits you you will not be able to afford those actual Joys but because you you've overs spent in your 20s think about this if you're Time: 03:10 - 03:20 spending more than half of your salary in emis for a card that you don't really require for respect which is effervescent and will go away after some time is it really Time: 03:20 - 03:30 it maybe not but I I want to buy it it will make me look cool but I also want to buy it I want to go out with my friends go out with my fair enough no Time: 03:30 - 03:40 sir I got it basically this is expensive but over you know year on Year I'll get more increment I'll get more growth so at that moment I think I'll a I'll be Time: 03:40 - 03:50 able to afford that car and it'll become cheaper yes correct this is the definition of success stress what stress stress is an expectation where you have Time: 03:50 - 04:00 no control over that something will happen in the future and I will be happier and when that thing doesn't happen it causes stress but you will give me an anxiety I may not sir you Time: 04:00 - 04:10 know what you're always negative do you realize that I a positive person you're always negative okay positive yes tell me so here's what car companies have done because people wanted SUVs because Time: 04:10 - 04:20 people wanted SUVs because people wanted SUVs and it was very expensive they made compact SUVs or SUVs which are under 4 Time: 04:20 - 04:30 MX and they were able to make more affordable compact SUV SUV feels uh of Time: 04:30 - 04:40 course so maybe you should look at those cars sir I want to buy big SUV big SUV big SUV okay okay sunroof okay let's Time: 04:40 - 04:50 let's let's rationalize it a little bit one checklist do you really have a large family to accommodate in an SUV do you really need a really large SV two people Time: 04:50 - 05:00 you're one right are you dating anyone you will it's not about me yes you will second does it actually fit your budget you will tell my budget yes is there a Time: 05:00 - 05:10 formula of course there's a formula everything has a formula and the third thing is have you actually checked its safety ratings does it have airbags is it actually a safe every does it Ser yes Time: 05:10 - 05:20 I also did my my basic checklist and the fourth most important do you actually have the infrastructure in your city to support it offro Time: 05:20 - 05:30 you are 5 minutes away from Office you're in wide Delhi roads I mean your commute is going to be what 6 minutes where will you Offroad it Saturday Sunday I have off I have I have a life I Time: 05:30 - 05:40 will go out okay probably somewhere I don't know on a highway if you say so and the fifth point is do you actually enjoy driving that car there are a lot Time: 05:40 - 05:50 of cars which just look good from the outside but are not a pleasure to drive so have you taken enough test drives to know I will enjoy driving this car because ultimately you to enjoy driving Time: 05:50 - 06:00 the car okay sir I'll enjoy driving the car only if it has a sunroof in it sunroof more cool this is classic upsell I'm sure you went for a test drive yeah Time: 06:00 - 06:10 they gave you the top model and you love the top model and they said sir you look so good driving this car how do you know and you said I agree and you put on your Time: 06:10 - 06:20 Shades so I think if you can afford that the sunroof you should buy it of course you know how affordability works Time: 06:20 - 06:30 how let's talk about it so the net income that you get in your hand after tax that's your disposable income now whatever is the cost of owning your car Time: 06:30 - 06:40 cost emi emi service cost maintenance M service fuel cost put all of that together and get your yearly cost of Time: 06:40 - 06:50 owning that vehicle okay now that amount should not be more than 15% of your disposable income so right now where are you here Time: 06:50 - 07:00 I mean in percentage are you at 15% or less 30 40 40% sh maybe 40% 40% is high Time: 07:00 - 07:10 I can manage he thinks he can manage you think 40% is high I think 15% or low is better I think 40% is bad let them decide and also this 15% 40% is really Time: 07:10 - 07:20 personal this is for people who've done all their basic personal finance so what I'll do is let me show you with an example ex please so let's say you want Time: 07:20 - 07:30 to buy a car actually let's start with your annual income so it's 20 lakh rupees and then let's remove the income tax you'll be left with a disposable income of about 17 lakh rupees okay so Time: 07:30 - 07:40 now let's come to the first section that's the buying cost here we have the onroad price of the car we have your down payment let's suppose it's 20% Time: 07:40 - 07:50 there's a loan amount there's a tenure and of course you have to pay this in 5 years and let's assume it's a 9% loan now I'll also add registration fees you Time: 07:50 - 08:00 notice the total buying cost is 2.78 lakhs compared to the onroad price of the car1 18 lakhs this is your first thing think about it people always look Time: 08:00 - 08:10 at the onroad price and assume that's the expense but after adding all of this well it's actually a little bit more it's 21.7 now let's come to the second Time: 08:10 - 08:20 section which is the operating cost this one's interesting because we have fuel cost per year and I've multiplied this for the entire year we have insurance Time: 08:20 - 08:30 premium per year and then we have an estimated lifespan of the car let's say it's 10 years so the operating cost of the life of the car is about 5.46 lakhs now I've removed inflation and all to Time: 08:30 - 08:40 make this calculation a little easier but let's keep going then we have maintenance cost this is something people forget we have the maintenance Time: 08:40 - 08:50 cost which includes repair and services we have the estimated lifespan of the car and my total maintenance is going to be about 2 lakhs so now here's the interesting bit total cost over the Time: 08:50 - 09:00 lifespan of the car is about 29.2 3 lakhs and the annual cost of owning the car is about 2.92 lakhs so now at this Time: 09:00 - 09:10 point you have a total cost of your actual car and the question you need to ask yourself can I really afford it so this calculator is in the description Time: 09:10 - 09:20 and after you've entered all the values right here is where you'll find out whether you can afford the car yes or no if you use it tell us in the comments if you enjoyed it and learn something new Time: 09:20 - 09:30 or not cool Hello according to you I should buy a cycle you'll thank me later Time: 09:30 - 09:40 rur when later so what I've done is we've put a checklist in the description you check it out download it but going back to what we were talking earlier look dude Time: 09:40 - 09:50 all these social status things you should definitely do right the only problem is this generation has a lot of opportunity if I think about my parents Time: 09:50 - 10:00 time and then they had to stick to that job for a long time they used to plan their future based on that one job dude you will compound yourself to everything Time: 10:00 - 10:10 that you want but if you spend everything now in your 30s and 40s you won't be able to get the things that you work so hard for but what's the point of spending at 40 what I want to have it Time: 10:10 - 10:20 right now what's the number one reason people's personal finance and all their dreams of wanting to buy stuff doesn't work out expenses because the they didn't manage it has nothing to do with Time: 10:20 - 10:30 the career appraisal conery they just didn't manage their money properly isn't that sad tell us if these videos actually make sense you know and what do Time: 10:30 - 10:40 we say next for your appraisal uh don't forget to like And subscribe see you in the next video see you in the next video [Music] YouTube maybe you should look at those Time: 10:40 - 10:50 cars Time: 10:50 - 11:00 appraisal no need because you're rich enough no Time: 11:00 - 11:10Consider GST (48%) + Road Tax (20%) + Income Tax (33%) + Fuel Expense + Maintenance Expenses (Insurance, Service, Wash package, Accident repairs over insurance claim,...)....

00:20 a new one why you always overhyped what happened sir it was sale it was in sale it was affordable for me to buy affordable oh that's exactly how they Time: 00:20 - 00:30 treat people like you perfect so here's the thing right companies marketing teams branding teams product teams spend billions of dollars a year just to Time: 00:30 - 00:40 influence us to buy stuff we all know this right but what about the other side what are the sellers actually doing what do the buyers really think luxury is Time: 00:40 - 00:50 actually a bigger play than you really think and this is a luxurious purchase so let's start with brand Time: 00:50 - 01:00 psychological tricks okay so a brand people create an aspirational brand so you want to buy the product wait one minute why would you want to buy a product uh good features Time: 01:00 - 01:10 technically sound I'll compare it with other phones as well and it should stand out the best nice did you know that sometimes sometimes the best product Time: 01:10 - 01:20 doesn't win the product that everyone wants but can't have and a few get access to actually wins this is where Time: 01:20 - 01:30 branding comes think about Apple right every step of the way when you think of the iPhone here's what happens you open Instagram you see celebrities Dawning this beautiful iPhone important people Time: 01:30 - 01:40 take a photograph and they say sh on iPhone then you go to the Apple Store I know they're not a lot in India but the ones that are look freaking beautiful Time: 01:40 - 01:50 and cool and look how nice that place looks you enter it smells great there's so much of space there's a apple G Time: 01:50 - 02:00 helping you out on what kind of phone to take they're nice accessories then once you buy it you come home there's an unboxing experience by phone sir you Time: 02:00 - 02:10 said the experience is great right and it's a great brand so I'm paying for it no so what's the problem correct it's not their fault that they've built an amazing product great branding great Time: 02:10 - 02:20 experience that's a good thing the problem problem people who can't afford it buy it buy it only if you can really afford it I can afford it it was on sale I know your salary you Time: 02:20 - 02:30 [Music] can't cool one question when did you buy this iPhone uh 2 years back okay and uh Time: 02:30 - 02:40 this iPhone was worth how much 80,000 I think and your salary back then so this is worth how many times your salary back then four months okay hold Time: 02:40 - 02:50 onary is equal to one iPhone because it was good good features I this is good Time: 02:50 - 03:00 you'll stay here longer but it's not good for your personal [Music] finance so tell me how did you go and buy it to for I went to the store and I Time: 03:00 - 03:10 got the box and I unboxed it and the iPhone was on my hand and then I peeled off that screen thing and my iPhone was here and this is exactly why apple is worth a trillion Time: 03:10 - 03:20 dollars it spent so much on its branding to understand exactly what aspiration means ke you will pick an Apple phone Time: 03:20 - 03:30 over another phone which has better features that's what a company does know they'll tell the user about the features hold on if you look at this table over here you'll see that this other phone is Time: 03:30 - 03:40 larger in inches better storage better video the camera is better and the price is cheaper but someone won't go for the better features they'll just buy a lower model of iPhone because iPhone the brand Time: 03:40 - 03:50 the quality feels good it feels like you've made it I won't blame you but you should know that this is happening okay sir I that I understand it's really Time: 03:50 - 04:00 expensive it was for 1 lakh rupes but on the sale I was just getting it for 70,000 only I would have perfect this is Time: 04:00 - 04:10 called a phased out discount congratulations look hear the story very simple there'll be an online e-commerce seller who will say we have this big day where we'll do all these discounts and Time: 04:10 - 04:20 you should get ready you'll get prepped and you'll start saving you'll say okay I'm going to get ready to buy stuff and one day you start getting ads this ad Time: 04:20 - 04:30 says that now your iPhone worth 1 lakh is now at 70,000 rupees which is something that you saw and you feel the anchor is 1 lak 7 yes let me buy Time: 04:30 - 04:40 it correct so this is called the anchor effect where you compare it to 1 lakh versus 70k I'm saying compare it to your salary you know what I'm saying see what Time: 04:40 - 04:50 I did there which is okay no no no no no it's it's problem can't afford it if you can afford it it's totally fine in this case it's not possible anyway they'll Time: 04:50 - 05:00 keep moving from 70k to 72k 72k to 75k 75k to 77k and it'll make you feel ke let me just buy it and this is a psychological trick against you you have Time: 05:00 - 05:10 to look here and not look there and think can I just afford 75k or not if you can then you go ahead and do it we did a bunch of videos explaining how much debt is good debt and that tells Time: 05:10 - 05:20 you what percentage of your salary could be an Emi check that one out video with the the Time: 05:20 - 05:30 Jordan Emi I don't think I can afford it exactly that's the calculation you have to do not this calculation okay sir one more point I can't afford it maybe in Time: 05:30 - 05:40 full cash but I can go for no cost emis no that will save my money actually no cost Emi you're right is no cost Emi but it's not exactly no cost there is some Time: 05:40 - 05:50 cost involved um I can actually find it a cost on the website okay so over here basically so you're paying some interest on uh your emis obviously that's why you Time: 05:50 - 06:00 have that every month installment there is an 18% charge on the interest so that is something you have to bear there is Time: 06:00 - 06:10 also a processing fee that you have to pay that's one thing and actually if you look at this table you'll see over here that the price of the iPhone was 1.5 lakhs the total cost in a no cost Time: 06:10 - 06:20 situation where you think it's actually 150 divided by number of months the total cost is actually 1.55 so of course it it is low but um Time: 06:20 - 06:30 it's not no it's 1.55 there is some amount of payment that you do so is it for real yeah it's real actually I still think no cost Emi is a great invention Time: 06:30 - 06:40 of capitalism but there is one problem the scary thing is how many people are using credit to buy stuff everyone yeah Time: 06:40 - 06:50 actually the number is here it is 70% of people in India buy an iPhone on emis now I want you to guess forget about yourself forget about abishek do you Time: 06:50 - 07:00 think the general public 70% of these guys who've taken an Emi iPhone can they really probably afford it most likely they can't so all these emis are Time: 07:00 - 07:10 actually done by people in your age group 25 to 34 their average salary is 33,000 I'm talking about metros I'm talking about Pune Mumbai Delhi I'm not Time: 07:10 - 07:20 even talking about tier 2 cities I know you're above 33 but uh generally people can't sir if I'm putting in so much money buying that iPhone is also an Time: 07:20 - 07:30 investment for me an investment for you how Now understand this I'm going to buy an iPhone next year the cost is let's after this one you going to buy another one assume a situation and the cost is Time: 07:30 - 07:40 130,000 right I went to the store I gave this phone to him got it and sold this for 30,000 that's a discount no now 1 Time: 07:40 - 07:50 lakh kphone and plus more discounts if at that moment and I'll get it for 60 70,000 it's an investment Time: 07:50 - 08:00 oh my God h no God please no it's completely wrong so this is actually called this um you're on this pleasure Time: 08:00 - 08:10 treadmill okay so here it is when you buy something new you feel really excited about it and then you feel and then normal life kicks in you feel normal about it then a new phone comes Time: 08:10 - 08:20 out and suddenly you don't like it so much so you need a new high and for that new high you just go ahead and buy the new one and then once you have you get Time: 08:20 - 08:30 used to it and then there's a new phone that comes off and you're not happy again and the cycle repeats in fact a smaller shorter version of the cycle happens when you're watching reals you Time: 08:30 - 08:40 watch it it's really funny and then then it gets boring then you move on to the next one and you get a new dopamine hit and a new one and a new one and with every dopamine hit you want just a new dopamine hit and this unlimited Time: 08:40 - 08:50 treadmill doesn't end with just this phone you'll want a charger you want the airpods you'll want a bunch of other things because it'll stay connected oh and you'll always be happy and you'll Time: 08:50 - 09:00 keep spending right and that's not what you want so very simply the best things are available in the world great you have to Time: 09:00 - 09:10 find out whether it's an actual need or a want now if this phone is improving and adding more income to you then it's a need then you should get it but we got Time: 09:10 - 09:20 you the MacBook which is office property and that's what you need it and you have it now if you don't own a phone and you're buying your first phone and you really need it Time: 09:20 - 09:30 maybe it's okay but not in this case dude this is a never-ending treadmill I'm trying to save you money okay sir with this idea no this treadmill idea I'll never buy expensive stuff so what Time: 09:30 - 09:40 am I working for you're working for to actually buy the luxury experience one day correct let me explained correct what you have to do is you have to make sure your Basics are taken care of Time: 09:40 - 09:50 luxury is different from expensive luxury means something that feels nice is expensive but you don't need expensive is it just costs a lot of money you may or may not need that's the Time: 09:50 - 10:00 difference the real tool of money is to act like a safety net the first safety net is yourself road the second safety Time: 10:00 - 10:10 net is your family they should be safe the third safety net is push comes to shove you have to switch a job you lose your job something happens you're Time: 10:10 - 10:20 comfortable for a bunch of months and this is outside of your emergency fund you don't want to touch it the fourth safety net is your skill is so good you are never worried about earning this is Time: 10:20 - 10:30 the real tool of money once you feel safe with these safety nets you will never feel scared and once you're never scared your performance in your work is going to be amazing is that worth a Time: 10:30 - 10:40 phone or a car or no it's not your freedom is the most important thing that you can buy but you let it go because of Time: 10:40 - 10:50 these small things which is why we made this episode so tell me can you really afford an iPhone now so the definition of affordability has changed I'll tell Time: 10:50 - 11:00 you how once I followed your uh followed the basic checklist right uh emergency fund insurances family etc etc now the amount that I have after considering everything now I'll probably see within Time: 11:00 - 11:10 that amount if I'm if I'll be able to buy that product or not is the definition of affordability yeah makes sense Hanah very nice I'm so happy so Time: 11:10 - 11:20 proud of you yes finally he understood if you like this episode this time I'm going to say like And subscribe say nice in the comments and see you in the next Time: 11:20 - 11:30 episode see you T just because T me that's wrong right iPhone it's beautiful you see Time: 11:30 - 11:40 [Music] Time: 11:40 - 11:50Its strange to think that 5 iphone worth of money could buy you a new car, it just shows how grossly overpriced that phone is",

      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:10 6.5%. So in this episode, we're going to answer three questions. One, could the market go up like another 100% from here? Once we answer that, we need to know which one to buy, gold, silver, or Time: 00:10 - 00:20 both? And how much? So that's the second question, how much? And the third question is, how the hell do you actually buy it? Do you buy physical Time: 00:20 - 00:30 gold and silver or do you go digitally and just buy it online? And most importantly, I will give you THC framework. This framework will tell you Time: 00:30 - 00:40 how much of gold or silver to buy and how much money you can actually make. The year was 1991. [Music] Time: 00:40 - 00:50 We were in deep trouble. Our forex reserves were so low we barely had enough to cover 2 weeks of imports. And when Indians don't have money, Time: 00:50 - 01:00 the only thing they have is gold. We pledged tons and tons of gold, physical bars of gold to the Bank Time: 01:00 - 01:10 of England and the Union Bank of Switzerland. This was actually flown in and this footage is actually real. That got us out. And in fact, if you look at Time: 01:10 - 01:20 the economy, we have not looked back. The economy has actually done well. So gold really helped us. It's also true for you and me. When we run out of cash, Time: 01:20 - 01:30 our mothers have gold stashed away somewhere that even she has forgotten. So this is true for all banks in the world as well. This is how central banks Time: 01:30 - 01:40 across the world are buying gold. Do you see 2020 that if you remember is when we had the corona crisis and we have a Time: 01:40 - 01:50 little dip there but after that it's gone up a lot and this is driving demand. As soon as that happens, other investors follow suit and they buy gold Time: 01:50 - 02:00 as well. Central banks buy gold for many reasons. One reason is for example, it's a store of value. Another reason is they want to move away from US. And then there is the biggest reason of all Time: 02:00 - 02:10 Trump. But this doesn't answer the question of silver. If all central banks are buying gold, then why are silver prices going up? Silver is used in Time: 02:10 - 02:20 multiple heavy machinery industries and most importantly EVs, semiconductor chips and all these other things some of Time: 02:20 - 02:30 which I don't even know. People are buying silver because they need to actually use it in realworld application and that's where the buying is coming from. So it's important for you to note Time: 02:30 - 02:40 that most of the demand for gold comes emotionally for silver. It's always been application. It comes from industries. Now, there's a lot of hype around EVs. Time: 02:40 - 02:50 If the EV's demand goes up, you know whose demand goes up as well? Silver. Because silver is used 2x more in an EV vehicle than in normal ICE vehicles. So, Time: 02:50 - 03:00 this means if gold and silver both are going up, we know the reasons for it. We should buy both, right? Look at this chart over here. This is what gold looks Time: 03:00 - 03:10 like and this is what silver looks like. So, we went to the World Gold Council's website and it has a really cool calculator. Here it gives you the correlation or the connection between Time: 03:10 - 03:20 gold, silver and nifty. You see it's 0.749 in green between gold and silver. Meaning a strong positive correlation Time: 03:20 - 03:30 and buying both metals together isn't really a good idea if you're looking to diversify. And in the case of Nifty and Time: 03:30 - 03:40 silver, it's 0.28 in red, meaning the price movement happens in the opposite direction. Nifty and gold is almost 0%. Time: 03:40 - 03:50 Essentially, it means there is no correlation. Now, correlation and all is great, but it doesn't really answer our core question. Should you buy gold or Time: 03:50 - 04:00 silver? But to answer that, you have to understand the currency effect. Take a look at this. So, one thing you should know that all gold and silver that we get in our country is imported. The Time: 04:00 - 04:10 World Gold Council says about 82% or 86% is imported and silver is about 92%. Time: 04:10 - 04:20 Imported. Now when we say imported, we pay in dollars. And here's what it looks like. So let's suppose we as a country are purchasing gold. And let's make the Time: 04:20 - 04:30 numbers a little easy. 1 USD and let's see what happens. So it's the year 2007. Time: 04:30 - 04:40 And 1 USD is equal to roughly 40 INR. I want you to remember this 2007 one USD Time: 04:40 - 04:50 is worth INR and we are paying rupees for the dollar to buy the gold. Now over the next few years, if you go through Time: 04:50 - 05:00 the next few years, I'll make a line up over here. In 200, and this is the same gold, 2022, Time: 05:00 - 05:10 1 USD was worth about 80R. Notice, assume that gold has not changed Time: 05:10 - 05:20 in price. It's the same price because we bought it in dollar denominated terms. that one USD has actually appreciated. INR has depreciated and this 40 has Time: 05:20 - 05:30 become 80. So our investment has doubled just because of this currency effect. Now what this means is gold Time: 05:30 - 05:40 but currency effect. What I mean is that gold is going up but along with it to sweeten the deal the currency is also depreciating in our Time: 05:40 - 05:50 favor. So that effect is also happening and I have actual numbers here. Gold in the last 30 years has given a 7.6% return in USD. But if I include Time: 05:50 - 06:00 this effect then the return is not 7.6 it's 11%. Same thing for silver last 30 Time: 06:00 - 06:10 years dollar return is 6.4%. But if you include the currency it's 9.8% return. Now this USD INR thing is great but it Time: 06:10 - 06:20 doesn't answer how much silver and gold to buy and whether the prices will double from here or the market will fall that I will explain very clearly in the Time: 06:20 - 06:30 THC framework but just before that you should know how to buy it right should you buy physical should you buy digital which is the best way to do let's quickly look at this chart first you Time: 06:30 - 06:40 have gold and silver ETFs you buy and sell them on the stock market just like shares They're super liquid, but remember, you'll pay brokerage fees and a small Time: 06:40 - 06:50 annual expense ratio. Then we have digital gold on fintech apps. It's convenient to buy tiny amounts, but you pay 3% GST upfront, meaning your Time: 06:50 - 07:00 investment is down the second you buy it. On top of that, you'll eventually pay storage and delivery. This is also fine, but you should just know these costs. Then there's the mutual fund Time: 07:00 - 07:10 route. It's a fund that invests in ETFs. But the catch is you pay double the fees. You pay for the fund and also the Time: 07:10 - 07:20 ETF that it holds and you only get the end of day price. The advantage here is if you feel that a manager can actually manage a fund better, then maybe that route makes sense for you. And finally, Time: 07:20 - 07:30 we have physical gold and silver. It's tangible, but it's the priciest option by far. You lose money immediately on GST. Then there could be massive making Time: 07:30 - 07:40 charges. Then there's a locker fee, right? That's the cost cuz you have to store this thing somewhere. So depending on what you value, there's an option for Time: 07:40 - 07:50 everyone. On the other side, when you compare it to silver ETFs, it's a lot better because one, the liquidity is super simple. You can buy and sell it very quickly and all these charges do Time: 07:50 - 08:00 not exist. You are only paying these charges. So there are some charges, but it is relatively lesser. But the downside of an ETF is that the physical Time: 08:00 - 08:10 feeling emotional of going to mama papa and saying coin that does not exist. So if you're buying it for an emotional connection, maybe the ETF doesn't make Time: 08:10 - 08:20 sense. Now comes the most important part, the THC framework. As soon as something hits a high, the Time: 08:20 - 08:30 person over here says, \"Ooh, look at this.\" This includes labubus as well. Look at this. This is true for Time: 08:30 - 08:40 anything from houses to gold to silver. Which is why we made this video. The entire point of this video is so that we can teach you the THC cycle. The hype Time: 08:40 - 08:50 cycle. The hype cycle is everyone's talking about something because it's cool right now. Who was talking about gold 4 years ago? No one. Because it Time: 08:50 - 09:00 wasn't cool enough. But the fact is this doesn't make Nifty bad or gold good or silver bad. It makes our understanding of assets wrong. Everything follows a Time: 09:00 - 09:10 cycle. So why should you worry about whether you should buy in gold or silver? The answer is you should probably choose one of these assets. Do not invest both in large quantities. Keep it small around 5 10% of your Time: 09:10 - 09:20 portfolio or direct 5 10% of your monthly SIP into ETFs of each. But probably as a beginner that's a good Time: 09:20 - 09:30 place to start. Not more than that initially. And do not expect returns in the short term. Think of this as really long. All this narrative in the press saying you 48% return this is all Time: 09:30 - 09:40 nonsense. You are right here in the hype cycle and this hype cycle is messing with your brain. Do not listen to the Time: 09:40 - 09:50 hype in the media. Time: 09:50 - 10:00When you start seeing people  promoting a particular asset, you know the bubble is most likely gonna burst, and the investors are just looking for an exit.",

Over time (because no one knows the future), some\nwill do well.\n👉 There is no best asset class. They all perform, in their own time.\nThank you!",

      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:10 one side, experts are saying that it could go to 1.2 lakhs or even more. But on the other side, we have analysts saying it'll fall 38%. Is this the start Time: 00:10 - 00:20 to a massive bull run that has just begun or will we pause and fall? And what should you do? So, we'll answer whether you should actually buy more Time: 00:20 - 00:30 gold, you should actually hold on, or you should just wait because the market seems like it may fall. I'm sorry for my voice, but that won't stop me from Time: 00:30 - 00:40 actually explaining this. You know, every time the market goes up in gold, there are two kinds of people who emerge. One who say that this is just the beginning, it'll go up forever. And Time: 00:40 - 00:50 second, the kind of person who says don't forget 2012. So in 2012 you can see that just before this the market had gone up a lot and then we went sideways Time: 00:50 - 01:00 for some time and then the market sort of just drifted 2012 13 14 15 you can even include a little bit of 16 and 17 Time: 01:00 - 01:10 because nothing really happened back then and the rise only happened 2019 onward. But if you zoom out a 100 years, you'll see that gold has seen war, inflation, global resets and god knows Time: 01:10 - 01:20 what all that has happened around the world. Yet overall over a period of time it has gone up. So it always thrives in Time: 01:20 - 01:30 chaos in the long term. So the question is what is the chaos of 2025? We have the Russia, Ukraine, Israel, Middle East tensions happening and now we have the Time: 01:30 - 01:40 US and China tariff wars happening. We have the USD currency fluctuations and even qualitative surveys like this where consumer confidence in the economy has Time: 01:40 - 01:50 actually fallen. Whenever people stop trusting economies and the government, immediately they stop thinking about growing their money and people think about gold as safety, right? I mean mom Time: 01:50 - 02:00 has gold in her locker not because she wants a return from it because it makes her feel safe. It makes you feel safe. Think about 2008. In 2008, markets fell Time: 02:00 - 02:10 down around the world and you even had gold falling. But after that, for the next few years, gold went up 150%. When Time: 02:10 - 02:20 people are scared, they put money in gold. Remember this one point. It'll help us answer those three questions. But right now, the scenario is different. We have Trump's equation. That's literally the equation the Time: 02:20 - 02:30 government is using to figure out how much tariff to tariff who. And we asked the team to find out what's this talk about recession and this is what they came up with. There's an inverted yield Time: 02:30 - 02:40 curve. There is survey data. There is analyst data. Everyone saying that the government is likely to trigger a recession in the US which could trigger a global recession. Now the point is Time: 02:40 - 02:50 that I have all the data here and you can see it but there's no point in going through it. What we must understand is these three questions. How does this Time: 02:50 - 03:00 affect us? The takeaway is this. If a recession happens, gold will actually perform. If a recession doesn't happen, well, it'll probably flatline or do nothing. But do you think we can predict Time: 03:00 - 03:10 whether a recession will happen or not? If we could, these analysts would probably have consensus and they don't. Time: 03:10 - 03:20 Maybe the answer is not in all of these global cues and what's happening in India. So, let's analyze what's happening here. You know, in 1991, India had become bankrupt. Time: 03:20 - 03:30 In fact, we didn't have any money to import even 3 months worth of imports. That means we could not run our country. Time: 03:30 - 03:40 So, we did what any household mother would do. We pawned the gold. We took around 47 tons of gold, put it on an Time: 03:40 - 03:50 aeroplane and sent it to London. This actually happened. And in London, once that gold was received, we received a borrowing. It was a loan but we got Time: 03:50 - 04:00 cash. Gold was our safety net in 1991. Gold is your safety net too. It's inside the Indian Time: 04:00 - 04:10 psyche. We have gold in the locker. Worst case, we will be saved. The RBI, our central bank owns about 879 tons of gold and I think it's about Time: 04:10 - 04:20 11% of our total forex reserve. The FM states that the government is not buying gold to replace a currency. So why is Time: 04:20 - 04:30 she saying that? Because the USD is actually the reserve currency of choice of the world. This is a systemic risk. If something happens to that one currency, entire economies could be Time: 04:30 - 04:40 affected. So a lot of central governments are hedging by having a diversified portfolio internationally by having gold because at the end of the day, gold will still have value. But Time: 04:40 - 04:50 there's another interesting thing. I mean, all of us don't buy gold. We buy jewelry, right? like the jewelry that you have in the locker, the family heirloom. But what's happening? Time: 04:50 - 05:00 Something really changed. From 2021 to 2024, gold jewelry demand, the jewelry, right, used to be 610 tons and in 2024 Time: 05:00 - 05:10 it's 563 tons. This may not look like a very big difference, but it's stagnant or falling. However, if you look at people investing in gold online through Time: 05:10 - 05:20 ETFs, in 2022, the total gold ETF was 460 crores. And in 2024, it's 9,224 crores. I mean, that's a massive Time: 05:20 - 05:30 jump. This also means that people still believe gold works and gold is safe. But the mode of acquiring gold is changing. India and a friend of mine actually Time: 05:30 - 05:40 messaged me yesterday saying if markets fall gold will be as a hedge because when markets fall gold will go up and when markets go up gold will go down. Time: 05:40 - 05:50 Correct? No. A lot of people think gold is safe, gold is hedge. Correct? But they also think when markets go up, gold goes down. When market goes down, gold goes Time: 05:50 - 06:00 up. This common belief that gold and equity always move in opposite directions is not entirely true. Between 2006 and 2024, there are only a few Time: 06:00 - 06:10 years where gold went up and equities went down or vice versa. In most years, both actually moved in the same Time: 06:10 - 06:20 direction. So no, gold isn't always the opposite of equity. It's more complicated than that. AB, I know what you're thinking. Put all these things together. Gold is the perfect asset Time: 06:20 - 06:30 class. Nope, it's not. We'll play a game. Okay. Here I have a bunch of data and you have to give me a reaction. From 1980 to 1989, gold gave how much return? Time: 06:30 - 06:40 Pause. The answer is 0%. Let's play again. From 1996 to 2002, gold gave how Time: 06:40 - 06:50 much return? Pause the video. I hope you guessed it right. 0%. And then from 2012 to 2019, I know you're not going to pause the video, it was also 0%. Time: 06:50 - 07:00 However, if you look at these spots over here, these periods, it gave a fantastic return. And this is exactly what happens Time: 07:00 - 07:10 on the internet. When you go online and when you see gold going to 1 lak rupees, the only story you actually want to believe is that gold will keep going up Time: 07:10 - 07:20 forever. No asset class will ever keep going up forever. In fact, the same thing is true for equity as well. So here we can see Sensex returns. It Time: 07:20 - 07:30 doesn't matter how much the return is. All you need to do is actually check how large the bar is over here. Amazing return. Amazing return. Amazing return. Amazing return. Amazing return. If you Time: 07:30 - 07:40 looked at the market just here and invested, your expectation would be here and then next year you would have got nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing. But Time: 07:40 - 07:50 this is also not true that when this happens that equity is very bad. You know this is an oversimplification that equity is good, gold is bad. The truth is you want to own some equity, you want Time: 07:50 - 08:00 to own some fixed deposit or some fixed income, some bonds. You want to own some actually let me just use this some gold because you really don't know when the Time: 08:00 - 08:10 market will go up. And I also want to add another asset class here and I'll do it like this. I'll call it real estate. And I have some real estate data over here. Certain years from 2002 to 2007, Time: 08:10 - 08:20 real estate was going up like crazy. And then we had certain years like 2017 when it wasn't. You know when an asset performs really well like gold is doing Time: 08:20 - 08:30 right now. We feel phobe. Phobi is fear of being invested. Market if the market falls then what? And then if you're not invested then we feel for that I did not Time: 08:30 - 08:40 invest. What if it goes up more? In both cases whether you're invested or not invested you will feel fear. So let's answer these three questions now shall Time: 08:40 - 08:50 we? The first question is, should you buy gold right now? Well, if you're thinking about a really long period based on all what I told you, what do you think? I think you should prepare to Time: 08:50 - 09:00 start investing slowly and have some exposure to gold. Don't go all out. The next is do you think the market will fall from here? So, should I wait before Time: 09:00 - 09:10 I invest? No. We don't know whether the market will go up or down. But it's important to start even if it's very very small. And the habit of doing this for a long term is what will win. Not Time: 09:10 - 09:20 this one move whether the market will go up or not. Nobody knows where gold will go. And third, if the market falls, should I buy a lot? Absolutely not. Your job is to make sure you have little bit Time: 09:20 - 09:30 of money in all kinds of assets. And if you have the habit of investing in them in a long time, you will win. Remember, systems win over a reaction on what Time: 09:30 - 09:40 happens to markets. Let that sit for some time in your Time: 09:40 - 09:50All this is okay and good but I am getting married this year 😭😭 . Worst timing.",

      "title": "SIP or Loan Repayment: The F² Rule A lot of my friends always ask me this question. They say, \"Pratik, I have loans that I have to pay off and I have a sip going on and the investment is growing. So when I get this extra money, an increment or a bonus, should I pay",

      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:10 off the loan so that this actually reduces so I feel lighter or should I invest that money so this investment keeps growing?\" So today I'm going to Time: 00:10 - 00:20 answer it with these two scenarios and the fed formula. So let's assume that you have a home loan. Let's say it's about 20 years and that's your debt. So I'm going to put this in this calculator Time: 00:20 - 00:30 to actually show you what happens. The interest rate is about 8.5%, the loan amount is 40 lak rupees and like I said 20 years. So 240 months. So your EMI is Time: 00:30 - 00:40 roughly 34,000. So now we've assumed a home loan. You can change this to say a car loan or a personal loan and you change the number as per whatever is Time: 00:40 - 00:50 your situation. But we'll stick to this. Now let's say after 1 year after you take this loan you get an increment and now you can afford to invest 10,000 rupees extra and you want to invest this Time: 00:50 - 01:00 let's say in the stock market so there's a SIP I have a SIP calculator so instead of paying off the loan you start the SIP so I'll enter the SIP amount at 10,000 Time: 01:00 - 01:10 on the 13th month because that's when I got the increment so 10,000 rupees. Now if I look at Nifty average over the last many many years, you can see that I have Time: 01:10 - 01:20 um the years on the left from 2000 all the way to 2024 and on the right I have the annual returns. Of course, if you look at only certain areas, it looks Time: 01:20 - 01:30 like Nifty is fantastic, but you'll also have bad years. So the total CAGGR or the average return is about 11.7%. So I'll assume it's 11% for this. Time: 01:30 - 01:40 Now remember, we're calculating over decades and a lot happens over decades. There are a bunch of things that could happen. One, your salary could increase Time: 01:40 - 01:50 in the future. Well, hopefully it'll increase in the future. Second, you might get a bonus randomly in the future. Now, let's suppose in a particular month, the second year, third Time: 01:50 - 02:00 year, fourth year, that year, that month, you want to make sure you want to increase the 10,000 to 11,000, which is 10%. So all you need to do is come here Time: 02:00 - 02:10 put 10% and that will reflect your new reality. So you can actually add a step up here quite easily. So if you do a SIP starting the second year at 10,000 a month assuming a 11% return at the end Time: 02:10 - 02:20 of 20 years your SIP would have grown to 72 lakhs 33,366. Now this amount is our benchmark Time: 02:20 - 02:30 number. So when we run another scenario I want to beat this amount. If I prepay, if I invest, I should beat 72 lakhs, 33,000. Correct? So remember this Time: 02:30 - 02:40 number. But what if you took that money and prepaid the interest? Would you actually save more? But you know what happens when you actually pay a loan? You probably don't. Time: 02:40 - 02:50 And I have something cool to show you. Imagine that you have 10 blocks or 10 lakh worth of loans. So you have one, Time: 02:50 - 03:00 two. So now we have 10 blocks. Each block is one lakh. Now let's say you pay one block or one lakh in EMIs. So your loan Time: 03:00 - 03:10 is now worth how much? 9 lakhs, right? Completely wrong. It's almost still roughly very close to 10 lakhs. So any Time: 03:10 - 03:20 long-term loan that you have, the interest is actually deducted first. So let me show you what this looks like on a real loan of our home. 40 lakh rupees Time: 03:20 - 03:30 balance home loan EMI is 34,000 rupees you'll see that most of the money out of 34,700 28,300 is going towards interest Time: 03:30 - 03:40 and only 6,000 rupees is actually going towards this the actual principal. Then as time goes by this number keeps Time: 03:40 - 03:50 decreasing. The principal portion keeps increasing and at roughly 130 months you can see that they almost become equal before you actually start paying your Time: 03:50 - 04:00 principal more than your interest. This means for the first few years you're basically working for the bank because you're not paying a large amount of this yet. The interesting thing here is that Time: 04:00 - 04:10 when you prepay a loan, that amount straight away is reduced from the principal. So now instead of investing that 10,000 rupees in scenario one in Time: 04:10 - 04:20 the markets, imagine if you took that 10,000 rupees and prepaid every single month, how much money could you save in interest over the next few years? We can Time: 04:20 - 04:30 see that if we did this, our interest reduces from 43 lakh rupees, wait for it, to 25 lakhs. So you've actually Time: 04:30 - 04:40 saved a pretty good amount over here. You'd save 17.6 lakhs. Now a lot of people will tell you that 17.6 lakh rupees is exactly how much you save. But Time: 04:40 - 04:50 think about it. If we trying to figure out how much we saved, we should also deduct that 10,000 rupees that we're spending every single month. So let's Time: 04:50 - 05:00 deduct that as well. Let's be a little fair. And when you add all that up, it totals 13.8 lakhs. So the math is very simple. Time: 05:00 - 05:10 17.6US 13.8 is a grand 3.87 lakhs. 3.87 lakhs is practically Time: 05:10 - 05:20 nothing. And I know what you're thinking right now. You think you figured it out, but you're actually wrong. You're thinking 3.87 lakhs is not a lot, so you should not prepay. you should invest Time: 05:20 - 05:30 because 72 lakhs say and this is where you are wrong. Let me explain why. One thing you haven't noticed is when you prepay a Time: 05:30 - 05:40 loan, you've actually instead of 20 years compress that time frame of the EMI to about 12.5 years. We'll use that time and we'll invest that in the market Time: 05:40 - 05:50 every single month to see what happened. So now I'll open my SIP calculator and in the 151st month that's 12 1/2 years Time: 05:50 - 06:00 I'll add 44,713 at an 11%. And let's see what happens if I pull this Excel sheet all the way to the 20th year. By the end of Time: 06:00 - 06:10 20 years, your SIP would have been 61.1 lakhs extra and your total savings will be 65.17 after you include that three lakh Time: 06:10 - 06:20 that we saved. Not so bad after all, right? What you've not considered is risk. So before I actually reveal the Time: 06:20 - 06:30 final Excel sheet on what is the solution to this prepayment or investment, you should first understand the most important risk you probably haven't considered. And that is Time: 06:30 - 06:40 called sequence risk. Check this out over here. When you look at the returns of Nifty, all I want you to look at is on the left side you have years and then Time: 06:40 - 06:50 on the right side on the extreme you have the returns. Yes, the average return is 11.7%. But the sequence really matters. Time: 06:50 - 07:00 Supposing you started investing in 2008 and sold in 2015. The return would have been a grand Time: 07:00 - 07:10 3.28%. This means the returns are unpredictable. You don't know how much you'll actually average even over say 10 15 years. But the payment in the EMI Time: 07:10 - 07:20 that's guaranteed. So doesn't it make sense that you take that money and actually prepay? Because if you prepay you're guaranteed saving some money. Again, you are slightly wrong. So, I'm Time: 07:20 - 07:30 going to explain this to you in scenario three, the ideal case. Now, think about it. You can't just prepay everything because then you won't have any growth Time: 07:30 - 07:40 capital. Like, what do you do with money growing in case there's an emergency? And you can't also take all of your money invested in the market because you'll always have this tension and stress of paying the EMIs. In both Time: 07:40 - 07:50 cases, if you do them, you'll still be stressed. You need a balance between the two. So, what should you do? The answer is the F square rule or the freedom fund Time: 07:50 - 08:00 rule. Now you could do 60 40 30 70 that's your call but try to do some of both. You can decide what you want to do and this Excel sheet is really going to Time: 08:00 - 08:10 help. So over here all you need to do is put in the type of loans that you have and the percentage and you will know exactly what you should do. It's fully automated. You don't need to do much. On Time: 08:10 - 08:20 the right side it'll tell you whether you should invest more or you should prepay more. And based on this more you can decide how much you want to do. Now if you have a situation where your interest is more than 15%. You should Time: 08:20 - 08:30 actually focus on prepaying that loan first because even the market will give you 10 11%. So what's the point in investing when you have such a large outstanding you know when you look at Time: 08:30 - 08:40 these excel sheets you think that you have figured out life when you drag those cells downwards and you get a nice number. To be honest personal finance and money in particular actually has Time: 08:40 - 08:50 nothing to do with Excel sheets. When you enter someone's newly bought house, you think, \"Wow, he's winning life.\" And another person would enter the same Time: 08:50 - 09:00 house and think, \"Wow, this guy has a loan that's going to last 20 years and he absolutely has to work to pay the EMI.\" One of it feels like a pindra, a Time: 09:00 - 09:10 cage balm. The other one you feel proud. You tell your mother, your parents, everyone, I own a home. So the stories Time: 09:10 - 09:20 that you tell yourself really, really matter. I want you to write down in the comments or somewhere in your notebook on how do you define freedom. Time: 09:20 - 09:30Freedom is being debt free",

00:20 take I want to show it to you on an actual Excel sheet so this is a sip calculator where basically we're investing 10,000 rupees per month we've Time: 00:20 - 00:30 assumed a 12% return now if you scroll down you can see the number of months on the left if I scroll all the way down I can see the market value is about Time: 00:30 - 00:40 23.3 lakhs in about 10 years this is the point where you feel I've been working for a decade let me show you something to Time: 00:40 - 00:50 reflect a little better let's go down to the 15th year 23 lakhs has now become 50 in the 20th year it's now become Time: 00:50 - 01:00 are the second cor happens in just 5 years the third cor 3 years the next cor 2 years fifth cor happens in one year 10 months notice every cor added takes Time: 01:00 - 01:10 lesser and lesser time which means 50% of your journey is actually hitting the Time: 01:10 - 01:20 first one CR and that's the difference between people hitting their first CR or next 10c because it's mostly about mindset and less about skill but let's Time: 01:20 - 01:30 get real can you really hit 1 or even 10 crores with a 50,000 rupe per month salary well we'll find out through the Time: 01:30 - 01:40 strategy pyramid we'll unravel this one by one and answer whether we can actually hit this number or not at the age of 17 when I started to trade I also Time: 01:40 - 01:50 wanted to spend time with my friends so I told my dad I am going to chandigar I'm going to get a job in a call center work the call center and trade so I can Time: 01:50 - 02:00 also have a life because I can't be at home the entire day my dad the next week dropped me to a bus station and said beta problem I'm there don't worry back Time: 02:00 - 02:10 then he was my safety net I could take a huge risk because I knew I had someone Time: 02:10 - 02:20 to fall back on but when you're an adult you're completely alone you have no safety net so you have to make sure before you invest you have to create a Time: 02:20 - 02:30 safety net for yourself in case of hospitalization something happens to your health maybe even there's a layoff and it's called an emergency fund it's a Time: 02:30 - 02:40 very simple fun if your monthly expenditure is 20,000 rupees multiply your monthly expenditure by 6 months or 12 months and this is your reserve Time: 02:40 - 02:50 safety net money The Next Step within the Safety Net Framework is to make sure you're taking care of your family if you have an untimely death then your Time: 02:50 - 03:00 dependence will be affected their lifestyle will be affected and they will not be able to maintain the life they have today which means you must take something called a life insurance a life Time: 03:00 - 03:10 insurance pure term insurance basically gives them money in case of your untimely death now for you to get there Time: 03:10 - 03:20 you need to be healthy therefore you should also get health insurance and health insurance is non-negotiable for two reasons one medical cost are going Time: 03:20 - 03:30 up by 11% a year that's almost equal to Nifty which means it's going to get more and more and more expensive every year second if you actually earn a lot of Time: 03:30 - 03:40 money even if it's not one CR if you get sick or a family member gets sick all that money is going there because this costs a lot and if you have corporate Time: 03:40 - 03:50 Insurance let me tell you that is not enough you need enough coverage and this is a simple formula to actually use and now we'll go to level two of our Time: 03:50 - 04:00 strategy pyramid and this is investing enough you see guys a lot of people start with a monthly sip of 1,000 2,000 3,000 this is great because it starts Time: 04:00 - 04:10 the habit of investing but I think you should find a way to invest 20% or more of your income in markets the reason is Time: 04:10 - 04:20 simple 12% cagr to be honest is mostly an informed guess no one really knows what your portfolio CGR is going to be so when you're selecting a mutual fund Time: 04:20 - 04:30 there are two options regular and direct now if you have a financial adviser a regular fund actually makes sense and you'll be paying him a fee but that's good because he's there to help you out Time: 04:30 - 04:40 but if you're a do it your self- investor you should pick a direct fund where the fees is less and this research by value research is really insightful Time: 04:40 - 04:50 for 20 years if someone invested this amount the difference between a direct plan and a regular plan shows a difference of almost 20 lakh rupes and Time: 04:50 - 05:00 the difference in this example is only 1% that 1% compounds over many years and creates a difference of 20 LHS now let's move to my favorite part in the entire Time: 05:00 - 05:10 strategy pyramid and that's lifestyle inflation now you've probably heard of normal inflation this is a basket of goods and the government says it's moved Time: 05:10 - 05:20 up by so much so you have 6% 7% the cost of living is increasing but has the cost of living actually increased by 6% for you for the last 2 years I'm sure you Time: 05:20 - 05:30 would have spent a lot more where did it go it went on the niceties of life you know the sexy things like the nicer shoes the better apartment because it Time: 05:30 - 05:40 has a better view you're basically doing discretionary spending stuff that even if you don't do it'll not affect your life as much but it does affect how you feel and I'm not saying buying an iPhone Time: 05:40 - 05:50 or a Mac or a Apple watch is a bad thing it's bad only if you can't really afford it you know a friend of mine for the longest time was at about 1.2 lakh rupes Time: 05:50 - 06:00 a month and for whatever reason he suddenly jumped to 2 lakh rupees a month I was so so happy for him this gentleman Time: 06:00 - 06:10 is older than me he's about 45 years old and I think he totally deserves it he's worked his entire life but when I spoke to him on the phone he told me you know Time: 06:10 - 06:20 I have another friend who earns one CR he's immediately comparing himself to the guy who makes one and I asked him how do you feel about that he said well I won't be able to get a really nice car Time: 06:20 - 06:30 but it's okay it's true the grass is always greener on the other side because it's fertilized with you will always want something more so here is my Time: 06:30 - 06:40 solution to you to break this chuckra view as soon as you get your 50,000 Rupees a month take that amount and immediately put it in your sip so now Time: 06:40 - 06:50 that investment has left the account you can't spend it second take a second amount from it where you will use your lavish spendings and put it in a different account make it a little tough to actually access don't have a credit Time: 06:50 - 07:00 or a debit card attached to it now what's left is what you see in your account you'll see a smaller number automatically you'll adjust your life Time: 07:00 - 07:10 based on that amount now when you want to buy a PS5 or a new laptop you'll have to make an effort to transfer the money from that account to this account and then make the purchase it adds a little Time: 07:10 - 07:20 bit of friction when you add friction you can actually make better choices because when you see money on your account Time: 07:20 - 07:30 it vanishes and this brings us to the most interesting part of the pyramid but I want you to guess what it is it's an investment product that gives really Time: 07:30 - 07:40 good returns let me explain when you're investing in Nifty at 12% cagr roughly your money is doubling every 6 years but this scheme actually makes you about 40% Time: 07:40 - 07:50 cagr which means your money will double every 1.8 years this means your Capital Time: 07:50 - 08:00 will keep doubling faster than most businesses can even do sounds interesting this my friend is the credit card business from the perspective of Time: 08:00 - 08:10 the credit card issuer they charge 40% a year roughly from their consumers which is you and that's how much money they can earn and you wonder why all these Time: 08:10 - 08:20 companies like Visa Mastercard have such beautiful looking charts but remember it works in the opposite way for you so Time: 08:20 - 08:30 every time you take a loan whether it's a car or a house even if it's groceries because that's what you can do nowadays you are doing anti- compounding and I Time: 08:30 - 08:40 want you to write in the comments right now I will not anti- compound the question is this that do you really own these objects or do they end up owning you and 2 to 3 months in a year if Time: 08:40 - 08:50 you're working for the government for the taxes you pay the rest of the months you're working for a bank who are you really earning all that money for so in your journey to your first cor the first Time: 08:50 - 09:00 three steps you have to do but this last step which is avoid debt is something like avoiding Temptation you should not take debt because it's easily available Time: 09:00 - 09:10Hitting 0ne crore is hardest. Once 30-40 lakh is visible in account, Greed for bigger car and bigger house, foreign trip starts to come in dream.",

00:30 shopping we compiled pattern matched and found four stories which were similar to all of them and I'm sure it's also similar to Time: 00:30 - 00:40 you before I tell you about these four money decisions I want to tell you about CA our sixth interview her day starts with the coffee machine and the only Time: 00:40 - 00:50 time she breaks her resting Poker Face is when she gets a message on the first of every single month but when she joined her first job she carried a Heart Time: 00:50 - 01:00 full of dreams and a desire to give her parents their own home but today she can't imagine owning the house anymore because she's buried in a debt of 11 Time: 01:00 - 01:10 lakh rupees this isn't ca's story in fact this is happening to all of us and we don't even know it it starts with one misdirection then the next then the next Time: 01:10 - 01:20 then the next and before we know it our life is completely changed actually let me tell you about the first decision in 2014 I took a flight from Delhi to Time: 01:20 - 01:30 Bombay for a client that I was trying to work with now when I landed at the airport and took a taxi to the meeting I saw ads you know those big Holdings Time: 01:30 - 01:40 everywhere and they all had nike airs on them so this one ad and the smartest people in the world convince me to buy the product sounds like normal marketing Time: 01:40 - 01:50 but you know what the billboard has changed the billboard is now on your phone and the crazy thing is that this is data bag which means they can show an Time: 01:50 - 02:00 ad measure the number of Impressions see how many people clicked and also measure how many people converted and run multiple studies on this ad with different copy and different design to Time: 02:00 - 02:10 find which one is the most addictive and which one converts the most which means you are a test subject and the smartest people in the world are figuring out how to sell something to you every hour Time: 02:10 - 02:20 every day 550 CR internet users and 520 social media us user Lab Rats who can be Time: 02:20 - 02:30 Quantified so you can buy so you can pay so you become poorer this is actually a science it's called the stimulus and Time: 02:30 - 02:40 response Theory which means that people have a certain desire which you stimulate using certain form of ads copy and visual Graphics Des purchas validation rep and then they Time: 02:40 - 02:50 respond with likes and shares which is how advertisers know that something is needed and to fill that Gap they actually run those ads to sell you an Time: 02:50 - 03:00 object and this creates habitual consumerism which means you keep buying stuff even though you don't need it Time: 03:00 - 03:10 because just happened and our parents actually had a great solution to this seeing an ad on a newspaper py the page hearing something in the radio zip Z zip Time: 03:10 - 03:20 next Channel you can always flip the channel on the TV as well but for us the internet has actually brought content and together remember there was always a Time: 03:20 - 03:30 popular group at least I had one and these were the coolest kids they were good at basketball they didn't care about anything and we all Time: 03:30 - 03:40 have these groups back in school that we loved and we would sort of imitate them or at least want to be like them but back then there was no Instagram today Time: 03:40 - 03:50 the most popular kids in schools don't have 10 or 20 followers on the internet they have a million which means everyone wants to talk like them have tattoos like them work out like them have Time: 03:50 - 04:00 friends like them have clothes like them and if they're wearing something from a brand you want to buy it this report from BCG talks about how jenzi uses Time: 04:00 - 04:10 influencers as search engines to find out what's cool what's not what's hot what's cold what should they be wearing what should they be watching and what's the new trend and because of this Time: 04:10 - 04:20 influencer culture the modern billboard isn't a billboard or an ad it's a freaking selfie according to Harvard Business Review 75 % of Brands now have Time: 04:20 - 04:30 a dedicated budget for influencer marketing but why why would they spend money on influencer marketing it's because of originality when someone Time: 04:30 - 04:40 opens up a piece of chocolate casually and says he loves this chocolate and you love this person you are now imitating the most popular kid in school it's the Time: 04:40 - 04:50 best way to sell and C2 fell into this Vicious Circle an aesthetic reel here a beautiful product there and a favorite influencer saying check this out two Time: 04:50 - 05:00 clicks but the problem isn't with the Creator or even the content it's actually how easy it is to pay in other words I'll pay later UPI is the most Time: 05:00 - 05:10 popular between ages 18 to 30 because of convenience people think because it's easy they'll use UPI but because it's Time: 05:10 - 05:20 easy they'll actually spend more you know people who are spend thrifts they should not be using UPI because it's just too easy actually that's not that Time: 05:20 - 05:30 bad because so you think this would stop the downfall right if you don't have it you can't spend it right nope Innovations in Time: 05:30 - 05:40 fintech have brought to you buy now pay later and this used to happen in the past two you would go to your local kirana store and you know you have Time: 05:40 - 05:50 kundan Bay over there and you would buy something and you'd say B I'll give the money later and this was okay until a point where it cost 500 600 rupees and he said said ba please give my money Time: 05:50 - 06:00 time you owe me 500 rupees this way you wouldn't overspend and he wouldn't give too much credit and you'd still be friends and there'd be no interest but Time: 06:00 - 06:10 now this exact same relationship on the Internet is on steroids here you don't know kundan bayya and your total outstanding amount could be 50,000 Time: 06:10 - 06:20 Rupees and maybe you don't even have that muchy most of the iPhones in the country are on credit the interesting Time: 06:20 - 06:30 thing about bnpl is that you can see the transactions Rising so the number of transactions is going up you can also see that the amount in value is also Time: 06:30 - 06:40 going up and most of it is coming from the younger generation it feels absolutely okay because everyone around you is doing it 40% of jenz taking debt Time: 06:40 - 06:50 have unsustainable levels which means they can't actually pay it added to that we also have the growth of credit cards primarily fueled by Millennials and Time: 06:50 - 07:00 genzies you know when we were kids we'd sit down in the drawing room and listen to Dad he and Mom would debate about Time: 07:00 - 07:10 what the next thing we should buy is it going to be a study table or is it going to be a brand new cooler and we had to choose only one and after all of this Time: 07:10 - 07:20 debate we would finally decide and the next month we would go and actually purchase that item there was so much of planning and effort that went into that Time: 07:20 - 07:30 one item which would come into our home but now CA can look into her phone and decide absolutely Al loone whether she should use a 3-month interest free loan Time: 07:30 - 07:40 or a six-month with interest loan for her fifth purchase of month and that's where we saw a shift from PES B to loan Time: 07:40 - 07:50 [Music] P what's the inflation in India 6% right Time: 07:50 - 08:00 you've probably heard this in the news or from the papers but what if I told you this is completely wrong where it comes to your life's context let me Time: 08:00 - 08:10 explain the government calculates inflation by simply looking at this basket over here which has different items now it tracks the prices of these Time: 08:10 - 08:20 items over a period of time and the difference on this chart gives you a percentage increase in this case it's around 6% but but do you really think that all Time: 08:20 - 08:30 of these items went up by 6% for you I really mean you actually open last year's grocery list and this year's list Time: 08:30 - 08:40 with all these items is it actually 6% it won't be because all of us are in a trap of our Ambitions we all want to Time: 08:40 - 08:50 lead a better life and you guys don't belong to this chart over here you guys belong to the sexier chart but this one Time: 08:50 - 09:00 the OT the ordering all of the nice things in life are here and so is your de this is called lifestyle inflation Time: 09:00 - 09:10 and lifestyle inflation is the real inflation you should be tracking and before I tell you the fourth Point think about ca for a moment because her story is all of our stories it starts Time: 09:10 - 09:20 completely normal and harmless you buy a few things here and there there's a shopping spree maybe you go out and maybe you have a meal or two or three Time: 09:20 - 09:30 maybe a little too often C's 11 lakh debt is basically convenience spends plus impulse buys plus lifestyle Time: 09:30 - 09:40 upgrades she definitely can't afford fueled by credit multiplied by time the fourth money decision is actually a challenge every generation has a Time: 09:40 - 09:50 challenge that is presented before them that seems really really tough to surmount and for us it's not a war or disease or something that can really be Time: 09:50 - 10:00 bad for an entire life or family it's actually the abundance of everything we have access to unlimited knowledge Time: 10:00 - 10:10 skills money and maybe even the job that you always wanted but the problem in the abundance economy is that you get totally confused and other people Society apps tell you Time: 10:10 - 10:20 what you need to do to be happy but the real secret here is if you can figure out what you want in life and you Time: 10:20 - 10:30 exactly go after that without any outside influence you my friend would have completed the challenge your formula and the right hand side of it Time: 10:30 - 10:40 would say happiness cuz that's all that really matters Time: 10:40 - 10:50Remember this channel is also an advertisement that wants us to save money so that we can invest in markets via Zerodha 🙏",

      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:10 and I have 50,000 right now I need 50,000 more no so 1 lak I think you can do it in 40,000 and that's not possible I need it no no it is possible tell me what if I Time: 00:10 - 00:20 tell you exactly how to do an international trip in 40,000 rupees that is not possible but tell me no think about it safe four steps we look at each Time: 00:20 - 00:30 step we'll optimize it and we'll make a plan for you and then you can get back to work cool so look this is not so complicated Time: 00:30 - 00:40 basically you have these four things to look off in the actual planning of your trip if you can optimize each of them I think we can come to around 40K don't waste your time it's very valuable just Time: 00:40 - 00:50 give me bonus and I'll go 40,000 let's try Step One is flight how do you book a flight what kind of question is it all book of Time: 00:50 - 01:00 Lights app app you so Delhi Delhi to where do you want to go I I'll figure so let's say you go to go to a flight aggregation website like say Google Time: 01:00 - 01:10 flights or Skys scanner you get this option read it says Delhi to anywhere anywhere and you get this Time: 01:10 - 01:20 map swizerland budget bonus bonus correct bonus but you can also see all these cities over here so hoi in is Vietnam Time: 01:20 - 01:30 17K K round trip I'm actually surprised you didn't know this a lot of people use these websites to find out nobody does Time: 01:30 - 01:40 that so we just open our phone open the app type the location and we just book the flight so basically if you know all the locations on this map find what's affordable find round trips what kind of Time: 01:40 - 01:50 pricing is it a direct flight is it a collecting flight can I actually even go to view flights there is even a price graph here so you know what's going to happen when I click on price graph what Time: 01:50 - 02:00 I will actually find out that the prices in February are actually cheaper so this actually tells me the price trend of anywhere I want to go it's not Market Time: 02:00 - 02:10 sir it's vacation no it's data data is awesome so your job is to actually hunt and find out what's the most affordable for you did you notice obviously what's Time: 02:10 - 02:20 the cheapest flight you can see over here correct but it's also 9 hours when the actual flight time is 5 hours and you pay 500 rupes more for the direct flight so what should you really choose Time: 02:20 - 02:30 500 rupes more yeah so make sure it's a direct flight you can choose stops you can choose Airlines you can choose the location the date best most affordable Time: 02:30 - 02:40 place so basically now a little bit of your money now goes to the flight flights to I get it but what about the Visa let's move on to point number two let's just talk about the Visa first so Time: 02:40 - 02:50 now imagine a situation Visa office Vis visa intervie interview and after a couple of days the embassy says Visa rejected Time: 02:50 - 03:00 no no I think a better way to think about this is choose countries you have e visa and it's easier to apply well in Time: 03:00 - 03:10 the list of all these countries you can do e visa visa on arrival a lot of the places that you go the Visa actually doesn't cost so much money what place is that let me show you so basically you Time: 03:10 - 03:20 want to apply for an e Visa we're looking at Vietnam for example over here it's like $20 K around we recently went to Kenya and we applied the Visa can you Time: 03:20 - 03:30 guess in how many days we got the E Visa seven 7 days no less what's your guess 2 actually 10 minutes it's easy it's Time: 03:30 - 03:40 online you can do it yourself and it costs 2 to 3,000 rupees so it's actually not that expensive and you can put that back so it's fine put it back now Time: 03:40 - 03:50 because of this guy we're picking Vietnam but you could pick any other country you want the rules are exactly the same and in the description you'll find the list of the countries with all the EV visas to make it easier Time: 03:50 - 04:00 can we move to the next point the power of your currency what will you do once you're in a new country you'll try the food you'll go to interesting places you'll meet new people you'll try Time: 04:00 - 04:10 activities you can't do over here you'll make new experiences you'll actually expect the unexpected and that's why you're doing it right it's experiences over assets new things over hotels or Time: 04:10 - 04:20 flights what if I tell you everything you do in this country is is so Time: 04:20 - 04:30 expensive that you have to just stay in your hotel and come back for example if you went to say Europe a single bottle of water is € how would you actually enjoy yourself Time: 04:30 - 04:40 I'll take water bottle from India I not go to that country so you want to go to a country the Indian Time: 04:40 - 04:50 currency is stronger against that local currency look at this look at this Nepal rup Indonesian Rupa Bhutan and Vietnamese dong are actually weaker than Time: 04:50 - 05:00 India look at this meal over here this meal costs about €0 2,700 2800 the same meal over here is Time: 05:00 - 05:10 this very big number in Bali for a million Dong or half a million very very expensive this is 500 rupees my point is India is stronger Time: 05:10 - 05:20 currency in Bali than Europe and Bali has some amazing places Vietnam has some amazing places Nepal has amazing places Neal Vietnam take Vietnam you can go and Time: 05:20 - 05:30 figure out the culture the history the war the museum all these experiences is why you're going to Vietnam right to weaker currency helps it's cheaper yes Time: 05:30 - 05:40 moving on to Hotel yes that's the interesting part so I'll stay in a five star hotel budget it's 40,000 total if Time: 05:40 - 05:50 you're going abroad what is the one thing you want to do outside of your travel your hotel and the food chill chill means do you want to meet new Time: 05:50 - 06:00 people H he's a really nice thing if you're going alone right yes okay so if you're going alone you stay in a hostel now let's look at the hostel experience Time: 06:00 - 06:10 you can either stay in a single room just by yourself or in a dorm that's still your choice and this is still cheaper than staying in a fourstar festar hotel obviously because everyone Time: 06:10 - 06:20 over here is seeking Adventure that's why they're in a hostel they're usually young they want to explore the city the hostel is designed to get everyone to Time: 06:20 - 06:30 enjoy themselves so they will plan the trips they will give you options they'll even have activities during the day plan the trip for me for everyone and you can Time: 06:30 - 06:40 join in maybe they want to go for a campfire at night you can join them the hostel itself wants to stir excitement because for them they want you to post on Instagram so they get more customers Time: 06:40 - 06:50 it's optimized for experiences and how much do you think a hostel room costs for a night how would I know I didn't go now roughly it's about uh 2,000 Rupees it's Time: 06:50 - 07:00 not bad totally yeah so we have a little bit of money towards your hostel not a festar hotel so now the big question Time: 07:00 - 07:10 when you're abroad how are you paying for all this how are you paying for all this card credit card so there are actually Time: 07:10 - 07:20 three ways you can do it one is the credit card correct credit debit card second is something called a Forex card what card a Forex card just go to to your bank say I want a Forex card you Time: 07:20 - 07:30 can load money of Vietnam or anywhere else that you're going and the third option is just cash so let's look at one by one what Time: 07:30 - 07:40 you should do is depending on the country you go to you should speak to your bank and ask what is the markup fee the DCS the conversion rate and figure out what's the best option I'm writing Time: 07:40 - 07:50 okay yeah usually the Forex card will be the most effective because the transaction fee and the conversion fee will actually be lower than your credit or debit card that will save me more Time: 07:50 - 08:00 money it will save you some money uh the credit debit card is good for emergency then cash is really good you should carry some cash but actual cash you should carry of Time: 08:00 - 08:10 the local place because some places may not have a posos machine and you cannot transfer it online UPI is not there abroad India is quite ahead at that so Time: 08:10 - 08:20 taking cash is actually quite useful also when you're doing a transaction in a POS machine It'll ask you should you be charged in the local currency or Indian rupees what should you Time: 08:20 - 08:30 pick always no always pick the local currency conversion charge the conversion charge is reduced you save it Time: 08:30 - 08:40 cool oh yes so basically 40,000 Rupees is possible for an international trip if you optimize all these four different plans and make sure that the price is Time: 08:40 - 08:50 actually right so anything is actually possible and now that I don't have to give the bonus he can actually start working Time: 08:50 - 09:00 a Time: 09:00 - 09:10No problem sir let him go on a trip you can hire me i'll do all of his work 😂😂",

      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:10 second calculator is the most important calculator which is the T AZ calculator. Let's start with the affordability calculator first. First you put your Time: 00:10 - 00:20 annual income which is 10 lakh rupees. I've assumed over here you can obviously change it. Then you put in your income tax to get your net income. Now in this case there is no income tax so we'll let Time: 00:20 - 00:30 it be at 10. Then we'll put the price of vehicle X showroom. I'm putting 15 lakh rupees but remember X showroom means exclusive of all other taxes. So you Time: 00:30 - 00:40 have to include it. Call up your car dealership. Ask them onroad price. Get that breakup and include it and put it in this Excel sheet. So we have road tax Time: 00:40 - 00:50 and others. If you're getting accessories other things put in, please add all those costs. Then we have expected down payment. Now generally the expected down payment is 20% of your Time: 00:50 - 01:00 total onroad cost which in this case is adding these two up 20% is roughly 3.2 lakhs. The loan tenure and the interest loan. Make sure you get the exact Time: 01:00 - 01:10 details from your bank so you know what to enter here and you'll finally get the magical number which will haunt you for the next 5 years. Emma amount Time: 01:10 - 01:20 26,882 has been debited from your account. Platform number 8. Now let's see the running cost. Most people actually don't calculate this. So Time: 01:20 - 01:30 if you have say I have already calculated in the comments because now I want you to think that the fuel cost per year is 47,000 and over a lifespan it's 3.3 lakhs. The value of Time: 01:30 - 01:40 your car that you paid 16 lakh rupees and you're spending 3.3 lakhs on just the running cost. Now what I'll do is I'll divide the fuel cost per year by Time: 01:40 - 01:50 12. I'll get 3,929. I will add the fuel cost and the monthly EMI. That means your EMI is not Time: 01:50 - 02:00 26,882. It is 26,000 plus the fuel cost which is 30,800. So almost 31,000 mentally. But actually it's 31,000. Time: 02:00 - 02:10 That's a big difference. And I've not added the other costs yet. Now let's move on to the part we all hate but we must do because the government says we must do it, which is insurance and Time: 02:10 - 02:20 maintenance. So the insurance premium is 25,000 rupees. Please make sure you try to get a zero depth insurance because it's really really useful. Don't just get a third party insurance. The annual Time: 02:20 - 02:30 maintenance cost about let's say 25,000. Then you take these two numbers multiply them by 7 years to get your lifespan cost. So that is 1 lak 75 + 1 lakh75. Time: 02:30 - 02:40 I'll add this total yearly cost and then I'll just divide it by 12 months to see what is this extra cost that I'm adding. Oh, interesting. So this is being added Time: 02:40 - 02:50 to 4,167 rupees a month. Wow. So if I add my previous EMI Time: 02:50 - 03:00 to this new cost, suddenly my every month cost is now almost 35,000. Now let's go to additional costs. You have annual parking expenses. Now I know this Time: 03:00 - 03:10 is different for everyone but I have to assume something. So I've assumed 10,000. I've also assumed some tolls over here. which family trip you'll go somewhere because on Saturday night you Time: 03:10 - 03:20 felt like having those muta parathas and you left at night you paid the toll made unbelievably great memories so we have to add those cost and now we have a Time: 03:20 - 03:30 lifespan cost let's also add this and see what we get 10 + 10 and then I'll put these curly brackets and I'll divide it by 12 months because this is a yearly Time: 03:30 - 03:40 cost and I've got 1,667 so I'll add this my previous EMI to this expense. Now I know my EMI is Time: 03:40 - 03:50 now 36,644 rupees. Now let's look at the total ownership summary. You have a buying cost, you have running cost, you have Time: 03:50 - 04:00 insurance, you have additional cost. The total cost of ownership is not 16 lakhs as you thought. It's actually 27 lakhs Time: 04:00 - 04:10 52,943 rupees. So we can see in the Excel sheet we already have annual cost of owning a car is 3 lak 93,000 and some rupees affordable no why is it saying no Time: 04:10 - 04:20 because it's not 20% of your disposable income and disposable is basically the salary you get after tax but my salary Time: 04:20 - 04:30 will also increase no your salary so you're saying if your salary increases then it becomes more affordable yes okay so let's do Time: 04:30 - 04:40 something let's also include inflation since you're also including salary. So I'll assume salary increment of 8%, I know a lot of you are very good and you'll get more than this but please Time: 04:40 - 04:50 let's be realistic 8%, inflation we'll keep at five. Actually let's keep it at 6%. Now let's turn this into a 7-year table and see and compare your expense Time: 04:50 - 05:00 to your income and see what is the affordability then. So year 1 to 7 I have net income this is increasing by 8% Time: 05:00 - 05:10 every year. That means we started with 10 lakhs and by seventh year it's almost 16 lakhs. Ah beautiful. Then we have down payment. This is the same. The down payment and EMI stay the same. We have Time: 05:10 - 05:20 the running cost which let's assume increases by 6% a year. Then we have insurance and Time: 05:20 - 05:30 maintenance. Insurance will stay the same but maintenance can increase a little bit. So I'll make the increase in this little gradual but there is some increase. additional cost also gradual Time: 05:30 - 05:40 increase and we have the total cost. Now the last column is the most important and it will show you the percentage of your net income versus how much you're spending on the EMI. But remember this Time: 05:40 - 05:50 affordability calculator is not as important as the TAZ calculator which I'll do next. So you can see it goes from 37% all the way to 26%. I still Time: 05:50 - 06:00 think it's kind of high cuz it should be under 20% as much as possible. So now there are two ways to actually solve this issue. The first is if you change u Time: 06:00 - 06:10 some of these variables like the cost of the car obviously everything comes down. So if I change the 16 lakhs to say 12 everything changes. Another option is to Time: 06:10 - 06:20 actually change the down payment from 20% to a much larger number. So let me change this 20% to say 40%. These two things once you change that you do a Time: 06:20 - 06:30 higher down payment and you do a smaller car you actually affect your overall EMI a lot and you can see that the percentage of net income now has come down to 29%. Now you have to keep Time: 06:30 - 06:40 adjusting these variables until this becomes around 20%. Remember the higher down payment you're able to pay the less the EMI becomes the interest also Time: 06:40 - 06:50 reduces and the pressure to pay every month a large sum also decreases. Now it's time for the interesting bit, which is the T A Z calculator. Actually, um, Time: 06:50 - 07:00 can someone take this cuz we don't need this calculator anymore. I need you to find a notebook and a piece of pen and paper. And I want you to draw a line Time: 07:00 - 07:10 between it. And on the right, write the stuff you want to own, like an iPhone, Jordans, and so on. On the left side, I want you to write three to four experiences that you think are out of Time: 07:10 - 07:20 this world. Don't go too crazy, but go a little crazy. And if it's between 1, one and a half lakhs, it's probably just the sweet spot. Put those experiences in and Time: 07:20 - 07:30 see if you can actually afford them. In most cases, if you plan, you will be able to. Now, I want you to next to these write a rating of what do you Time: 07:30 - 07:40 think is amazing. We actually did this with a bunch of people in the office and people started rating the experiences higher and the things lower and everyone Time: 07:40 - 07:50 paused for a moment and said why are you making me do this? I said I wanted to understand whether you want to own things or whether you want to experience things and everyone said we Time: 07:50 - 08:00 love and the younger people said we love and we want to live that life. Then I said, if you're optimizing for Time: 08:00 - 08:10 experience, then why are you thinking about owning stuff? Because when you have an EMI, you won't be able to Time: 08:10 - 08:20 do any of these things from 20s to say 40s. You have lots of energy and you can actually do things. Shouldn't you be optimizing for experiences, things no Time: 08:20 - 08:30 one is doing, things only you can do because you have the freedom of cash? Once you figure that you can optimize life for experiences, nothing feels the Time: 08:30 - 08:40 same. Everything changes because now you're leading a life with an inner compass with something that gives you happiness. Your work becomes better. You're better with your partner. You Time: 08:40 - 08:50 actually produce more creatively because you feel a life which is more fulfilled. I want you to think about what these experiences are. Tell me in the comments because once you experience this, the Time: 08:50 - 09:00 only thing you will ever think about Is this a [Music] [Applause] Time: 09:00 - 09:10 [Music] Time: 09:10 - 09:204 year back my inhand salary was 84k. I bought Tata altroz rhythm for onroad price 7.15 lakh. Only booking amount I paid 30k. Rest 6.85lakh was loan because interest rate was 7.6%. In any condition index fund will give more. My monthly cost 13800emi + 3k petrol+ 500 tool + 1100 insurance + 1000 maintenance = 18400. My need of buying car was just to travel comfortably in sunlight with AC and music.

07:20 say hey I've sent him the tax can you please check and let me withdraw the money the admin says he made you so much money what about his Commission so please transfer another 20,000 for his Time: 07:20 - 07:30 commission this is weird but I guess it's fair I mean you think about it he has been up with you he has been telling Time: 07:30 - 07:40 you what stocks to buy he opened the account helped you in everything I mean you owe him something right so 20,000 rupees cool so you go back to the Time: 07:40 - 07:50 WhatsApp find his Account Details send the imps take a screenshot show it to him and say dude I've sent you the money can I please withdraw my money he said Time: 07:50 - 08:00 yes but you know there is 10,000 more as platform fee that you need to pay at this point you're getting a little frustrated and then he blocks you and Time: 08:00 - 08:10 you have no other way of reaching out to him and you are confused what the hell happened and at this point you realize that you've been scammed the modus Time: 08:10 - 08:20 operandi is very simple most people don't withdraw money from their trading accounts they are driven by greed and and this is the main thing that the Time: 08:20 - 08:30 scammer wants you to do he's feeding off your greed so now let me tell you the red flags of this entire journey and after these red flags I'll tell you how Time: 08:30 - 08:40 to safeguard yourself from fake trading apps so I know in the story you just heard there were obvious red flags but there are some red flags you probably Time: 08:40 - 08:50 did not think of let's begin with one some random person's whatsapping you saying you can make money dude no one should randomly message you and say you can make money from this that itself is Time: 08:50 - 09:00 a red flag second all WhatsApp groups aren't bad but this one in particular sent you a link to download the app now when you clicked on it Google Play store Time: 09:00 - 09:10 opened when you clicked on it Google Play store opened when you clicked on it yeah I'm just repeating the same thing again and again right that was not Time: 09:10 - 09:20 Google Play Store this entire UI is a copy of the Play Store and look at the link above that's not the play. gooogle Android store that's not Google play Time: 09:20 - 09:30 it's just a copy replica so the number of downloads the reviews everything is actually fake in fact you can't click on anything on this page apart from that Time: 09:30 - 09:40 download button now this gives you two problems one is you're not actually downloading from the Play Store it's fake second because it's not on the Play Time: 09:40 - 09:50 Store there's a high chance that there is some malware so they could be stealing data from your phone as well moving on to point number three this is not an actual ual broker which means he Time: 09:50 - 10:00 does not have an actual broking license from the officials now if you look at this screenshot here you'll see that this looks exactly like kite but it's Time: 10:00 - 10:10 not it's actually a fake app the problem with these fake trading apps is that the front end is completely manipulated it Time: 10:10 - 10:20 is not connected to the National Stock Exchange or the Bombay Stock Exchange it's not connected to any of the intermediaries there's basically a guy in a back end who clicks on your account Time: 10:20 - 10:30 puts in an amount for your total amount in your balance selects the stocks changes the prices based on something maybe scraps it off the internet and shows it like prices are changing and Time: 10:30 - 10:40 makes it look like it's real so if he wants he can just move a stock up by 10% and show you in the front end that you've made money when in actuality that Time: 10:40 - 10:50 stock hasn't changed at all then the admin asked us that we have to invest 50,000 nobody I'm telling you nobody in Time: 10:50 - 11:00 the country can force you to invest any amount for any product push tactics within Finance generally is a red flag fifth you sent money directly to an Time: 11:00 - 11:10 individual's account how can you send it to an individual and hope that it reflects in your account that won't happen never send money to an individual Time: 11:10 - 11:20 now notice the scammer said use imps now there are two reasons for it one you cannot UPI more than one lakh to an Time: 11:20 - 11:30 individual account in one transaction and as we saw so actually get the victim to send you a lot of money you have to make sure Time: 11:30 - 11:40 that he can send more than a lakh in a transaction if it's possible so imps has a higher limit the second reason is it just looks really legit saying we do not Time: 11:40 - 11:50 accept UPI and only imps feels like oh there's some rules and regulations that these guys are following so maybe it must be right in fact one interesting Time: 11:50 - 12:00 thing happened in one of the communities we entered we found someone saying click on this link and send us UPI money of 1 lakh rupees and this community was Time: 12:00 - 12:10 accepting UPI so this individual sends us an address not in the app and we clicked on it and the UPI address Time: 12:10 - 12:20 actually said zeroa broking just to make you feel like it's going to a legit broker but actually it was mased it was going to an individual that I thought Time: 12:20 - 12:30 was a little scary but notice the system is made in such a way that when the transaction happens this is debited automatically which means your taxes Etc Time: 12:30 - 12:40 but the scammer was asking you to send him 50,000 rupes capital gains tax that's definitely not how the taxation system works now it's time for me to Time: 12:40 - 12:50 tell you how to safeguard yourself from these trading apps but before I do that there are three points I have to tell you on other ways that people are scamming using fake trading apps but was Time: 12:50 - 13:00 not included in this story the first one is that people run ads actual ads on Instagram on Facebook on your favorite social media platform with famous people Time: 13:00 - 13:10 as their faces this is an actual ad promises lots of money please don't believe such ads I've also seen people Time: 13:10 - 13:20 call from broken apps saying they're working there and say that you are special your account has been selected and and we will give you tips for free Time: 13:20 - 13:30 and teach you how to trade just download this app and we will grow your wealth with you and the worst thing is that some of these fake trading apps are Time: 13:30 - 13:40 actually available on the Play Store and because people aren't sure what's the real name of the broken app they just download this fake app use it and well you know what happens so how do you Time: 13:40 - 13:50 Safeguard yourself one never download anything outside of the App Store just make it a rule it's not difficult second Time: 13:50 - 14:00 if you do find something on the App Store open it up check the reviews check the name of the broker check who the developer is is the developer you know Time: 14:00 - 14:10 someone is the developer familiar is it the same broker or is it someone else check the website if you click on the website check the URL is the name of the Time: 14:10 - 14:20 broker correct is the website actually correct make sure you're downloading the correct broker's application and not just a fake one another way to scam is on the website Time: 14:20 - 14:30 when you click on it you misspell the broken name so I'll use zeroa as an example zeroa could be misspelled as Zera so check the URL for all spelling Time: 14:30 - 14:40 errors there shouldn't be any if the broker is unheard of you should check whether this broker is registered with sebbi I've left a link in the Time: 14:40 - 14:50 description if you don't see the name that's a problem the next thing is that every time you make a transaction there are multiple counterparties confirming whether that Time: 14:50 - 15:00 trade happened or not let me explain when you make a trade for example you will get an SMS which looks like this even in your email you'll get a contract Time: 15:00 - 15:10 note which tells you what amount was debited what was credited so multiple parties telling you multiple things about all of your transactions and if you come across something like this you Time: 15:10 - 15:20 should definitely report it using the cyber crime handle over here because so many complaints were happening we needed one channel one episode to just talk Time: 15:20 - 15:30 about this so cyber do is here to help if you have any complaints you can write to them tweet to them and they will reach out and help if you love this episode wait till you see the episode on Time: 15:30 - 15:40 fake government job scams that are happening in this country right in the comments de influencing Army see you in the next video Time: 15:40 - 15:50The same thing happened to me, but since I know it was a scam, I ended up flipping the script. I told the guy I was having trouble sending the money and suggested he try sending me a small amount first to see if it worked. He actually fell for it and sent me ₹200,so I basically scammed him instead and blocked him 😂.",

So, I'll make sure you can do all of this and you can retire at Time: 00:10 - 00:20 45. Does that make sense? That means you'll never work after 40 or 45 ever in your life. So, Igbar, can you run me by this sheet? What What's over here? So this is my bank balance right now. The Time: 00:20 - 00:30 cash in bank three lakh rupees. Yes, I have three lakhs. Three lakhs. And this you will invest. This I will invest. Yes, I will invest. Pura pura. Yes. Okay. Then you have monthly expense which is 65,000 and you are earning Time: 00:30 - 00:40 67,000 a month. Damn, you spend way too much and basically inflation is 7%. What is this 12% nonsense? 12% sir. 12%. Do Time: 00:40 - 00:50 not assume 12%. We'll reduce this to 10%. An annual salary increment 20%. What world are you living in? 8% later. So basically now what I see Time: 00:50 - 01:00 over here this is this is your age going from 29 all the way to 85. Okay fine. Then we have invested corpus which is Time: 01:00 - 01:10 three lakhs. Correct. This is increasing every year. Here's what we want. We want this corpus should be so big that when you retire even though you're not Time: 01:10 - 01:20 working you can withdraw money from here and this money never ends. Correct. What age I'll retire? So according to according to your sheet at 60 when you Time: 01:20 - 01:30 retire the money finishes at 71. So to survive beyond 70 you will be no money. So basically by the end of this conversation these 20 years that you Time: 01:30 - 01:40 have to work from age 40 to 60 we want to completely eliminate. So after 40 you'll never work again. Correct? So I'll mark this in orange and this will Time: 01:40 - 01:50 be gone. Sir I know what you'll do. So what I know so what you'll do is you'll increase my salary from 8% to 15%. I Time: 01:50 - 02:00 will increase why increase the salary sir. We have to reduce your working years. Why are you changing salary? Come here. I I have to tell you something very interesting. Come. Yes. So what Time: 02:00 - 02:10 you've done over here is you're expecting 15%. 20%. But actually actually look at this. There is the deote report which actually says the average is 8%. And that's why we'll keep Time: 02:10 - 02:20 the salary increment at 8%. Now moving on to the returns. Let's keep it at 10%. My portfolio is giving 20% return. 10% Time: 02:20 - 02:30 actual actual portfolio. Yeah, we'll play a game. 20. Okay. The game will be played by you by me and Aishek. You have to put your score and we'll play it Time: 02:30 - 02:40 right now. It's only going to take 30 seconds. These are the returns for 3 years. Don't use a calculator. The first year is 24%. 14.9% second year, 12% the third year. What's the average? What's Time: 02:40 - 02:50 the average? Uh 15%. Okay. So for the next few years, how much can you expect Nifty to give? Around 15%. Roughly. Roughly, right? This is called a bias, Time: 02:50 - 03:00 recency bias. You look at the last few years and you assume that the same thing will continue forever. So now if you look back, these were actual numbers I Time: 03:00 - 03:10 rounded off. If you go from year 2000 to 2024, you average it, it is 11.7%. Now I'll tell you the third thing before we reduce your expenses and bring them down Time: 03:10 - 03:20 to 30,000. It is actually where is it? It's you. Oh, my portfolio is doing well today. I'll buy my car now. Yes, you're not wrong, Bess. Yeah, I'm not. But also Time: 03:20 - 03:30 look at this right. It's not just you. It's you too. Sebi said in the first one year 50% of mutual funds are actually Time: 03:30 - 03:40 redeemed which means people sell it. Sir, tell me one thing. If I want to buy a car, huh? Then also I'll not withdraw. This is my life savings. No, I'll have to withdraw. Correct. And I think this Time: 03:40 - 03:50 is where personal finance, all this content online gets wrong. Everyone's basically telling you that you should not go to parties, go for vacations, buy Time: 03:50 - 04:00 the iPhone, buy all these things, including us in all of this content we've made. But there is one caveat you have probably not noticed because you have not planned it well. That's why Time: 04:00 - 04:10 you're not able to do it. So what you actually have to do is plan your investments well. And that can be done with the help of SWP , a systematic withdrawal plan. It's basically the Time: 04:10 - 04:20 opposite of an SIP which is a systematic investment plan. Everyone knows it how in an SIP you invest every month. Most people do a month. In an S SWP you Time: 04:20 - 04:30 withdraw every day, month and because you're withdrawing it at a certain rate, the original corpus keeps growing. So you are working till 60. Now this has to Time: 04:30 - 04:40 reduce this orange portion has to become zero. So what I will do is I will keep the salary increment at 20% and Time: 04:40 - 04:50 investment return 12%. Like you had done earlier. Now let's see what happens when we delete this income from after 40 years. Even after 20% increment this Time: 04:50 - 05:00 money will not last beyond 69 years of age. Yeah. Now let's understand why. First look at your expenses. These fixed Time: 05:00 - 05:10 expenses look fine, but you are spending 25,000 every month on party and trips plus 15,000 more on phone EMI. Time: 05:10 - 05:20 No. How do you expect your money to last forever if you keep spending on all this stuff? Instead, you should distribute these big expenses over a period of Time: 05:20 - 05:30 time. Sir, but then how will I buy the stuff that I want? See, even after cutting these out, you are still left with 5,000 and you can spend it however Time: 05:30 - 05:40 you want. So now you are now retired at age 40. And age 41 onwards, how much are you earning? Zero. Now I want you to imagine what will happen at age 40 onwards. You're Time: 05:40 - 05:50 not working at all. Go relax. Relax on the sofa. Age 41. Never working. Go lie down quickly and look up into the sky because now you are financially free. Time: 05:50 - 06:00 Money will last for a long time. One day goes, no work. 6 months go, one year goes, 20 years, 40 years go by and you're absolutely never working again. This is not the definition of being Time: 06:00 - 06:10 financially free. I know you don't want to be compulsive in going to the office and have to work. You still want to work but on stuff you enjoy. Right. Right. Time: 06:10 - 06:20 How much will you earn? At least 40,000 to 42,000 you'll be able to earn every month. Right. Yeah. Let's also consider you will get a 6% Time: 06:20 - 06:30 increase in this income every year. Yeah. Okay. But at 60 I want to stop this freelance work also. Correct. Now let's see. Will the corpus ever end? Time: 06:30 - 06:40 It's increasing forever. This will actually never stop increasing and I'll keep on withdrawing. You'll keep withdrawing from the corpus. So it's 6.84 crores at age 60 and even at 85 Time: 06:40 - 06:50 it's continuing to grow. So the realization here is your retirement is always in your hand. It just depends on Time: 06:50 - 07:00 what you want today. So if you increase the expenses over here, your retirement may never come. So it's fine to buy that car. It's fine to go on that holiday. Time: 07:00 - 07:10 It's fine to buy anything that you like. But it should make sense if it if your money finishes in the future, then maybe you should wait. And remember this is very worst case, right? I don't think Time: 07:10 - 07:20 your salary increment will be 8%. With the way things are going, I think at certain periods of time when you get a spike, there'll be a sudden jump. But at Time: 07:20 - 07:30 that point, if you decide to spend that money, then there is no point of that sudden jump. This sheet does not plan your finances. It tells you that even if Time: 07:30 - 07:40 you save 5,000, 8,000 or 12,000 rupees today, it's going to affect the Abishek of 60 years old. Sir, I have one last question. Yeah. What is the cost of Time: 07:40 - 07:50 freedom? It's an exam of you know in school when you had an exam coming up you can either be the kid who went home Time: 07:50 - 08:00 every day and did a revision and a weekly revision. So he had to prepare very little before the exam. But if you were like some people I was I was always Time: 08:00 - 08:10 prepared. Some people one night before you would study 2 days before the exam. Right? So now you have to decide. Do you want to be the guy who invests a little bit now so that later in life there is Time: 08:10 - 08:20 less pressure and therefore there is less stress and that's how you define freedom or are you the guy who says I Time: 08:20 - 08:30 want to enjoy now I'm going to go play I'm not going to study and I'm going to study one day before the exam in other words I will work really hard in my 40s Time: 08:30 - 08:40 and 50s and 60s and I'll deprive myself of the stuff I may need in the future because I want to enjoy my life today. You don't have to take these extreme decisions. It can be somewhere in the Time: 08:40 - 08:50 middle. What do you want to be? The good student. Time: 08:50 - 09:00 Great video. Need a job first 💀",

      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:10 about why you can't buy it. It's going to be about how you can buy it. And if you can't, what you have to do to actually get there. Time: 00:10 - 00:20 So, here's what you need to do. You need to actually write all these chapters and your answers with me in the comments so all of us can actually learn from each other and figure out how you can Time: 00:20 - 00:30 actually own this home. Here's what happens in real estate. It is not even a scam. I scam is a small word for it. I used to cry you know that Time: 00:30 - 00:40 we are having money in our pocket and we are not able to purchase a flat of our own choice. The first thing you see is a newspaper ad saying almost all units are sold out. Time: 00:40 - 00:50 Let's suppose these are all the units and they say there only one or two left. So the people over here just put a token money and based on the token money they Time: 00:50 - 01:00 say that the house is sold but a token money is not actually selling. So to verify this we went to the RAR website and looked at ads where real estate Time: 01:00 - 01:10 developers said that all of the units are sold and found that the units aren't sold. They're just creating, you know, artificial scarcity. Time: 01:10 - 01:20 [Music] Time: 01:20 - 01:30 He's in jail. [Music] Time: 01:30 - 01:40 9% Time: 01:40 - 01:50 scheme bank I mean builders our own colleague you know again retired person he paid 95% of the amount and he Time: 01:50 - 02:00 was living on he living on rent for 7 years after that you are paying housing loan bank Time: 02:00 - 02:10 installment and you are a retired person. Just imagine Time: 02:10 - 02:20 this is a study by Anorok saying lacks of homes were delayed up to 6 years. Now I want you to think that before you make your decision for this you have to Time: 02:20 - 02:30 factor in that if you're buying an under construction home there are chances probabilities that the project will be delayed and you just won't get your Time: 02:30 - 02:40 home. So this is the first thing you should be careful about. The system is such in India that it might take 60 65 months for you to get possession of a property in India. Sometimes it's not Time: 02:40 - 02:50 the builder it's just the system to blame. Yeah within 2 years 3 years 4 years why Time: 02:50 - 03:00 properties those three BHK same size same amenities same everything have become 6 crores from 1 and a2 crores what's gone up the way property rates Time: 03:00 - 03:10 have gone up especially in metros that we sitting in now the properties which were 6,000 7,000 rupees square ft today are touching 16 17,000 within a period Time: 03:10 - 03:20 of a year year and a half why what's happened such fast in such a small period of time. The banks are happy because they're giving loans. The Time: 03:20 - 03:30 government is happy because they're getting taxes out of it. So the whole industry is getting serviced with that. Right? End of the day, do you think the property today is worth it? What it is Time: 03:30 - 03:40 supposed to be? I say it's a completely inflated market. Here is your task. Your task is to go and ask your parents or your grandparents Time: 03:40 - 03:50 what was their earning and what was the cost of the house that they bought or the land that they bought. Basically take the cost of the home let's say it's 1 cr divided by their income yearly Time: 03:50 - 04:00 let's say 10 lakhs. So you'll get a ratio called 10x. This is the price to income ratio. So if you look at this and this chart over here shows the price to Time: 04:00 - 04:10 income ratio across Indian cities. Suppose you live in Gurugram. Buying a house in your own city has a ratio of just 2.77. That's affordable. But if you try to buy in Mumbai, the ratio jumps to Time: 04:10 - 04:20 7.46. Also, if you see Mumbai to Delhi all the way to Kolkata, this is the EMI to income ratio. So if your income is 100, Time: 04:20 - 04:30 116 someone is spending on just EMIs. That's crazy. And the lowest I can see over here is 41%. Even that's high. How Time: 04:30 - 04:40 can you spending 41% on your EMI? what will happen to emergencies and general expenses. But if you look at this, you'll see that EMI to income ratios range between 41% all the way to 116%. Time: 04:40 - 04:50 This means we're chasing a race and playing a game we just can't win. There's nobody going to come and talk Time: 04:50 - 05:00 about it altogether. Uh a lot of people ask you uh for black money. Well, all through their life want money in white. I have to pay something in black. Black Time: 05:00 - 05:10 money is interesting because both parties are incentivized and it's like a black hole. Someone who has black money wants to spend that black money where Time: 05:10 - 05:20 black money is accepted which is real estate in many many cases. So they want to actually use their undeclared income to buy a home. The seller also wants to Time: 05:20 - 05:30 do it because he doesn't get to pay tax. In both cases, the person who has black money is incentivized and so is the other party. And that's why it's a little tough to get rid of in NCR. I Time: 05:30 - 05:40 noticed it's an option. In tire two cities, it's a necessity. They always uh the registry cost is what Time: 05:40 - 05:50 they can save on right that comes when you are dealing in crows that counts to a big number now and if you are not ready to give it, it's a hurdle for you. Time: 05:50 - 06:00 Service class people like us, middle class people like us who has all through their life money in white have to pay something in black. Time: 06:00 - 06:10 So people who are earning a salary are actually paying an honesty premium because they're at a disadvantage Time: 06:20 - 06:30 because they are paying full taxes. They're paying extra money compared to people who are dishonest and didn't pay taxes. This is unfair and unfortunately I don't know what the solution to this Time: 06:30 - 06:40 is. Now apart from prices there's also something called the floor space index. It's by the government telling you how much you can actually construct. So an Time: 06:40 - 06:50 FSI of one means the same area of land you can have the same area of floor space. So the higher the FSI the taller Time: 06:50 - 07:00 the building. And obviously I have a chart over here to show this to you. You can see here that Singapore I can't even see what the number is but Tokyo is 20 Time: 07:00 - 07:10 but if you look at Tane it's one which is why you don't have a lot of skyscrapers there. So this begs the question, why doesn't the government just increase Time: 07:10 - 07:20 the FSI? So if we have taller buildings, we have more inventory, more houses, and therefore the prices will be lower. Right? That's what I thought until some Time: 07:20 - 07:30 people started debating that to have higher FSI, you need to have better infrastructure. So if you have more housing in say South Bombay, do you have Time: 07:30 - 07:40 enough roads, enough parking, enough facilities, enough sewage, enough water? All of that actually needs to make say make make sense and also the green space if too many people are living in an area Time: 07:40 - 07:50 is it even habitable how you can afford 50,000 rupees salary may an actual home so let's say you earn Time: 07:50 - 08:00 50,000 rupees a month and you plan to buy a 50 lak rupee home you've saved 5 lakhs which by the way is less down payment should ideally be 20% and you Time: 08:00 - 08:10 take loan at 9% interest your EMI comes to about 40,000 rupees. That's 80% of the monthly salary. Clearly not affordable. So, we have a two-point Time: 08:10 - 08:20 checklist. Unless you see tick marks in these check boxes, you probably can't afford that house yet. So, if you earn 50,000 rupees a month, your EMI Time: 08:20 - 08:30 shouldn't cross 20,000 rupees and you should have at least 10 lak rupees in savings for making the down payment. Now if you add stamp duty, maintenance, taxes, furnishing and interest, the Time: 08:30 - 08:40 actual cost of that 50 lak rupee home rises to about 1.2 cr rupees over 20 years. That's the financial truth. Now the emotional truth. See uh if you buy a Time: 08:40 - 08:50 house all your finances will go into one thing only. I mean whatever savings you Time: 08:50 - 09:00 have everything will go there. And in case there are challenges if you won't be able to sell it at a short notice with other investments you can make it. So always divide your investments. Don't Time: 09:00 - 09:10 keep all your eggs into one basket. Diversify yourself. I have made three principles in life. Number one never buy under construction property. If I ever Time: 09:10 - 09:20 ever again venture into market and buy a property it will be a ready to move in property. Two make sure all papers are Time: 09:20 - 09:30 correct. So when you buy a move in property, it will be registry day one. It will not be a carry forward future is bright 3 years down the line subvention plan. And three, never ever go by the Time: 09:30 - 09:40 name of the builder or the background of the builder. The bigger the name, the more chances of them growing up with you. When I was a kid, owning a house Time: 09:40 - 09:50 was a dream. Now when I have a house, paying the whole AMI is my dream. Buying that home and entering is a great moment. But all the moments in your last Time: 09:50 - 10:00 5 years if you write down that you remember were relationships with your friends, your parents, your family. You would also have trips you did, experiences you did, things you laughed Time: 10:00 - 10:10 on. Maybe you should curate those as well and not just a single asset that breaks your financial back.

01:10 ordering from outside I'm not saying change your life but cut out the extras and then do the most dramatic best thing you've ever done for yourself reduce Time: 01:10 - 01:20 your expenses by 1% and what you deduct from your expense will basically go into your savings it's pretty simple if you think about it so Time: 01:20 - 01:30 imagine your expenses are what 50,000 Rupees a month and 1% of that would be 500 rupees so basically I'm asking you to Skip One online food order it's not Time: 01:30 - 01:40 that difficult that 500 Rupees is invested let's say in some form of index fund that makes a 10 to 12% cagr that's over a period of time that money will Time: 01:40 -

02:10 you but you know all this money you can make from index funds and all is probably a lie no one told you this I'll Time: 02:10 - 02:20 be the first one to tell you investing is not as important as creating your own emergency fund you see all these people in office working buying a car all of Time: 02:20 - 02:30 that they don't have any savings which means that if they lose their job they won't last one Time: 02:30 - 02:40 month and no one really said this we talk about sips and people investing and then making money but dude the first step you can do for yourself is not investing is creating savings so that Time: 02:40 -

05:10 into your hard wirring without you even knowing it and you are actually following the crowd you're buying all the stuff you don't really need and the access to credit is so simple that you Time: 05:10 - 05:20 just have a lot of debt so a simple way to get out of this is called the debt to income ratio I have a calculator for you this is the world's simplest calculator Time: 05:20 - 05:30 but I promise you it'll change your life open up the calculator its job is to tell you how many days are you actually working for that credit that you have Time: 05:30 - 05:40 taken so you enter your income you enter all of the emis you're paying every single one of it and the calculator will do the rest it will tell you what percentage of your income is going Time: 05:40 - 05:50 towards emis remember when you're paying an Emi you don't own what you've bought the bank or the credit card company owns it you don't owe it yet it also owns Time: 05:50 - 06:00 another precious asset which is your time all that hard work you're putting on that project at work you're actually Time: 06:00 - 06:10 earning for someone else and not yourself anyway the debt to income ratio I read at a bunch of places and everyone said it should be below 36% if it's Time: 06:10 - 06:20 above 36% you're in the danger zone if it's below 36% you're in the safe Zone but you know what I think I think this number 36% was chosen because it sounds Time: 06:20 - 06:30 really smart it sounds oneir of your income and 36 sounds like a scientific number the truth is no one really knows how much debt is too much debt and I Time: 06:30 - 06:40 personally think you it shouldn't be more than 20% why do you want to buy stuff more than 1/5th of your salary but it's different for everyone and you can Time: 06:40 - 06:50 choose what this number is if you're scared to use this calculator I think even before you input the numbers you know that you probably have a little too Time: 06:50 - 07:00 much Emi and this is the most important Point actually come closer enough what you need to do is actually really simple Time: 07:00 - 07:10 and you already know it the magic is in actually doing it 1 2 3 the moment you take the first step you changed your Time: 07:10 - 07:20 life in an instant Time: 07:20 - 07:30My advice to all middle class family - stop eating outside food , very high prices, eat rarely with minimal ,stop online ordering , stop buying costly gadgets, don’t buy deprecation assets like costly cars etc save as much as possible don’t buy apartment beyond 75lakhs , if all middle class stay away from all this, all prices will come down drastically or else suffering will continue .",

      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:10 going to explain the blueprint to you. I call it blueprint 1A and blueprint 1B. And I'll also throw in my Google sheet that I actually use for my life today. Time: 00:10 - 00:20 And once you put all of this together, you might get to your first CR way faster. But you know what? Something happened last week. This is papa. Papa Time: 00:20 - 00:30 is iron man. 10,000 steps a day, eats well and when he calls me the only thing he says is beta gaja and I feel guilty and I don't go to meet him. He one day Time: 00:30 - 00:40 called me and said beta I fell down last night while going to the bathroom. I tripped. My shoulder is paining a lot. Of course we were a little worried. Then Time: 00:40 - 00:50 I thought it's nothing. It'll be fine. I mean and then his pain became worse. So we said okay we'll go to the doctor. The doctor said it's a full tear, you have Time: 00:50 - 01:00 to get surgery. And we got admitted to the hospital. Just one day, one surgery was 3.5 lakh rupees. And the 3 1/2 lakhs was taken care of by insurance. Now, Time: 01:00 - 01:10 Swati and I can actually manage a 3 4 5 6 lakh rupees sudden expense and we'll be fine. But if we were younger, this Time: 01:10 - 01:20 would have been a huge problem. So basically my point is medical insurance is non-negotiable. You have to take it for your family and yourself. End of story. No debate. Then Time: 01:20 - 01:30 on this Excel sheet, you'll find it in the description. You open and you put your monthly ka pani. Your rent, your expenses, your unexpected expenses. Time: 01:30 - 01:40 Let's say it's 30,000 rupees. This will be 1 lakh 80,000. This 1.8 lakhs is basically 6 months of air. If something Time: 01:40 - 01:50 happens, this will keep you safe. You can thank me later. But everything can't be done on an Excel, right? So, I want you to open your favorite note-taking Time: 01:50 - 02:00 app or a paper and pen like I like it and I want you to write this. Dear mommy, papa, I absolutely Time: 02:00 - 02:10 love you. And everything I do in this world, my work, my relationships, working hard, earning a salary is for you. If something happens to me, I have Time: 02:10 - 02:20 made sure that you are safe. Here is my plan mommy papa for the expenses of your health I have made sure I have x rupees Time: 02:20 - 02:30 saved for you in an insurance I know we have a loan of total 50 lakhs or other things and I have made sure that we have Time: 02:30 - 02:40 the money saved in case I'm not there you will be able to pay it and you will not be burdened by it with lots and lots of Time: 02:40 - 02:50 love. Did this scare you? If it did, there is a solution for this and it's called term insurance. It's something to make sure they are actually comfortable Time: 02:50 - 03:00 and safe. If you have a letter, do let me know what you wrote in the comments if it's not too personal. I'd love to know if this changed your life or not. Time: 03:00 - 03:10 But the point is very simple here, guys. This was our first step, your safety net. Now, let's move to step number two. Time: 03:10 - 03:20 You know, last year when we gave appraisals to people in the office, we were so so proud of ourselves. Actually, we just felt really good that people walked away with a decent appraisal and Time: 03:20 - 03:30 they had more money in the bank now. But then, like always, they completely fooled us. They started buying lot of clothes, expensive ones, went on trips. Time: 03:30 - 03:40 They even got a new car. The people who had cars upgrade those cars. Then people got nice shoes. And I'm like, at where did all this money come from? Time: 03:40 - 03:50 Thank you loan apps and easy credit. Point is a lot of people start investing with 500 rupees and that's great but it stays 500 for 5 Time: 03:50 - 04:00 years. No, the point of starting with 500 is that you begin the process and then you start to increase it as much as possible. This is a simple SIP Time: 04:00 - 04:10 calculator. On the right side we have SIP amount. Just look at that. Then we have some assumptions. Expected return Time: 04:10 - 04:20 10%. Because people in comments go 10% 12%. Then we have invested amount and market value. All you really need to see is this 20,000 when does it become a Time: 04:20 - 04:30 large amount? You can see over here that it takes 3 years and 6 months to add 10 lakhs to your account. The next 10 lakhs, so total 20 takes 2 years and 7 Time: 04:30 - 04:40 months. The next 10 lakhs takes 2 years and 1 month. Scroll down towards the end within 11 months you're adding 10 lakhs and even Time: 04:40 - 04:50 getting to a crudap comments what you'll say you'll say I don't have any money to invest I only have 500 rupees zumato can I have this nice dim sum over here okay Time: 04:50 - 05:00 I know what the problem is here's a simple hack if you really want to do this as soon as you get your salary look at that salary of that take a 5% or 10% Time: 05:00 - 05:10 whatever you want to invest and take that money out and invest it This doesn't really need to be stocks. And then what's left? That is where you do your ka. Usually you do the opposite. Time: 05:10 - 05:20 You call all these apps, make all these purchases and say, I'll also invest to make yourself feel good. Don't do that. And you know what this means? This means Time: 05:20 - 05:30 we have completed step two of our blueprint. And invest early and invest. I forgot the full form, but you get the point. In Time: 05:30 - 05:40 my early 20s, I started earning the magical figure of 1.5 lak rupees per month. I felt invincible. I mean, what Time: 05:40 - 05:50 is this? I earn a lot of money. And something even more interesting happened which I'll show you here. This was my income going up over a period of time. Time: 05:50 - 06:00 And then something interesting happened. This was my expense. And basically the difference here was my savings. But then when I suddenly thought that I deserved Time: 06:00 - 06:10 more, this happened and I suddenly started spending more than I could afford. You know what this is called? Economists and some Time: 06:10 - 06:20 really good noble audience call this unhappiness. also [Music] Time: 06:20 - 06:30 called whenever you try to spend to signal to the outside world that you have reached some sort of status is the fastest way to become poor. But what's Time: 06:30 - 06:40 the solution? The solution is the creation of a guiltfree fund. The first x% should go for investments. Then the next for all your fixed expenses and Time: 06:40 - 06:50 expected expenses. Then whatever's left is your guilt-free fund. This means everything we've covered so far is lifestyle inflation which is step three Time: 06:50 - 07:00 of our entire journey at the blueprint. And step number four starts with Romesh and Sur. They both love five-star but Time: 07:00 - 07:10 they also love something else. Both of them have an SIP but Romesh has credit card debt, personal loan and he may also have Time: 07:10 - 07:20 BNP . Suresh has none of these things. Let's assume they're investing in say Nifty. It'll be between 10% to Time: 07:20 - 07:30 12%. Growth and that's growth. But over here the debt bit, this bit is actually Time: 07:30 - 07:40 anti-compounding for you at 36 to 48%. So whatever is the highest loan category with the most interest, pay that off first. Once that is done, then do SIP . Time: 07:40 - 07:50 This means step number four is actually complete, which is the loan trap. But the most important part of this entire blueprint is right here. And if you're Time: 07:50 - 08:00 wondering what this is, this is basically the compounding blueprint, the safety net, the invest E square. And this Time: 08:00 - 08:10 is the anti-compounding blueprint which covers lifestyle inflation loan trap and the most important thing of all that's Time: 08:10 - 08:20 something I keep looking at even today and you should too. It took me 20 years to figure this framework out. It's called the DBL framework. And let me Time: 08:20 - 08:30 explain it to you a little aram. Two years ago, I decided that I had to learn to play the guitar. And to learn to play Time: 08:30 - 08:40 the guitar was incredibly tough because I had to go back home, get my instructor, and he would spend countless hours with me just learning. And this Time: 08:40 - 08:50 was 2 hours every day for 2 years. All that sacrifice and these fingers over here will actually show you something interesting and how this will Time: 08:50 - 09:00 change your life in the DBL framework. 1 2 [Music] Time: 09:00 - 09:10 3 I only dreamed it and I made a blueprint for playing my music. But that Time: 09:10 - 09:20 instructor never came. I never called him, never negotiated, never studied for 2 hours, never practiced. And this was a waste. Just like you. I've been educating for a decade now. And I Time: 09:20 - 09:30 realize all these frameworks are great, but you won't listen. You won't actually do it. The don't be lazy framework is exactly this. If you don't do it today, Time: 09:30 - 09:40 your investments will sound exactly like my music. Time: 09:40 - 09:50 [Applause] Time: 09:50 - 10:00Videos are getting repetitive now :/",

      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:10 these posts over here wow so much Moola today we will actually create the portfolio to prove that this can be done Time: 00:10 - 00:20 but in true de influencing style we'll actually talk about the risks involved in actually doing this because these guys they don't talk about it so first we'll create a portfolio second we'll Time: 00:20 - 00:30 find out what number we need to get to 50,000 Rupees a month passively and third we'll talk about all the risks involved but before we actually do that Time: 00:30 - 00:40 hit that like and that subscribe button because I need your like I need that subscribe so let's start with step number Time: 00:40 - 00:50 [Music] one so let's start right from the Time: 00:50 - 01:00 Basics what's a dividend let's go back to the 1600s where the Dutch East India Company For The First Time in the World Went public which meant the arm admy or Time: 01:00 - 01:10 well the Royals and the rich people could invest and get shares now this company is very special they would go around the world in ships risking their Time: 01:10 - 01:20 lives to get back spices and spices made a lot of profit now obviously the investors put in money to make these voyages possible so to actually make an Time: 01:20 - 01:30 exit or give some return on these Investments the answer was simple take the profits and redistribute a part of them to the investors that's called a Time: 01:30 - 01:40 dividend even today all these companies over here give dividend from their profits not all of it a part of their profits the first thing we need to know Time: 01:40 - 01:50 is what kind of company can actually pay a dividend obviously a profitable company otherwise they'll have no money to give back but do note sometimes non profitable companies may also pay a Time: 01:50 - 02:00 dividend since they have a robust cash Reserve so the metric we need to look at is R oce now I won't get too much into the details of this basically it's a Time: 02:00 - 02:10 measure to understand what percentage of profit is the company able to make with respect to the total Capital employed by the company for example a capital Time: 02:10 - 02:20 employed of 1 CR you don't want them to be making one rupe profit you probably want them to make 10% or 10 lakh Rupees profit so it not only tells you profitability it also Al tells you Time: 02:20 - 02:30 efficiency whether it's good or not the RSC metric we need to qualify for our portfolio is 10% or greater so this is something we absolutely need can't be below this the second metric is EPS EPS Time: 02:30 - 02:40 or earnings now there are multiple ways to look at this but basically we want earnings to be going up the only way earnings can be going up over five or Time: 02:40 - 02:50 six year period is if the company is doing very well and also the market is also growing the industry is also growing so second thing we need is EPS Time: 02:50 - 03:00 actually growing that's our second metric for our screener the third metric is going to be dividend yield now I am damn sure you would have seen a paper like this saying do so% Dividend does Time: 03:00 - 03:10 that mean if you put in 1 lakh rupees 2 lakh rupees will come back absolutely not just like most things in finance Time: 03:10 - 03:20 things have a let me explain moment so over here it's very simple the 200% dividend declared that you see on newspapers or the internet is on the face value which is 2 4 or 5 rupees Time: 03:20 - 03:30 which doesn't make a big difference to you what matters to you is how much money did you put in and how much dividend are you getting on the capital Time: 03:30 - 03:40 you have invested dividend yield does exactly that it takes the dividend amount divides it by the current market price to give you a percentage in the market Time: 03:40 - 03:50 any dividend yield above 2% is wow amazing ma now why is the 2% or greater dividend considered amazing because the Time: 03:50 - 04:00 company's job is not to give you a source of passive income or a source of income where it's giving you part of the profits its job is to actually grow the Time: 04:00 - 04:10 company the growth happens and hopefully the share price also appreciates so this capital appreciation a company's job is Time: 04:10 - 04:20 not to give dividend if it does great thanks but that's not why it primarily exists anyway let's move on to make this screener I have all these three metrics Time: 04:20 - 04:30 and I'll open it up over here run it and hit done I've also marked this as I've also sorted it as per market cap we've also add market cap greater than 10,000 Time: 04:30 - 04:40 crores which makes this greater than a billion dollar so the largest companies come first followed by the least smallest companies below that now you'll Time: 04:40 - 04:50 see a new uh column over here called dividend yield look at that that's the dividend yield that's amazing right and some companies like Co India Etc have Time: 04:50 - 05:00 really large dividend yields sounds tasty but here is the problem let's suppose you make the portfolio out of this of say 15 or 20 stocks your average dividend yield will come to 4% or 5% now Time: 05:00 - 05:10 to actually make 50,000 rupes a month or 6 lakh rupees a year you will have to have a capital of 1.5 crores now most of Time: 05:10 - 05:20 us don't have that kind of capital so if anyone tells you you can do XYZ to make passive income from the market they are Time: 05:20 - 05:30 lying it's not true it is false the second problem is since the job of the company is not to give you a dividend but to actually grow the business it one Time: 05:30 - 05:40 day may decide it doesn't want to give the dividend so even if you have that 1.5 crores and even if you create that portfolio there's no sort of guarantee where they have to give that dividend Time: 05:40 - 05:50 it's their choice it's their way of rewarding their investors and for some reason they may choose just not to do it one day the third problem is the Time: 05:50 - 06:00 dividend yield itself now if you take a look at say ITC when the price of the stock was lower its yield was a beautiful 6% then the stock Rose and the Time: 06:00 - 06:10 yield is now around 2 3% what does this mean does it make ITC a Bad Company not at all actually it has nothing to do with the company it just has to do with Time: 06:10 - 06:20 your perspective of trying to make a passive income that's not how an investor should think an investor should think he thinks these 15 20 30 companies are amazing and you should try to hold Time: 06:20 - 06:30 them for as long as possible even better yet try to hold an index fund nifty50 stocks and hold them for as long as possible creating a portfolio to create Time: 06:30 - 06:40 a passive income out of especially stocks just doesn't work you should throw this mindset away another red flag Time: 06:40 - 06:50 and might I say the largest biggest red flag is capital erosion if you pick a stock because the dividend yield seems attractive but the company itself isn't Time: 06:50 - 07:00 good the business isn't good then the stock price could fall significantly let's say the stock price falls 30 40 50% suddenly that 2 or 3% dividend yield Time: 07:00 - 07:10 won't mean much so here's the mindset of how you should think about this one Stock Investing is a long-term game for capital appreciation not dividends two Time: 07:10 - 07:20 identify what kind of investor are you you're either picking stocks of your own creating your own portfolio or just simply inv investing in an index fund Time: 07:20 - 07:30 number three if you do this for a really long time you might just get a little lucky and some of the stocks you bought not for dividends do pay out a dividend Time: 07:30 - 07:40 and because your portfolio becomes large and you did this for decades the dividend payout will be nice then you can probably make a real about it and the cycle can start all over again for example Warren Baba over here makes Time: 07:40 - 07:50 billions of dollars just from dividend but he didn't buy those companies for the dividend he bought it because the business was good so you should also Time: 07:50 - 08:00 think the same we've been thinking of creating this series for a while now and we wanted to start with this de influencing Series where we basically try to Target the greedy people in the Time: 08:00 - 08:10 market explain them and tease them with the greed talk about how it's possible and then explain all the risks all of it so if you miss some Risk please put it Time: 08:10 - 08:20 in the comments below and once you the user understand the greed and the risk part hopefully you'll make the right Time: 08:20 - 08:30 decision [Music] hopefully if you think this is interesting and we should continue this series please tell us what other things Time: 08:30 - 08:40 we should include in the de influencing series put it in the comments below and we'll come up with a bunch more every single week if you enjoyed this hit that Time: 08:40 -

00:30 many many years the difference is now the subscription has grown from the physical space to the digital space and here is what we found something interesting it's about a new company Time: 00:30 - 00:40 which taught us a new way to pay for a service Salesforce Salesforce was selling software before it people would Time: 00:40 - 00:50 basically buy the software and own the freaking software Salesforce changed this they had a pay as you go model for any Enterprises and they renamed it to Time: 00:50 - 01:00 software as a service SAS since the Salesforce explosion businesses and subscription models have been in sort of Time: 01:00 - 01:10 like a love affair more and more business categories are actually exploring subscription Services as a business model and the math is mathing in 2020 the subscription economy was Time: 01:10 - 01:20 worth 650 billion and in 2025 it's expected to be around 1.5 trillion these businesses Time: 01:20 - 01:30 know how to give you free trials hop on their ride and the most famous OG trick make you feel special special is ironic because more Time: 01:30 - 01:40 and more people are moving towards subscriptions and they're actually just a statistic so over here what we found was interesting you can see here in Time: 01:40 - 01:50 every single category you have people interested in subscription like clothing and fashion you can also see household groceries Time: 01:50 - 02:00 and the cost of subscriptions per month for say e-learning is 700 rupees gaming is 550 Wellness is 553 even Music Services command 400 rupees a month but Time: 02:00 - 02:10 what happens when the subscription traps innocent people in the name of convenience imagine spending thousands of rupees on a printer on the ink Time: 02:10 - 02:20 cartridges on the electricity and then you can't use the printer and the reason it's not printing says payment method Time: 02:20 - 02:30 needs updating my partner I got a new printer and it just wouldn't print at all cannot print with the installed cartridge the ink is completely full I replaced it like last week this is a real story about an actual HB printer Time: 02:30 - 02:40 user he's not allowed to use a third party ink cartridge and has to use the expensive ones sold by the company if the ink is low then you can't use facts Time: 02:40 - 02:50 or scanning which has nothing to do with ink and the worst part is if you cancel the ink cartridge subscript description Time: 02:50 - 03:00 the entire printer becomes unusable why our goal was to reduce the number of what we call unprofitable customers that makes actual no sense and Time: 03:00 - 03:10 it's not just your printer it's other products too like a fitness band which costs 25 26,000 Rupees allows you to use its product for a full year after which Time: 03:10 - 03:20 you've got to buy a subscription to use the exact same product but now you're paying for the Analytics and everything Time: 03:20 - 03:30 else because all your data is there it's basically selling your data back to you and the one car companies use are even funnier no I really mean it so in the UK Time: 03:30 - 03:40 it's really cold obviously it's a cold country so people want heated seats a person who's bought a BMW car and owns that car actually has to pay a Time: 03:40 - 03:50 subscription for heated seats and Toyota even introduced a subscription for key fobs for a remote start there's even a case where Mercedes is charging a Time: 03:50 - 04:00 subscription fee for faster acceleration guys someone's bought the product why you putting stuff like this behind a paywall but you know the crazy bit when you actually own it and you have to pay Time: 04:00 - 04:10 a little bit more you sort of do end up paying a little bit more and then some companies give you free access to their product with a free trial now you'll say Time: 04:10 - 04:20 there's nothing wrong with a free trial and that isn't but wait till I tell you a story I remember a time when you would go Time: 04:20 - 04:30 online sign up for a trial and if you didn't like it you just abandoned it and nothing would happen but not now now they'll take your credit card and you'll Time: 04:30 - 04:40 forget about the credit card because the trial period is just long enough and if you forget to cancel they'll freaking charge you has it ever happened to you you forgot about canceling your Time: 04:40 - 04:50 subscription and you were charged so let's talk about Spotify Spotify is one of those apps which is used for Passive usage which means you'll do it while you're running cooking you're driving Time: 04:50 - 05:00 basically you're not actively using the app now the great thing about a passive app is that you do it with your existing habits so if you go to the gym in the morning you might get used to using the Time: 05:00 - 05:10 Spotify playlist during your gym or maybe when you're driving home or some part of your habits Spotify knows this so it's given a 3mon long trial with all Time: 05:10 - 05:20 of its capabilities you start to use it and after the 3 months they withraw those exact same features which was making your life amazing and now you got Time: 05:20 - 05:30 to pay for it even if it's a low amount in India users can't play songs in a specific order repeat songs or tab back to their previous songs and these Time: 05:30 - 05:40 features will instead only be available to premium subscribers I think it's a great app but it's a little sneaky trick a lot of companies are using at a couple of bucks a day it's not a lot but now Time: 05:40 - 05:50 you're addicted and you got to pay the subscription forever let's take OT for an example and here we can see Time: 05:50 - 06:00 India's growth on OT is out running the average this is enabled by the internet and UPI and sustained with a little thing called UPI autopay like if I open Time: 06:00 - 06:10 my phone right now I can check that my Netflix autopay on UPI set to Time: 06:10 - 06:20 2053 it means that till 2053 Netflix can continue to withdraw from my account its amount if I don't hit the cancel button Time: 06:20 - 06:30 how convenient for them and you know what's interesting it's affecting people in a deep scarring way you you come here come here come here come here lambu this is lambu Amar he looks after sound he's Time: 06:30 - 06:40 getting engaged next year and his auto pay just renewed Time: 06:40 - 06:50 Tinder so what's basically Happening Here is that they're trying to take a maximum amount from the user Time: 06:50 - 07:00 without any additional services that they're giving to them and the problem here is not even that it's actually that your choice is being taken away from you as a consumer in a capitalist Society Time: 07:00 - 07:10 according to Adam Smith the most important power each one of us have is that we get to vote which company wins and which loses with the choices that we Time: 07:10 - 07:20 make from the products that we choose to buy but if that choice is taken away from us it's no longer Fair like the bundling issue sometimes you've bought a Time: 07:20 - 07:30 certain service and they give you a bunch of free services as well which are also subscriptions signed you up and sometime in the future it may Auto renew Time: 07:30 - 07:40 they're taking away your choice then there's the case of overlapping Services you may buy 1 2 3 four Music Services because you forgot the other one is automatically Auto renewing especially Time: 07:40 - 07:50 if the amount is really really low I know sometimes 100 rupes may not matter to someone but why would you pay for something you're not actually using and Time: 07:50 - 08:00 this is why people are sick and tired of subscriptions like covered in this article beautifully and I'd love to show you this article but I can't because this article is behind a freaking pay Time: 08:00 - 08:10 wall and you need a subscription it's so weird it's made it to Reddit where people are talking about this it's kind of crazy but the best Time: 08:10 - 08:20 thing about a subscription business is that you can opt out press the cancel button exit leave and I found something crazy that blow your Time: 08:20 - 08:30 mind when you want to cancel it's bad for the business maybe it's what you want but not what the business wants I want you to see this example of adore me Time: 08:30 - 08:40 when a customer would go to buy something over there normally to shop just once they would automatically convert that customer into a Time: 08:40 - 08:50 subscription paying customer without their consent so even if they didn't buy anything the next month they would still pay a subscription amount that's crazy Time: 08:50 - 09:00 and once they found out and had to cancel it they would show weird things like store credits and deter you from actually cancelling you see the subscription model is absolutely fine Time: 09:00 - 09:10 but these dark patterns is taking away a choice and definitely is deceitful the root of all of this is convenience UPI autopay is making things easier for Time: 09:10 - 09:20 these guys meanwhile we are writing an entire thesis on cancellation flows I'm not kidding check this out Time: 09:20 - 09:30 it's called The Iliad flow and the flow basically talks about how you have to go through multiple dock patterns screens to actually just cancel in fact in an Time: 09:30 - 09:40 Amazon Prime cancellation flow you have to go through three different screens to actually cancel and in all these screens there are 70 dark patterns we actually Time: 09:40 - 09:50 counted it and this research paper even dissected every single page of course they have to protect their business but why make it so hard for you to Time: 09:50 - 10:00 cancel and some companies won't even let you cancel after this making it even harder saying send us an email and someone will call you or speak with you Time: 10:00 - 10:10 before you can actually cancel back in the day we used to do this with gym memberships they used to take a whole Year's worth of money and then they just didn't let you cancel like this crazy Hotel Collection diffuser proudly on its Time: 10:10 - 10:20 FAQ page says you're not allowed to cancel the average cancellation flow anywhere on the internet has about 6.2 Time: 10:20 - 10:30 dark patterns including cute pandas and puppies then we looked through the internet to find a tool that can find all of our subscriptions so we can easily cancel them and we did this magic Time: 10:30 - 10:40 tool also has a subscription so we can cancel other subscriptions oh my God what is wrong with you internet now Time: 10:40 - 10:50 there are some fixes the government is trying to bring new regulations to actually fix all these things like Merchants must disclose all these Norms before the autopay is happening and even Time: 10:50 - 11:00 in India there was an autopay reset just a while back and I'm sure in time we'll find a solution 20 years ago when you bought something you actually owned it Time: 11:00 - 11:10 today because you want unlimited songs unlimited movies unlimited everything you pay for a subscription and you end up owning nothing the question is do you Time: 11:10 - 11:20 really own it or does the subscription own you Time: 11:20 - 11:30And that's why many people put on their pirate hats and sail the seas...

      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:10 MBA really worth it. In 2025, to understand this better we spoke to real people. So my name is Ujjwal. Time: 00:10 - 00:20 So I'm Henna. I'm Shivani. I'm Astha My name is Vibhor. Who actually completed an MBA in what happened a few years after. We also looked at the data to answer all of these questions and I was amazed. Time: 00:20 - 00:30 You know the MBA is the most sought after master degree not only in India but in America as well. Time: 00:30 - 00:40 Like in India, we have 3 lakh people applying for the common admission test. Time: 00:40 - 00:50 The major reason why people get into MBAs Time: 01:00 - 01:10 Just like Vibhor, Ujjwal and Astha. They actually want a better salary package. According to this IIT Roorkee study. This is why people want to do it. Time: 01:10 - 01:20 And out of the 3 lakh people only 5,000 will actually get into the top institute. And I'm referring to an IIM over here. Time: 01:20 - 01:30 The MBA craze is not unique. Every single industry goes through an expansion and a contraction. And MBA is going through exactly the same thing. We had the craze of the BA degree. Time: 01:30 - 01:40 Yes, Bachelor of Arts. Over here we can see that about 50 lakh people were enrolled in a BA in 1990-91. Time: 01:40 - 01:50 But in 2020-2021 it was 4 crores. Because people thought this is the basic degree. You need to get into a government job or any job. Time: 01:50 - 02:00 So everyone took the BA degree. The same thing happened with engineering. We saw it with pilots. We see it in small industries. We saw it with product managers. We see it time and time again. Time: 02:00 - 02:10 But the difference is that MBA comes with a hefty price. Fees that I paid I think it was 24 lakhs if I'm not wrong. Time: 02:10 - 02:20 And then major part of the batch will take a loan. So did I. But wait. It's not just IIMs that can charge a hefty amount. Time: 02:20 - 02:30 It's other private colleges too. When I picked up the institute and the fees was 12 lakh something that time. 2009. Time: 02:30 - 02:40 But while you're doing this, there are other costs as well. Your travel cost, your hostel fees, your food, everything. Time: 02:50 - 03:00 You have your general expenses that you will do around the month. So when you take a loan, you basically take a loan for 30 or 32 lakhs. And usually you will look at how much you can earn by looking at a placement report and figure out the roi. Time: 03:10 - 03:20 But there are two invisible costs you're probably not thinking about. The first one is the interest cost. Time: 03:20 - 03:30 This is the most simplest to understand. If you're taking a loan of 20 lakh rupees over a period of seven to eight years, you'll probably end up paying 28 to 30 lakh rupees. The second cost is the opportunity cost. Time: 03:30 - 03:40 Now this one creates a little bit of anxiety. If you are doing an MBA for two years and you're not earning and let's say your salary before the MBA was say 7 lakh rupees, Time: 03:40 - 03:50 you have lost 7+7, 14 lakh rupees and maybe an appraisal of 10% somewhere in between in these two years in exchange to earn that MBA. Time: 03:50 - 04:00 But of course you're paying such a hefty amount, you'll get some value out of it, right? Time: 04:00 - 04:10 Maybe in the form of placements and how much your first salary can be after you're out of the college. I got placed into RP Sanjeev Goenka Group. I got a stipend of not sure, but about 1.3 or 1.4 lakh per month. Time: 04:10 - 04:20 So that was the stipend that. But if I have to think about averages that would range around Rs. 80,000 to 1 lakh. Time: 04:20 - 04:30 So I'm assuming that that would have been risen to about 1.3 to 1.5 lakhs right now as an average, the job offer I got from College was about 21 LPA. Time: 04:30 - 04:40 So yeah, I think you can expect about that range in terms of salary packages. Time: 04:40 - 04:50 Highest would range up to 70, 80 lakhs, lowest would be about 12, 12, 13 LPA is what I would think about. Time: 04:50 - 05:00 Okay, so it seems like the ROI with top colleges seems to be good. But what about the other colleges, the not so famous ones, the new ones, the private ones, the ones you probably haven't heard of but still charge lakhs of rupees. Time: 05:00 - 05:10 They highlight that we give 100% placement. And what do you mean by 100% placement? Maybe somebody is getting placed on 4 lakh or 5 lakh package. That is nothing. Time: 05:30 - 05:40 You know the fees you have paid, it's not worth it. Time: 05:40 - 05:50 There are so many mid tier and low tier colleges in the country. With the 'MBA' title, they sell you you a dream. Time: 06:00 - 06:10 I don't think that most institutes provide the value that they charge for. Even now when someone asks me recommendations for an MBA college, I highly recommend that don't Time: 06:30 - 06:40 pursue an MBA if you're not getting into the top 20 colleges in the country. After that it's like, for lack of a better word, garbage. Time: 06:40 - 06:50 Like now your impressions of what the placements are may be different but the fact is if you have an MBA tag from a top tier college, recruiters do notice. Time: 06:50 - 07:00 I know in office when we are looking to hire someone and someone has a tag of IIM or XLRI etc. We take a little more effort to read who they are, what they've done. Time: 07:00 - 07:10 And I've also noticed their communication skills are better than a lot of other people. It is a good filter. There is no doubt about it. The curriculum is so smartly designed that you will learn so many things while playing. Time: 07:10 - 07:20 As in there will be a lot of competitions or lot of activities designed for people to innate leadership skills Time: 07:20 - 07:30 to get in a group, how to work in a group. So these things will be taught with curriculum and not just by theory. Time: 07:30 - 07:40 Now cut to you enter the MBA institute. Time: 07:40 - 07:50 But it's not just the interpersonal skills you develop during mba. I mean it's also about the connects with your strong alumni network. I mean it gives you access to valuable relationships and opportunities and that probably does shape your career, doesn't it? Time: 08:00 - 08:10 I could visit anywhere right now in India. We have a group of all IIM Calcutta alumni. Time: 08:10 - 08:20 I can ask around anything to anyone. I went to Lucknow, I had a problem. My parents were in Lucknow. I needed a doctor to be searched for. I posted in that group. Time: 08:20 - 08:30 Is there someone who I can get in touch with? Quickly I got 2-3 messages about doctors in Lucknow who they could consult on. How can you put in value to that? Time: 08:30 - 08:40 A friend of mine used to say this a lot And it is very very true. Time: 08:40 - 08:50 It is for the network than it is for the salary packages. I won't say skills. Time: 08:50 - 09:00 So the big question remains, is MBA really worth it in today's time. Till date it does give credibility. It gives an edge to other profiles. Time: 09:50 - 10:00 But provided it's done from a good institute, the network or the kind of exposure that you're talking about that you'll get in those places will be very good. Time: 10:00 - 10:10 So it comes down to two things. First, do you really have some skill that you can polish and become really valuable in the world? Time: 10:20 - 10:30 Because it seems like the world is moving from degree based recognition to skill based recognition. Second, do you think that the MBA will make you special? Time: 10:30 - 10:40 This is a really important question. Just going there does not give you any skills. You can be there, do nothing for two years and still come out and you will be a graduate of ABC College. Time: 10:40 - 10:50 So if you think you are learning something every week you have an edge and the MBA just adds to it, then maybe you should do the mba. But if you think the only thing in your life defining your career is the mba, probably it won't really help. Time: 11:20 - 11:30 The three Idiots how the movie has actually been framed is very very correct. Time: 11:30 - 11:40 Run after excellence, exposure, learning and ultimately success or packages will get to you. Time: 11:40 - 11:50MBA has been a lifesaver for me. I lost many years in UPSC preparation. Pursuing an MBA from IIM gave me a second life.",

05:00 per month in the stock market and increase it by just 10% every year start now these reals are actually really popular because it's a small amount of Time: 05:00 - 05:10 money over here and a large amount of money over there and it feels magical now my guess is the influencers do this to illustrate the power of compounding and I think they are totally right what Time: 05:10 - 05:20 a great example the problem happens when the viewer thinks that this is real and this is the best way now there are two problems over here the first first Time: 05:20 - 05:30 problem is this the 1 number if you think about it over a few decades that one will be worth less than what it's today because of because of you know Time: 05:30 - 05:40 impation B say so what I'll do is I'll also add inflation and adjust this 1 CR to 2024 and once I adjust it tell me guys Time: 05:40 - 05:50 in the background how much is it worth 50 LH nope any other guest 25 LH so this 1 CR number after 36 years is worth Time: 05:50 - 06:00 roughly 17 lakh rupees when you adjust it for inflation so you can't retire on it so then why are you doing it coming Time: 06:00 - 06:10 to the second point of this story so we've established 500 Rupees is not enough what's a good number 5,000 6,000 what do you guys think take 10,000 but Time: 06:10 - 06:20 I'm adding 10% every year so we increase it by 10% every year this 10,000 per month contribution actually becomes 1 Time: 06:20 - 06:30 lakh rupees per month contribution after 25 years now my first question is how much am I actually earning in salary to Time: 06:30 - 06:40 be able to afford this 1 lakh rupees per month investment so what I did was I assume the salary is 20,000 I know no one invests 10,000 out of 20 but let's Time: 06:40 - 06:50 assume the salary is 20,000 because it's a common number and let's assume that over a period of time average you're growing at 8% increment a year this Time: 06:50 - 07:00 20,000 salary becomes 1.3 lakh rupees per month in 25 years that's not a lot because 1.3 lakh rupees me say 1 lakh Time: 07:00 - 07:10 you have to spend sorry invest in the market so what's the problem here you might get married you might have kids you might have to stay back to take care of the kids and that is life it's really Time: 07:10 - 07:20 unpredictable you may not be able to do it on the flip side you may have great events also there may be bonus there may be ESO buyback there may be something that happens that gives you that extra Time: 07:20 - 07:30 cash and then you can well use that money your mindset should be you may not be able to do a 10% every year but where you can you should invest it so if you Time: 07:30 - 07:40 get a bonus try not to spend all of it take some of it and invest it and like that over a period of time it may average as a 10% increase so this Time: 07:40 - 07:50 imaginary number you have of 50 crores in X number of years or 100 cores in X number of years may not happen because life gets in the way but isn't the Time: 07:50 - 08:00 purpose of accumulating wealth life itself don't be like me when I was young all I did was looked at the future into my Excel sheet and think when I turn X Time: 08:00 - 08:10 age I will start enjoying life but life just went by your job is to find the Beautiful Moments every single day and Time: 08:10 - 08:20 if a bonus comes along celebrate it a little more Point number three let me tell you a secret Time: 08:20 - 08:30 compounding by power of compounding that's actually crazy 7.8 crores from 2001 to now that's actually a lot but Time: 08:30 - 08:40 here's the problem you won't have the memories of yourself on that bike enjoying going through the valley with your friends and enjoying that beautiful Time: 08:40 - 08:50 air because youngness will not come back and wrinkles are real and so is white hair can you please enjoy your life and also Jennifer Lopez Time: 08:50 - 09:00 I would have a house today and a mansion in LA guys there is no way for us to go back in time and do stuff that did really well did any of you think Nvidia would go up so much because then AI race Time: 09:00 - 09:10 would happen no one can predict the future so when the influencers talk about a stock going up so much in infosis going up so much all they're Time: 09:10 - 09:20 really trying to do is tell you the power of compounding and the power of investing over a long period bus so the problem about this kind of story is that Time: 09:20 - 09:30 it's for more inducing you think I don't even need 78 crores so how can I get closer and when you go through all of this you think what is an example of something like Time: 09:30 - 09:40 this happening today and you might think Ola electric Ola electric might be like aisher and I might make 78 crores in the future this is wrong you analyze Ola Time: 09:40 - 09:50 electric independently it's management fundamental analysis future industry etc etc then you take risk of investing in Time: 09:50 - 10:00 it as a investor but you cannot compare these two just because Aisha did it doesn't mean any other company will do it and this is true across the industry across the world on anything that you do Time: 10:00 - 10:10 these are two different situations and finally people talk about creating a portfolio which gives you dividends and you'll be able to make x Time: 10:10 - 10:20 amount of money per month and I'm going to tell you how you can make 50,000 Rupees every single month just just by creating a dividend portfolio so watch Time: 10:20 - 10:30 this video to learn how you can earn 50,000 Rupees in passive dividend income if you write in the comments an interesting influencer thing that you Time: 10:30 - 10:40 saw that is hilarious the three top comments that get the most engagement the most likes and is actually genuinely good we feature you on the 01 community on the Instagram account put it up see Time: 10:40 -

      "duration": "PT0S",
      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:10 parents gifted him a brand new phone when he was in class 10. Back then, social media was um Time: 00:10 - 00:20 social. So, he went on the best app that was possible, Facebook. added all of his friends, poked them, found out what they're doing, commented, liked, did Time: 00:20 - 00:30 everything all of us did on Facebook, and actually interacted with his friends until one day he got a notification. Time: 00:30 - 00:40 Diva tagged him on a photo and he was finally cool in his own eyes. When Diva tagged him in that photo, that was the best Time: 00:40 - 00:50 high he had ever experienced. and he wanted more and more and a little bit more. Time: 00:50 - 01:00 [Music] Facebook was so popular in India that it was actually the second largest market for Facebook with 10 cr users. They Time: 01:00 - 01:10 actually cracked the Indian market and then Instagram happened. This was a breath of Time: 01:10 - 01:20 fresh air. all those pictures. It looked beautiful. I mean, look at that scroll. And the best thing was Karan's parents weren't on it. Instagram launched reals Time: 01:20 - 01:30 and this changed everything. You see, humans are pleasure seeking creatures Time: 01:30 - 01:40 and they want a way to satiate their pleasure. So, they have to have a desire and they go out and find a way to actually complete it. But the brain and the body isn't designed for that kind of Time: 01:40 - 01:50 reward every single day. But social media seriously messes up the brain and you become Time: 01:50 - 02:00 addicted. The interesting thing about reals is that it creates a social bubble. You can see here Karan was Time: 02:00 - 02:10 dating this girl and all he saw on his social feed was relationships, dating and how love makes life beautiful. But suddenly one day he broke up with her Time: 02:10 - 02:20 and all he sees on that feed is toxic relationships, self-help, how you should be solo, how you should enjoy your life Time: 02:20 - 02:30 and not be dependent on anyone. But why and how has this happened? Here is why. Because apps track Time: 02:30 - 02:40 everything. These are some popular apps and everything that they track. Purchases, location, contacts, user content, search history, browsing history, usage data of Time: 02:40 - 02:50 their internet, financial information, etc. But out of the thousand possibilities, let's look at one SMS. Just with this, imagine how much Time: 02:50 - 03:00 information you can get. You can get all the purchase history, location, where they're going, and you can sum this up to actually create a persona of what this person is. They know more about you Time: 03:00 - 03:10 than you know you cuz [Music] Time: 03:10 - 03:20 [Applause] you can see from this report right here that the company's behavioral advertising business, which is its main business, I can see here out of the Time: 03:20 - 03:30 $55.8 $8 billion it earned 55 billion came from ads. So if they have to monetize your free time they have to do something a little more sinister human Time: 03:30 - 03:40 psychology. In fact this is how Karan ended up here in the first place. But I'll tell you that a little bit later. Since you've been watching this video a notification Time: 03:40 - 03:50 is played five times and you probably didn't even notice it. And I'm sure at least once you would have checked your phone and then thought notification or Time: 03:50 - 04:00 you would have paused this video because you had to check that important message. And this is the first way an app exploits your psychology. The notification. If an app wants your Time: 04:00 - 04:10 attention, they should have a custom notification sound. But actually they don't. They use the default one that comes with the phone. Time: 04:10 - 04:20 [Music] And the reason is so it blends in with all the important notifications. Trust me that notification is not urgent but Time: 04:20 - 04:30 because it blends in with SMS and all the other important notifications you feel like checking and once you check you get something called the variable Time: 04:30 - 04:40 reward and because of that you crave that dopamine hit again. Now, since the social media apps know what is triggering those dopamine hits, they Time: 04:40 - 04:50 send you these notifications at random times, the next hack I call the red danger zone hack. You see, humans perceive the color red Time: 04:50 - 05:00 to be danger. That's why every single notification has a red dot saying this is important. I need your attention. On the other hand, if your family goes to a wedding and they give a red lifa with Time: 05:00 - 05:10 the money, the shagun, then you know that next time when they come to your family event, they have probably kept a track of how much shagun you had given. Time: 05:10 - 05:20 And I'm sure your parents or someone elder actually keeps a track of this and tries to reciprocate it the next time they go to their event. This is called social reciprocity. And the same thing Time: 05:20 - 05:30 is true on social media apps too. When you see 12 unread messages on WhatsApp, you feel like replying to it ASAP . Time: 05:30 - 05:40 [Music] The next hack is called loss aversion. Think of it like this. The psychological pain of losing something has almost Time: 05:40 - 05:50 twice more value than something that you can gain of about equal importance. By snap Time: 05:50 - 06:00 [Music] Minute wait. [Music] Time: 06:00 - 06:10 He panicked because his friend didn't Time: 06:10 - 06:20 send him a photo and he would break a streak. To be honest, what a Snapchat streak is, it's people sending photos to each other to maintain Time: 06:20 - 06:30 this. I asked around office and this is what their streak count was 2000,000 [Music] 1,56 Time: 06:30 - 06:40 449. So I asked them how much money or badge or what do you get when you get a streak? Like what's the end goal? And they said Time: 06:40 - 06:50 it's fun. There's no end goal. That's why I think this is a crazy hack. And because of Time: 06:50 - 07:00 these tactics, Indians on average spend 194 minutes or 3 hours on social media every single day. And you know what's Time: 07:00 - 07:10 ironic? The owners, the founders of these social media apps themselves publicly say that they prevent their own children from using these apps. Maybe because they understand the Time: 07:10 - 07:20 consequences. But I'm not just talking about bias. We're also talking about something a little more uh scary. It's how your brain develops. You see, people Time: 07:20 - 07:30 who are addicted to their phones and can't stop scrolling actually have lower gray matter in their preffrontal cortex. Our cognitive load, our thinking, Time: 07:30 - 07:40 analytics comes from that side of the brain. So if you don't exercise it like a muscle, it actually doesn't develop. And we've actually proved it. The consequences of mobile fold dependence are horrible. Psychological distress, Time: 07:40 - 07:50 emotional instability, decreased self-control, reduce work performance. But the scariest out of all of them is isolation. Time: 07:50 - 08:00 [Music] Time: 08:00 - 08:10 Now imagine the brain is designed for let's say this level of stimulation. But Time: 08:10 - 08:20 now with social media you are overstimulated and you're way over here. So when you get bored with any app, you just switch to Snapchat. And then you get bored of that, you switch to Instagram or LinkedIn or something else Time: 08:20 - 08:30 which gives you that dopamine rush and you always want to stay in that over stimulated stage which is not normal but you have normalized it. In fact 70% of Time: 08:30 - 08:40 teens who are away from their phones report that they're anxious. That's why when you look at Instagram reels, there's a new feature where even in a Time: 08:40 - 08:50 30-second reel, they have a jump ahead. I mean 30 seconds someone can't wait five seconds and they have turned this into a product. But what if this Time: 08:50 - 09:00 addiction ceases to exist and that becomes the worst nightmare of an addict and it's exactly what happened to Karan when he left his phone at home. Time: 09:00 - 09:10 [Music] Time: 09:10 - 09:20 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Oh Time: 09:30 - 09:40 Please. Time: 09:40 - 09:50 Please. Time: 09:50 - 10:00 [Applause] Time: 10:10 - 10:20 [Music] Time: 10:20 - 10:30 Woo! Time: 10:40 - 10:50 [Music] Thank you. [Applause] [Music] Time: 10:50 - 11:00 Heat. Heat. [Music] Time: 11:00 - 11:10 [Music] Time: 11:10 - 11:20 [Music] Time: 11:20 - 11:30 Karan. Karan, honestly, I'm a bit worried about you. And you know, Karan, I know all these Time: 12:00 - 12:10 videos on the internet are blaming all these companies, but they're not focusing on something. They're all saying it's not in your hand. Addictive, it's not your fault what to do. But Time: 12:10 - 12:20 they're completely wrong. You actually have the most important part to play in this entire thing. You can decide that you want to focus. You can decide that Time: 12:20 - 12:30 you want to move your body because that brings you pleasure. You can change the tiny habits that you do. Even getting up early, 15 minutes early a day and doing Time: 12:30 - 12:40 those five push-ups dramatically changes you from the rest of the population. And those tiny changes actually make a whole lot of difference because if your Time: 12:40 - 12:50 trajectory was this, it can become something completely different from a tiny change you make today. So promise me if you do these two things and start Time: 12:50 - 13:00 today, you'll be completely different from everyone else because we aren't helpless. You can get out of autopilot mode if you really really want to. Time: 13:00 - 13:10The sad reality is that the person explaining this use Retention Editiing to keep you hooked up and we watch such content on Social Media itself!",

      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:10 Credit card? You're obviously not paying on time. I knew it you were going to say this. I have created this tracker. I have all of my payments written here. Okay, that's good. Now, show me your Time: 00:10 - 00:20 home loan calculation. The interest rate is very high. So I can actually help you save some money on this loan and therefore I will not increase your salary. Time: 00:20 - 00:30 If you're not able to save then double appraisal. Okay. Three questions and 11 lakhs I will save. If I'm able to do it no appraisal. Okay. Question number one. Yes sir. Do you pay your credit card bills every Time: 00:30 - 00:40 month? Yes. Full payment. I make full payment. Minimum payment. Keep full payment. Yes sir. All payment done. Let's say you have 30,000 rupees balance that you have due Time: 00:40 - 00:50 pay full 30,000 or pay the minimum due which is let's say 1 1500 you choose the smaller number or the larger number smaller number always sometimes Time: 00:50 - 01:00 sometimes right so here's the problem when we paying a credit card bill we think if we pay the minimum payment we've made some payment but no you're supposed to make the full 30,000 payment Time: 01:00 - 01:10 let me show you something magical here I'm damn sure you didn't know this this is a Excel sheet. It shows the opening balance right now is 30,000 which means Time: 01:10 - 01:20 you owe 30,000 to the credit card company. Cool. Done. All right. And then we can see there is interest. There's minimum payment principle and closing balance. Now we want this closing balance to be Time: 01:20 - 01:30 zero. Yes. And there is a minimum payment. Let's assume we pay just the minimum payment every single month for 12 months. Time: 01:30 - 01:40 No expenses in the upcoming months and no other expenses. Just so we can assuming assuming. Okay. Just so we can calculate this 30,000. Did you know this 3 12% interest rate is Time: 01:40 - 01:50 actually 42% yearly interest rate and then over the 12 months you'll actually pay roughly 16,600 on 30,000 Time: 01:50 - 02:00 on 30,000 and your actual 30,000 will only reduce by 5,000. So basically thees are you owed you paid 16,600 but actually only 5,000 was removed from Time: 02:00 - 02:10 30,000. that 30K becomes 25K and the rest I think 11,000 something went all to interest Time: 02:10 - 02:20 so I should make full payments you have to make full payments because every time you pay minimum due you're paying 42% yearly in interest sir I have a question so the amount is Time: 02:20 - 02:30 30,000 okay I mean I don't have it up right so what should I do um okay actually there's one thing you can do um you can convert this into an Time: 02:30 - 02:40 EMI. Yeah. So you convert it into a 6 month or 12 month EMI and because it's divided and you're showing intention to the company that hey I'm going to pay Time: 02:40 - 02:50 back as this schedule then it goes from 42% to like a much lesser number. I think over here it shows like 18%. Which Time: 02:50 - 03:00 is still really high by the way and this will improve my credit score if you pay on time. Yes. You want to see an example? Let me show you. So let's assume 5,000 is the amount. Time: 03:00 - 03:10 There'll be a processing fee. There'll be an interest rate of the 18%. I said the EMI will be 878 rupees. This is to this is to I can give Time: 03:10 - 03:20 and duration is 6 months and the total interest is 266 rupees. So look at 5,000 at 42%. 5,000 at 18%. Look at the difference in interest you're paying. Time: 03:20 - 03:30 So after if I do this I'll be able to buy my house. Why don't you focus on your skill so you can earn more and then why are you always I want to buy this. I want to buy this. I don't want to buy the email. Time: 03:30 - 03:40 [Music] Okay. H second question. Why the hell are you spending so much money every single month? What is all this? Why two phones? Time: 03:40 - 03:50 So, oh no, no, no. That's not me. That's my friend. And this is Pulkit. This is Bratis. This is Nisha. So, whenever they need help, I'm always there for my Time: 03:50 - 04:00 friends. So, I just give them my credit card. But no, there's a problem here. You're not following the credit utilization ratio because it's so high. your actually score will come down. So that's Time: 04:00 - 04:10 the problem. I know. I know. Okay. So let's imagine that this is your credit limit. Very s I have enough credit limit. Yeah. Time: 04:10 - 04:20 This is your credit limit and you are using say most of it 70 80%. Okay. This means you're overextending yourself. Maybe you're not earning is not good. So the bank doesn't see it as Time: 04:20 - 04:30 a good thing. You want whatever your limit is you want to use only 30 40% of it. Sir I have a credit card this limit is let's say charl help me understand this Time: 04:30 - 04:40 in that context so one situation uh you are under 40% so 40% of four lakhs is 1.6 lakhs okay you've not spent more than 1.6 six lakhs Time: 04:40 - 04:50 on the card you're fine to my credit score is safe. Yeah. In this case of course credit utilization uh criteria it's safe. Uh case two and let's take an extreme Time: 04:50 - 05:00 case you use the entire credit limit. So full lak off entire fax. Okay. What you can do is that before the billing cycle starts off you pay off Time: 05:00 - 05:10 your loan char. I mean you shouldn't take the loan in that case if you can't pay it. If you pay it off before the bill is generated, it will not reflect to the credit Time: 05:10 - 05:20 bureaus. Oh, so even if I use 80% before the bill generation, I should pay it off. Yeah, but please don't do that. But example, you do all these things, time will go by, time will go by, your credit Time: 05:20 - 05:30 score will improve. Will it happen tomorrow? No, nothing happens tomorrow. Everything takes time. Now, let's move to the third question. Hey, I I know one hack. I know one hack. Time: 05:30 - 05:40 Okay, listen to me. I will take two more credit cards. Huh? That will increase my credit limit and utilization. Wow. Time: 05:40 - 05:50 That is reality. I have one card only because you are not financially disciplined. If you seem very credit hungry to the banks and you're taking multiple cards, Time: 05:50 - 06:00 when you actually go to the bank for a new card or a new loan or whatever, they'll perform something called a hard check. And when they do that to check, they'll say, \"Yeah, this person is asking for too many loans.\" And your Time: 06:00 - 06:10 credit score will actually fall. Isn't the entire point of reduction of your choices to take a loan? So when you add this, your financial discipline will get screwed, right? I've seen a lot of Time: 06:10 - 06:20 people on the internet say this, just get two more cards. No, if you're not financially disciplined, don't get more cards. And if you're not financially disciplined, get no cards. Time: 06:20 - 06:30 Okay. So now the third question, right? How do you think and why? Yes, sir. I have one more hack. Just tell me. So I have used my credit card so much. Yes. Yes. I would have accumulated a lot of Time: 06:30 - 06:40 reward points. Correct. Okay. If I use that, maybe next year I'll save some money. Maybe flight Time: 06:40 - 06:50 shopping. That will save money. No. How many points do you have? I have. What's the conversion? What kind of card is it? Time: 06:50 - 07:00 It's a good card. And conversions by you actually getting some value. Show me the card again. Is it written on your Excel sheet? Yeah, it's about the details. It says Okay. Over here it says earn four reward Time: 07:00 - 07:10 points in every 150 rupees spent. So basically for one lakh spent you'll get about 2,000 reward points. And if you actually do the math that means let's Time: 07:10 - 07:20 assume you're redeeming a flight booking. Okay. So basically you saved uh 2,000 reward points and if you multiply Time: 07:20 - 07:30 by.5 you saved 1,000 rupees on the ticket. How do you feel about that? I think your calculation is wrong. No, it's actually my card. It's it it's good. This card and why I chose airline Time: 07:30 - 07:40 tickets is that this card is a shopping card. So, you can't it the conversion for flight bookings isn't really good. My point is very simple. Time: 07:40 - 07:50 So, each card specializes in a kind of transaction. So, you have like a travel card for people who are frequent flyers. You have um shopping cards, you have fuel cards for different use cases, Time: 07:50 - 08:00 right? And then you have to spend it intelligently. Sometimes the cards get devalued. So the value changes, the conversion changes, etc., etc. So if you're blindly just spending in hopes Time: 08:00 - 08:10 that someday you'll use the reward points, that's not the right way. I have a lot of good friends who know how to use these cards and yes, they fly for free in many cases, but I don't know if Time: 08:10 - 08:20 you have that much effort to put in. You said I should not get many cards, more cards because that will affect my credit score. Yes, you shouldn't. You said shopping, Time: 08:20 - 08:30 travel, finance card. I said that is what it's for. So unless you really understand the system, you can't um hope that reward points will make sense for Time: 08:30 - 08:40 you. You know what I'm saying? Cool. So that's basically it. Thanks so much. Take care. How much money have I saved so far? First, we'll get your credit score. Time: 08:40 - 08:50 What? Which is 700. Okay. You Why? Why is the question? 700. 700. Uhhuh. 700. Loan amount is 1 CR. M interest rate is 9 12%. Time: 08:50 - 09:00 20 years your EMI is about 75,000 total repayment 1.78. Okay. Now let's say for the next 2 years you work on improving your credit score. You pay all your Time: 09:00 - 09:10 credit card bills on time. You keep the utilization ratio below 40%. And your credit score does improve. So this credit score then becomes 750. Time: 09:10 - 09:20 Huh. Okay. Now the loan amount everything is the same but the interest rate goes from 9 1/2% to 8 1/2%. automatically just go to the bank and say check my credit score please give me a better Time: 09:20 - 09:30 rate they should offer you between 8 1/2 to 8.75 now I've assumed a slightly better scenario I've assumed 8 1/2% which is quite possible and the loan Time: 09:30 - 09:40 tenure and everything is the same you'll see here that the change in interest rate of 1% will save you over 11 lakh rupees oh Time: 09:40 - 09:50 so better behavior actually converts into actual savings now you can use this 10 lakhs somewhere so the problem actually is not with credit cards, it's with humans. Although obviously Time: 09:50 - 10:00 and when humans aren't following and doing the right things, they actually end up doing stupid things and losing money, which is what you're not supposed to do. Remember, credit cards, loans are Time: 10:00 - 10:10 actually not bad. You don't understand it. Make sense? I do. I do. Now you do. Yes. So I don't have to give you a appraisal now Time: 10:10 - 10:20Give abhishek an appraisal",

      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:10 office are willing to spend four times their actual monthly salary to own this phone. And if you even compare this to say an Android phone, which may have Time: 00:10 - 00:20 better specs and features on paper, why are people actually buying an iPhone? camera, work, UI interface, blogging, camera, data, privacy. But what if I Time: 00:20 - 00:30 told you people are actually not buying it for all these features, but they're actually buying it for something completely different. Actually, I have a story for you. The story begins with Agarwal Anank. And this man in that Time: 00:30 - 00:40 mahala was the only house which had a lawn but also had a Zen and a Maruti 800 outside his home. No one at that time Time: 00:40 - 00:50 actually owned a car. You know what's common with the iPhone, the car, the color TV, the CD Walkman, and all these other items. At a certain point of time, Time: 00:50 - 01:00 other people could not afford it. It was expensive. Second, when someone bought it, they showed it off. It was visible to everyone. And third, they all talked Time: 01:00 - 01:10 about why this is changing their life for the better. But all of these were actually purchased not for the features, but for social signaling. When you look Time: 01:10 - 01:20 at the iPhone and say it's the best, what do you really mean? The iPhone is one of the slowest charging phones. Benefit of Android phone of the year 2023, the Pixel 8. It's the backbone of what they're building off of is I would Time: 01:20 - 01:30 take the screen from the S22 Ultra. Different phones are good for different things and in many of them, iPhone does not rank one. iPhone is selling cool, Time: 01:30 - 01:40 not just features. Why do people keep still buying it? Actually, Tim Cook says this beautifully. He says, \"Our objective has never been price Time: 01:40 - 01:50 optimization or selling you a lowcost phone. His objective is to sell you a really great phone.\" And they try to do this with all the tech that they do, but Time: 01:50 - 02:00 at a low cost to themselves. And what happens is that people tie this object that other people can't have to their identity, which is why it's called the Time: 02:00 - 02:10 identity trap. But the identity trap gets a little worse because it starts with a gateway purchase. Let me explain how this works. Any good product is Time: 02:10 - 02:20 designed really well to work within an ecosystem. Other products from that mother company that fit perfectly well to make it good. For example, the GoPro, you can't just buy the normal GoPro Time: 02:20 - 02:30 because once you're done with normal GoPro, you want the underwater version. So, you have to buy a fitment on top of it so you can actually waterproof it. All of these guys have other products Time: 02:30 - 02:40 that fit seamlessly to make your life actually easy. So, this is not really a trap. It's more like a better product, but you just get sucked into it because Time: 02:40 - 02:50 you have to buy more from them again and again and again. And you'll notice the same beautiful design is in Apple as well. When you send a normal text message versus an iMessage, there's a Time: 02:50 - 03:00 difference. The AirPod, for example, perfectly syncs with your existing device and all the other devices. you can switch between them very very easily. All of these things make it nice Time: 03:00 - 03:10 to use an Apple product because it connects with your existing ecosystem beautifully. This is a pretty old playbook, but just Apple makes it look, Time: 03:10 - 03:20 you know, like I hate to say it, sexy. You might think that all these ecosystem upgrades are pulling you in and these are actually western constructs. This is Time: 03:20 - 03:30 not true. One of the best examples of an ecosystem lock is actually school. You go to the school and you think you have to pay the fee. Time: 03:30 - 03:40 But no, there are five different kinds of uniforms your parents have to pay for. Then there's the fate. There is the school excursion they had not planned. Time: 03:40 - 03:50 And then there are other events. They could be handprinting, drawing, other hobbies. That's an ecosystem lock because at this point once your son or your daughter is inside a school you Time: 03:50 - 04:00 can't say no right everything we see which is really profitable has the ecosystem lock now an ecosystem itself isn't a bad thing right I mean Time: 04:00 - 04:10 capitalism hair so people will lock you in and you will pay more the question is how do you get started and in Apple this thing is really really tricky you would Time: 04:10 - 04:20 think that right now people are buying the latest iPhone, but there is data to show that people are actually buying the iPhone 13, which is three generations Time: 04:20 - 04:30 away. Can you tell me why? Because it's cheaper and you can enter using a refurbished route. So, a used iPhone is what you can buy. And finally, you can Time: 04:30 - 04:40 signal to your friends that, \"Hey, I'm part of your club, too. I just paid a little less.\" So once you enter the refurbished route, you will actually want the latest one cuz you now crave Time: 04:40 - 04:50 all the features that your iPhone does not have. And you'll also see all the other items as well, like the MacBook Time: 04:50 - 05:00 and the iPad and everything else that they sell, which is now not available to you. You just have half a product. What happens is that you look at the new iPhone and what you see is this. A Time: 05:00 - 05:10 monthly EMI of 6,000 something to own the thing you've been dreaming of. Just 6,000, right? Of course not. You Time: 05:10 - 05:20 actually don't see all of these items that you'll actually want to buy. And this is the real cost. The iPhone is 80,000. The MacBook Air 99,900. The Time: 05:20 - 05:30 AirPods 4 is 12,900. The Apple Watch SE is 24,900. The iPad is 49,900 and the total cost is 2.67 lak rupees and this Time: 05:30 - 05:40 is the minimum cost. This is not even the high-end version of these devices. And it doesn't stop here. It continues Time: 05:40 - 05:50 digitally too. You must have seen this on purchase. They'll say, \"Who's going to take care of your iPhone?\" I said, \"I'll take care.\" They said, \"No, we'll also take care. Please buy Apple Care.\" And then they have all this buying the Time: 05:50 - 06:00 iCloud service which will keep going up because you'll keep using the iCloud. Eventually it'll run out and because of the sync you'll have to upgrade that Time: 06:00 - 06:10 too. And then you have Apple 1 which bundles all these subscriptions in one place. You'll need that too because well it just works so well. The point is this EMI over here is a lie because you will Time: 06:10 - 06:20 buy a bunch of other things and your expense is going to be more than what you thought it is. But it actually doesn't stop there. Look at this. 36% of Time: 06:20 - 06:30 all Apple users actually upgrade to a better device, the newer one being launched every 1 to 2 years. So what started with a single new phone of Time: 06:30 - 06:40 80,000 rupees went up to a couple of lakhs. For some people, the journey didn't even start with 80,000. It started with a used phone and then they Time: 06:40 - 06:50 ended up spending so much. From a business lens, this is magnificent. People won't buy stuff if your product isn't good. You are not forcing them. They are doing it by choice because of Time: 06:50 - 07:00 societal pressure, because how cool you've made it, because of the messaging, the marketing, the tech, and the product is working. But from a personal finance lens, you're buying things because of external validation. Time: 07:00 - 07:10 And it's probably not the best thing for you, especially if you can't really afford it. And this brings to our final point, the illusion. The illusion Time: 07:10 - 07:20 started when you were a kid. Every year you wanted something that you wanted that no one else had. Remember that MRF bat? The best bat you could buy when you Time: 07:20 - 07:30 played cricket? That was the iPhone. Then in my life, it was the PlayStation. I and another friend had a PlayStation Time: 07:30 - 07:40 and each of us had different games. Whoever had the best games, our friends would congregate on that area. That was my iPhone back then. The point is every Time: 07:40 - 07:50 few years you've also had an iPhone equivalent your life and you achieved it, got it, but that pleasure didn't last. Even today you want another MRF Time: 07:50 - 08:00 bat. Except it's not the bat, it's the iPhone. Once you get the iPhone, you'll want something else. And this will never ever end. Let me simplify this for you. Time: 08:00 - 08:10 Take a piece of paper, divide it into two, and on the right side, write reaction. And on the left side, write things I really want. On the reaction Time: 08:10 - 08:20 side, you'll react to stuff that happens outside of your control, but you respond to it. Similar response theory. Basically, when a new iPhone launches, it's really cool. You feel like buying Time: 08:20 - 08:30 it. Put the word new iPhone there. Then a new gadget releases, put that word there as well. Next time you open an app, there is a sale on something. Put that thing over here. All these things Time: 08:30 - 08:40 are you reacting because they're creating an urgency though. You should buy it right now. And on the left side, you have stuff you've been wanting for a while now. Maybe it's the PlayStation. For me, Time: 08:40 - 08:50 it's traveling to certain countries and doing these crazy experiences. You've got to make sure that this part doesn't drain your money such that you're not able to do the stuff you really want Time: 08:50 - 09:00 over the long term. Is the iPhone really something that's career life defining? If it is, put it over here and then you should go and buy it. And that way, Time: 09:00 - 09:10 Apple won't be fooling you. You won't be fooling yourself. And you'll be buying something you actually want. Time: 09:10 - 09:20this guy really hates apple. he might be a doctor.",

00:20 so simple imagine this a woman Kavita working 12 hours a day on a farm tirelessly for barely 300 rupees and is Time: 00:20 - 00:30 working to earn for a family of six people now during the day what would she have for lunch maybe Dal chavel or something nutritious but in most cases it's actually no lunch and just a packet Time: 00:30 - 00:40 of gutka there are 7 CR Indian women who suppress hunger with gutka and this economically makes sense for them because if they eat less and they can Time: 00:40 - 00:50 spend more time working earning and spending less money on food in fact if you look at this data here this chart Time: 00:50 - 01:00 you can see that the poor people living in rural areas and those with no schooling actually have a very high chance of consuming gutka more often than not these people work in the Time: 01:00 - 01:10 unorganized sector where the physical labor is really hard really demanding so if you have a cheap product that relaxes people gives them a little bit High Time: 01:10 - 01:20 improves their mood and makes them work harder so they can earn for their family is it really bad but the problem with gka is that it's leaving Le stains all Time: 01:20 - 01:30 over the country and it's a national embarrassment and you see because parents are eating gutka so openly then their children also copy it's easy to Time: 01:30 - 01:40 hide it's cheap and kids actually consume it so should it be banned probably yes Time: 01:40 - 01:50 right but it's easy for me to say this for people like Kavita the answer is not so black and white and another reason is Time: 01:50 - 02:00 culture you know tobacco become a cultural part of India but how does something become part of culture Time: 02:00 - 02:10 marketing if you think tobacco and gutka ads don't impact anyone think again Time: 02:10 - 02:20 you're completely wrong now technically you cannot actually advertise these products but companies are smart they found a way to bypass these regulations really cleverly these ads are promoting Time: 02:20 - 02:30 CDs soda bottled water and even chai and they're not really promoting a sin this is called Sate advertising where they're Time: 02:30 - 02:40 advertising a less popular product but because of the brand Association they're really advertising something Time: 02:40 - 02:50 else now gutka companies may do surrogate advertising but cigarette companies can't because of stricter regulations thanks to to ca but then how Time: 02:50 - 03:00 did it even become part of culture actually I have an interesting story for you craving something sweet and don't want those extra calories don't worry Time: 03:00 - 03:10 reach for a cigarette cigarette making you cough don't worry get one with a filter tip even your doctor recommends It Anyway Time: 03:10 - 03:20 back then there were no rules about marketing so they went freaking crazy and they even sold to kids Time: 03:20 - 03:30 they sold to kids and for men they sold us the idea of being Bly be a malbora man is what they said and they became Time: 03:30 - 03:40 the biggest cigarette seller ever so if you wonder why Indian teenagers smoke to look cool now you know so looking at your friends the cool Time: 03:40 - 03:50 kids everyone trying smoking in the peer pressure you also try it once twice one more time and slowly it becomes a habit Time: 03:50 - 04:00 and then everyone's doing it and it becomes normal and that my friend is how it becomes part of culture and once something becomes part of culture it becomes really difficult to ban you just Time: 04:00 - 04:10 normalize it it becomes part of life and it's just how you live but there's one other big Time: 04:10 - 04:20 [Music] problem and that's passive smoking and look at these graphs that we found here you can see that in north and Central India over 60% households people Time: 04:20 - 04:30 actually smoke and in some Northeastern states it's 90% so basically it means it's culturally normal for elders to Time: 04:30 - 04:40 smoke in front of people so younger people will be influenced to smoke when they grow up it's like when you're in your office and your colleague takes you outside and your smoker friend smokes Time: 04:40 - 04:50 and that smoke comes right into your nostrils and why I'm not a smoker the problem of passive smoking is that you get the repercussion that a Time: 04:50 - 05:00 smoker gets you see at the end of a tip when a smoker is smoking that fume is worse than what the smoker is inhaling because there's no filter to filter it Time: 05:00 - 05:10 and in fact if you look at this data here one out of 10 tobacco related deaths were due to passive smoking so basically even if you don't consume BD or cigarette you are being affected by Time: 05:10 - 05:20 it because of the passive inhalation so why aren't we just Banning it well because it makes money for the Time: 05:20 - 05:30 economy okay this is really interesting some women in villages perform the task of being a BD roller and if they do this Time: 05:30 - 05:40 they get a BD card the BD card is so prestigious that's almost equal to a government job giving them regular work PF and so many other benefits in fact Time: 05:40 - 05:50 the women who hold BD cards find it really easy to get a groom and also don't have to pay any dowy think about it the entire tobacco industry employs Time: 05:50 - 06:00 4.5 CR people in the entire process collection of the leaves manufacturing the farming in fact just BD rollers in Time: 06:00 - 06:10 the country are 44 lakh people and you have 22 lakh tribals involved in leaf collection the problem is really simple if you ban tobacco these 4.5 CR jobs are Time: 06:10 - 06:20 at risk in fact they'll vanish it's equal to like a small country population somewhere 4 and a half CR Time: 06:20 - 06:30 another reason is farming you see the tobacco crop is drought resistant which means it can grow at places where other crops cannot be harvested profitably so Time: 06:30 - 06:40 a tobacco farmer can actually grow it in a really short period of time since it's a short duration crop and in 3 months it can Harvest and sell it and there is Time: 06:40 - 06:50 always a buyer for tobacco so for Farmers it's a great way to actually earn money especially if they don't have fertile land they can grow tobacco and earn some cash India is the second Time: 06:50 - 07:00 largest producer of tobacco in the world so clearly it's a huge cash crop for the economy but you know if we ban tobacco Time: 07:00 - 07:10 something interesting would happen and that's illegal sales and loss of Revenue so let's talk about loss of tax revenue now if you look at tobacco Time: 07:10 - 07:20 it is really highly taxed because it's a Sy tax and rightly so the government earns about 53,000 CR rupees every Time: 07:20 - 07:30 single year and this was a few years ago 2025 it's probably going to be higher now what the government can do is increase the taxes even more so the consumption reduces logically that makes Time: 07:30 - 07:40 sense but will consumption actually reduce probably not because there'll be illegal sales if taxes are increased way Time: 07:40 - 07:50 too much then people will stop buying the Branded cigarettes that are being sold right now which means the unorganized markets will actually open up and they'll sell cigarettes illegally Time: 07:50 - 08:00 at cheaper options now this is not only bad for our government because it reduces their revenue it's also bad for the consumer because maybe these illegal unregulated products are just worse for Time: 08:00 - 08:10 your health in fact something like this has happened in the past in the 1920s in America but the product was not tobacco it was alcohol and it was called Time: 08:10 - 08:20 the prohibition the prohibition stated that you cannot consume alcohol and it cannot be sold which reduced Road rages which red used fights but it also had Time: 08:20 - 08:30 another effect the crime bosses got up controlled the alcohol trade and sold it illegally and made tons of cash which means the government didn't make money Time: 08:30 - 08:40 the gangsters made cash and it was bad for health for the consumers too holy it's interesting that any question never has a yes or a no there's always Time: 08:40 - 08:50 like a gray to be decoded but I don't think you can ban tobacco if people want to smoke they will smoke but the solution is probably in Media this Time: 08:50 - 09:00 entire mess started with media where it showed that smoking was cool maybe if we change that and the imagery of tobacco becomes uncool the Next Generation 30 years from now won't smoke anymore Time: 09:00 - 09:10 It’s more embarrassing for us as a country that people have to eat gutka to suppress hunger.",

      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:10 in gold and Arjun is worried whether he should stop his sip but I think she's just scared because you know the market could fall even more I know during Corona the market fell like what 38% and Time: 00:10 - 00:20 now the market is down only 133% I think the question you're really asking is should you invest right now or should you just exit actually let me show you a Time: 00:20 - 00:30 chart this is Nifty in 2024 it goes sideways it goes up Falls a little bit goes up it was a beautiful bull market Time: 00:30 - 00:40 and this is what looks like now for 5 months the market has been falling some people calling it a crash some people saying a recession may happen why did this happen to understand this you have Time: 00:40 - 00:50 to zoom out look at sensex from 1986 to 2024 you'll find something you've never seen before in 1986 we had the mounting Time: 00:50 - 01:00 fiscal deficit which caused a 41% fall there was a balance of payment crisis in ' 91 which is minus 39% there was the harad mea scam decline of 54% there was Time: 01:00 - 01:10 aom bubble in the year 2000 which was minus 56% we had a 2006 Market selloff there was the global financial crisis in Time: 01:10 - 01:20 2008 which was a 61% fall and of course very recently we had the Corona virus pandemic which was minus 38% now the problem is you're not an Time: 01:20 - 01:30 economist you're not a research analyst you're not a hedge fund Trader with some algorithm which can tell you what stock to pick and choose you're a retail investor like you and me and I think we Time: 01:30 - 01:40 need a basic economics lesson here the economy is dynamic and so are the markets markets move in Cycles basically markets don't move in like a straight Time: 01:40 - 01:50 line like in The Last 5 Years Nifty has given returns of about 15% and then you'll see phases like this when there is a fall of many many months in in fact Time: 01:50 - 02:00 in some cases these Falls can be as steep as 39% and that's completely normal but if falling Market is normal then everyone should be investing right Time: 02:00 - 02:10 but the shocking truth is completely different look at this this is the Sip stoppage ratio which basically means how many people have stopped their Time: 02:10 - 02:20 sips look how high that is you'll notice when the market Falls people get fearful and they stop their sips but as the market is Rising people won't start Time: 02:20 - 02:30 investing immediately they need proof that the market is safe so unless you start moving up a lot or make new highs people don't really start investing more Time: 02:30 - 02:40 seriously and regularly which means we are going to play the market Through The Eyes of fear and not Through The Eyes of logic the advantage of a falling Market is simpler than you can imagine every Time: 02:40 - 02:50 time the market Falls it's actually a gift for the long-term investor let's suppose you invest 10,000 rupees every single month no matter what happens to Time: 02:50 - 03:00 the market and simply by doing this on this Excel calculator which I've given you in the description you can do this for yourself change that number you'll see an xir this is basically Returns the Time: 03:00 - 03:10 returns for this is so much but what if I stopped my sip when the market fell what would happen to this return let's find out so I'm opening the Sip over Time: 03:10 - 03:20 here and every time I notice the market fell just March 2020 if I scroll back to March 2020 I can actually delete this Time: 03:20 - 03:30 10,000 rupees and Everything Will Change now I'll do this for all the falls in the last four five years and see what happens to the xir the returns are now Time: 03:30 - 03:40 drastically less you know why because every time I invested I only invested in the markets were going up when the market fell I could not average down so Time: 03:40 - 03:50 the summary is you should not stop your sip but the question Still Remains about lumpsum what about people who want to do a lumpsum or people who want to invest in particular stocks and that portfolio Time: 03:50 - 04:00 is really down here's what you should do we look at two data points and then I'll talk about how you should interpret those data points okay the first one is on a chart this is nifty50 index and Time: 04:00 - 04:10 I'll put three moving averages the first moving average is the shortest moving average this is as you can see your Time: 04:10 - 04:20 30mon moving average because we on a monthly chart then is the most interesting the yellow moving average which is a 100 month moving average which means every 2 years one data point Time: 04:20 - 04:30 gets collected and then we have Beka which is 50 month moving average which is one data point every year and when the market comes here it's really really Time: 04:30 - 04:40 fairly valued now the problem is we are pretty far away from here how do you know Will the Market come to this moving average or this moving average or this Time: 04:40 - 04:50 moving average this is a question mark and I'll answer this question but we have the second point over here which is the Nifty price to earnings ratio it's very simple look at just the blue line over over here okay so the blue line Time: 04:50 - 05:00 over here at 42 shows that the market is very expensive and when the Blue Line comes down like over here 18.9 to you know the market is like fairly cheap so Time: 05:00 - 05:10 how do you know what is fair well the long-term average from 1999 to 2025 the current PE ratio average is about 20.8 to the median and the market is at 20.3 Time: 05:10 - 05:20 so is the market fairly valued here's how you interpret both of these data points I'll tell you through the story of 2020s market crash of Corona so if I Time: 05:20 - 05:30 look at the technical chart during Corona the market touched blue and touched yellow fine and then when I opened the p ratio around uh 2020 is Time: 05:30 - 05:40 where here the market was then priced at 25 and I knew the long-term average is 20 or somewhere around that I think it was 18 at that time so I thought 18 is Time: 05:40 - 05:50 average Market at 20 Market is crashed the world is crashing the world is burning so I should wait for the market Time: 05:50 - 06:00 to be fairly priced therefore I stopped any Investments and I waited for the market to fall because logically speaking looking at all the data the Time: 06:00 - 06:10 market should fall right and this was the biggest mistake nobody in the world including the biggest investor and the new rookie know Time: 06:10 - 06:20 what the market is going to do no amount of analysis no algorithm nobody knows all of these data points is to Time: 06:20 - 06:30 basically tell you all is well you don't have to do all of this maybe knowing this makes you feel secure but the safest thing to actually do is Time: 06:30 - 06:40 just do a freaking investment every single month and if the market Falls a little more maybe you can do a lump suum but trying to predict how much the market will fall even I couldn't do and Time: 06:40 - 06:50 I've been trading and investing since 2007 nobody knows this the reason I showed you this is when you show a lot of data people think intellectual and Time: 06:50 - 07:00 something interesting will happen but I pretty secure to tell you all of this is nice to hear and it's good information but it can never predict the market shut Time: 07:00 - 07:10 up and learn to invest every single month for the rest of your life you can thank me later Time: 07:10 - 07:20 It doesn't matter if your name is warren buffett or jimmy Buffett, nobody knows whether tomorrow the market is going to be up, down, sideways or in circles.

Adjusted for it, the actual expected return is only 5 % post\ninflation. FIIs are constantly selling from the Indian market because they have better places like USA to invest with more\nstable returns (There was no concept of better investment opportunity in COVID).\nAnd additionally, the major sectors like Banking are facing higher NPAs, IT companies are not able to pay and retain\ntalent and hire freshers, Pharma and Steel are facing threats of 25 - 100 % tariffs from the biggest market which is USA.\nUntil the US has higher and safer returns than India, India wont see a BULL market this year.",

00:40 money but here are the stats nine out of 10 traders in the fno segment actually made losses in fy22 and the average loss was 1.1 lakh rupees and these are not Time: 00:40 - 00:50 some random stats sebbi says it and if you remove the profitable outliers just 6% of all fno Traders individually made Time: 00:50 - 01:00 money and the average profit was just 3,400 rupees 3,400 rupees was the average profit what so basically very Time: 01:00 - 01:10 few people actually make money in options so we'll talk about all the things that seem shiny about options we'll talk about the good we'll talk Time: 01:10 - 01:20 about the bad cuz certainly the Internet isn't telling you the truth so let's get started Time: 01:20 - 01:30 so before we understand why people lose money in option trading let's quickly understand what derivatives are if you already understand this you can skip ahead if you don't know what it is we'll Time: 01:30 - 01:40 do a quick understanding of what and how they work so just like you can buy and sell shares in the cash Market you can also trade in the derivatives Market Time: 01:40 - 01:50 with Futures and options a derivative is exactly how the name sounds you derive the prices from something else like the prices of Cur and butter can be derived Time: 01:50 - 02:00 from the prices of milk so if the prices of milk go up of course the prices of CD and butter will also go up because that's the raw material needed to build Time: 02:00 - 02:10 this item it's a derivative similarly the derivative Market is derived from an underline usually stocks and shares so here's an official definition of an Time: 02:10 - 02:20 option contract an options contract is a financial agreement that grants the buyer the right but not the obligation to buy or sell a underlying the underlying could be stock or share or Time: 02:20 - 02:30 something else at a preset price within a given period so infosis option contract derives its value from infus shares and like that famous movie Time: 02:30 - 02:40 dialogue let's explain with a simple example so let's imagine you want to buy a cycle you know the simple tining the cycle you go into a shop and he says if Time: 02:40 - 02:50 you want to buy it please pay me cash right now you say sir I don't have the money right now but what I can do I can Time: 02:50 - 03:00 give you 1,000 rupes up front to block this particular cycle cuz I like this design and in 10 days time I will come Time: 03:00 - 03:10 and I'll pay the rest and the cycle is 10,000 rupees by paying the 1,000 rupees let's call it the premium you were able to block and say that I have the right to buy this cycle for 10,000 rupees Time: 03:10 - 03:20 within the next 10 days now notice the cycle is the underlying 10,000 rupees is the strike price or the price that you want to buy and 10 days is the time Time: 03:20 - 03:30 limit or the expiry date within which you can complete your obligation now the reason that he paid 1,000 rupees upfront and not the entire 10,000 rupees is Time: 03:30 - 03:40 because he's a little unsure he's a little unsure whether he'll actually ride the bicycle and he really needs it he wants to think about it and he's also unsure of the price in fact he's Time: 03:40 - 03:50 speculating that the price of this cycle may go up or down for multiple reasons now two things can happen you can either come before the 10 days pay the rest and and take the cycle or you come back Time: 03:50 - 04:00 after 10 days what do you think is going to happen do you think that the owner is going to sell you the cycle after deducting that 1,000 Advance you gave to Time: 04:00 - 04:10 him what's likely going to happen You've Lost That 1,000 rupees because you did not complete the contract you said you'll come back in 10 days and buy the cycle but you didn't so he will not Time: 04:10 - 04:20 honor it and that 1,000 rupees is gone now can someone force you to buy the cycle no you've bought the right it's not an obligation if you don't want to Time: 04:20 - 04:30 buy it don't but if you don't then at 1,000 rupees it's gone now of course options isn't that easy there are other aspects to this as well this particular Time: 04:30 - 04:40 example is a call option where you're saying that you want to buy this stock or in this case the cycle within a particular time in the stock market you Time: 04:40 - 04:50 can do the opposite too you can also buy a foot option where you think the price of the underlying of the stock is going to fall so now here is the thing you Time: 04:50 - 05:00 have a bunch of variables here first you have Direction whether you think the price of the underlying is going to go up or down second you have the token amount that you're paying for that's the Time: 05:00 - 05:10 premium this moves as well then you have the expiry date this entire contract expires at a certain time in the future by adding all these variables the Time: 05:10 - 05:20 prediction of the prices becomes really tough especially when it's within a time limit this makes option Trading really Time: 05:20 - 05:30 really complicated and difficult but despite this option trading is on a rise people love trading options because Time: 05:30 - 05:40 money can seem like it'll come quickly and it's just it's just exciting and that's the Jud of the entire problem in fact people love options so much 400 Time: 05:40 - 05:50 times more option contracts are traded than actual cash market and if you look at this you'll see people are trading options way more versus is any other Time: 05:50 - 06:00 country but why is this let me show you one thing which will blow your mind this is Asian pains and I can see that Asian pains has risen in This Time by about 3% Time: 06:00 - 06:10 if you had invested 1 lakh rupes you would have made 3,000 this is how a normal investor would think about 3% as a return but the same time frame if Time: 06:10 - 06:20 someone had taken a call option it would have gone up by 137% now you tell me someone who's never Time: 06:20 - 06:30 traded in the market who has no idea how the stock market Works has never invested finds out that one stock went up 3% and the same stock in the Time: 06:30 - 06:40 derivatives Market went up 137% in the same time period which is what one day he'd think let me start trading and figure out how options work let me make Time: 06:40 - 06:50 this example a little more exciting this 137% and all sounds interesting but in real cash what does that mean so if in derivatives Market you can't just buy Time: 06:50 - 07:00 one share you have to buy a certain number of shares that minimum number of shares is called a lot now I can see that Asian pains is a minimum of 200 Time: 07:00 - 07:10 shares but you know in the derivatives Market it's not trading at thousands of rupees like the cash Market it's actually trading at 29 rupees for this Time: 07:10 - 07:20 example so 29 rupes multiplied by 200 you would have paid 5,800 Rupees to make this one one trade Time: 07:20 - 07:30 and this 5,800 rupes would have given you a 137 profit theoretically this is what beginners think it's a low investment cost and it seems like you Time: 07:30 - 07:40 can double your money very easily so a small Capital lots of volatility and in a small time frame you can double your money it Time: 07:40 - 07:50 feels and this is the second point the barrier to entry is really low if you look at any option contract that you're looking to buy um I mean it costs 1 rupe Time: 07:50 - 08:00 10 rupes 20 rupes 30 rupes and it feels like it's easy let's see if I can make 20% Which comes to the third Point Time: 08:00 - 08:10 influencers sometimes these people mention specific products to make you transact in them sometimes they think it's a good idea sometimes they get a commission through an affiliate link but Time: 08:10 - 08:20 whatever the reason is a lot of these people were also in options and in options the thumbnails were crazy Time: 08:20 - 08:30 when you see a thumbnail like this which says 5 lakh rupees in 5 minutes you might click because you're curious you might watch a few minutes because it's Time: 08:30 - 08:40 entertaining you might watch the next video because you really want to understand how we made 5 lakh rupees in 5 minutes and if someone can actually do that why aren't they rivaling aani and Time: 08:40 - 08:50 then we have the Advent of the internet over the last few years opening an account with a broker has become really easy access has has become really easy Time: 08:50 - 09:00 so anyone who's not even read or seen this Channel or read Varsity or done anything to understand how markets work can just trade and that is the Time: 09:00 - 09:10 definition of gambling and because of all of these reasons we've gone from 7 lakh traders to 45 lakh traders in a Time: 09:10 - 09:20 really short period of time and in fact I can see here that over 85 billion option trades were placed in India that's 83% of Global option trades take Time: 09:20 - 09:30 a moment to realize how much that is 80% of the number of option trades happen in India that's a problem because I don't Time: 09:30 - 09:40 think most of these people understand how option works and most of them are gambling but you know what's the most interesting thing out of all these facts it's this 89% of option Traders lose Time: 09:40 - 09:50 money and this is not me or our research team saying this sebbi said this so why do people lose money now in this I'll only explain about buying an option Time: 09:50 - 10:00 we're not going to talk about writing an option or selling an option because it might get a little complicated because this video is for absolute beginners so the first thing is limited time let's Time: 10:00 - 10:10 say we take two trades one is where we buy a stock and let's see what happens to the stock and second is we buy a call option we are bullish on it in the Time: 10:10 - 10:20 option Market this stock didn't move at all for the next 3 days look at that it's barely moved okay this means whatever you invest is lugbug the same Time: 10:20 - 10:30 let's look at our call options of the same underlying because the stock didn't move well the options also should not have moved right but as you can see it's Time: 10:30 - 10:40 Fallen more than 15% now you tell me why did the option fall 15% if the market didn't move only what Time: 10:40 - 10:50 happened this is called Theta or time Decay basically the option contract has an expiry date and as you go closer and closer to the expire day the value Time: 10:50 - 11:00 becomes closer to zero so this adds a new dimension not only do you have to predict the direction of the price you also have to predict how fast it'll go you also have the option premium well Time: 11:00 - 11:10 now you also have time you have to predict when this will happen it has to happen sooner and predicting that it's kind of difficult the second reason is Time: 11:10 - 11:20 just plain lack of knowledge there was this survey over here where the survey said 40% people enter you know because they think they can double their money Time: 11:20 - 11:30 quicker now when you start trading you could lose money or make some money so let me tell you some two interesting stories we found here is a story of one Time: 11:30 - 11:40 guy who started trading with a capital of 2 lakh rupees and he says you make a few wins then you realize it's quick money then you go all in and one day I Time: 11:40 - 11:50 lost 1 lakh rupees clearly this person hadn't spent any time understanding how the option Market Works he just went in to make some quick money thought of it it is gambling and this is what happened Time: 11:50 - 12:00 another story on Reddit is even more interesting he first made 5,000 rupees then made 20,000 rupees in 5 minutes and thought this is not that tough I can Time: 12:00 - 12:10 figure it out and eventually he lost 59,000 rupees in just a few hours and as soon as this happens something interesting occurs in your brain your Time: 12:10 - 12:20 brain tells you and intellectualize it saying if you spent a few minutes to earn money you lost money it's part of the game you'll find a way to make back Time: 12:20 - 12:30 that loss and then get back in the game and then you start trading a little more aggressively this my friends is called Revenge trading you probably don't know Time: 12:30 - 12:40 this because you're not in the cycle but anyone who has should tell their story in the comments if you have lost money in fno without understanding how it works please tell us your story and let Time: 12:40 - 12:50 the Z1 Community understand what are the pitfalls and psychological tricks you tell your mind and lose cash for no reason and I think all of these Behavior your turns into addiction right Revenge Time: 12:50 - 13:00 trading I want to trade again I'll find a new strategy I watch YouTube videos I do all these things and I'll feel like taking one more trade and it becomes Time: 13:00 - 13:10 well an addiction and that's a problem and we have the perfect story here as well here we can see that someone says after losing 1.8 lakh in options I told myself I'll stop but I did it again this Time: 13:10 - 13:20 is a definition of addiction the fourth point is wrong influence imagine someone watching a YouTube YouTube video and then trading I mean right I mean who Time: 13:20 - 13:30 watches YouTube videos and then starts trading I mean can you imagine someone taking a large portion of their salary and actually putting it to options of Time: 13:30 - 13:40 course this is true and that's why this is a point over here we found this really interesting story of someone who bet half of his entire salary in option Time: 13:40 - 13:50 trading and lost it all here he says the lessons I learned is that if something is too good to be true it definitely is Time: 13:50 - 14:00 and here it says 36% of option Traders are under 30 and you know they have this for more of the market and they want to make that money quick and we also know that 37% of people spend their trading Time: 14:00 - 14:10 Capital after getting influenced by social media the guys on the internet don't really care about your Capital they care about their own stuff so don't Time: 14:10 - 14:20 listen to them it's weird I'm saying this when I'm talking to you on a social media platform but well I'm de influencing it so say 01 rocks if you thought this was a nice episode please Time: 14:20 - 14:30 say something in the comments we're trying to make videos which appeal to a larger audience which are simply understood without getting too technical so we thought there should be some series de influencing all of it so let Time: 14:30 - 14:40 me know what other episodes we can do see you in the next one and if someone can actually do that why aren't they rivaling Amani right why Time: 14:40 - 14:50 anyway let me explain with a simple answer let me explain with a simple Time: 14:50 - 15:00 I was doing it for effect Time: 15:00 - 15:10 Purchasing a stock may seem straightforward, but selecting the correct stock without a proven strategy can be exceedingly challenging. I've been working on expanding my $210K portfolio for a while, and my primary obstacle is the lack of clear entry and exit strategies. Any advice on this matter would be greatly appreciated.",

00:20 simple so I'll invest the increment percentage okay full n SI and you'll make one in 10 years come here sir Time: 00:20 - 00:30 every week how do you come up with a 1 CR plan now I'm smart what's the plan see I'll tell you I'll invest my increment in mutual funds Time: 00:30 - 00:40 the 10% goes into mutual funds yes and then it will make me one CR in 10 years or so my Excel sheet says but hold on Time: 00:40 - 00:50 you selected mutual funds and they going to make you 1 CR how did you select the mut I I know just just look at this you see this list you see these top three funds the first one what top return Time: 00:50 - 01:00 funds correct returns genius look at this no what's this number got it 36% 36% cagr and you projected this into the Time: 01:00 - 01:10 future 10 years and that's how you money Miss not cool tell me one thing uh when you select a stock what do you look at to select a Time: 01:10 - 01:20 stock sometimes you buy stocks also right what do you look at you have only taught me I look at the fundamentals sales revenue profits I look for the Time: 01:20 - 01:30 sectors it sector banking just in case if it sector goes down banking saves my portfolio nice sounds complicated how many metrics is this 10 15ish I don't Time: 01:30 - 01:40 know okay and how many metrics did you look for mutual funds returns and the reason is ke mutual funds are managed by experts and all you have to do is select a fund correct actually no there is a Time: 01:40 - 01:50 way to actually analyze mutual funds as well so instead of looking at 15 20 metrics like you do why don't I tell you Time: 01:50 - 02:00 some 1 2 3 4 5 6 metrics that we look at and based on that you can select a mutual fund you don't want to see me make 1 now I don't know about that but I don't want to see you die because your Time: 02:00 - 02:10 expectations are too high let's [Music] Time: 02:10 - 02:20 begin so the first thing we're going to do is look at something called rolling Time: 02:20 - 02:30 Returns what you are looking at is cagr this is a different kind of Ro give me the poker chips okay so what a mutual fund manager Time: 02:30 - 02:40 is essentially doing money yeah and he is thank you Time: 02:40 - 02:50 juice I'll ask you questions and if you make the wrong you have to eat drink Thea juice cool okay cool so a mutual fund manager Time: 02:50 - 03:00 is basically investing in different companies and diversifying your risk let's say with an equities now sometimes out of pure luck which is completely Time: 03:00 - 03:10 fine one of the stock does extremely well does that make sense yes is return is massively better than last year's Time: 03:10 - 03:20 because this one stock or sector or a group of stocks did extremely well and it skews the average and because of that the portfolio looks really nice in terms Time: 03:20 - 03:30 of returns so how do we know that the manager has luck or skill on his side so we look at something called rolling returns so now think about Time: 03:30 - 03:40 Cricket in cricket if you have a batsman and he's scoring 40 40 40 50 50 50 that means there is some consistency you see a pattern but what if someone scores Time: 03:40 - 03:50 example there 200 somewhere in in one game and the next few games is 40 40 40 but his average is also 50 who is actually better the one which is who is Time: 03:50 - 04:00 going through consistent average exactly same thing in mutual fund so basically we need consistency when we selecting a fund and that's important sir I already know this okay then can I get a Time: 04:00 - 04:10 laptop so what a rolling return does is basically you try to capture multiple returns at the same time so let's say we Time: 04:10 - 04:20 have six years to look at okay we look at year 1 to year 4 Isa returns are 20% now let's start from year two so two to Time: 04:20 - 04:30 year five five so 2 to five returns are 16% now let's go to year 3 three to year is 88.7% okay so if you had to go Time: 04:30 - 04:40 forward you'll say year four to year seven and so on and so forth so you won't see the average of the last seven years you will dissect it a little bit Time: 04:40 - 04:50 and see it's a rolling return makes sense now this is fund a okay now the same Time: 04:50 - 05:00 thing we'll do on fund B which is 30% for first then 20% Then 177% almost 18% 18% so on one hand we have 20% 16% 8% on Time: 05:00 - 05:10 the other hand we have 30% 20% and almost 18% which is more consistent fund B clearly right and both can actually Time: 05:10 - 05:20 have a similar cagr similar return but you want to go with the one that's more consistent all you have to do is Google the fund name Time: 05:20 - 05:30 click on rolling Returns on whatever website you go to and just compare whether the numbers are almost the same sir this is easy so basically I'll just compare two funds and it's done right oh Time: 05:30 - 05:40 wait wait so when you look at when you look at a fund you have to compare it to The Benchmark which is for every fund The Benchmark is different another thing you can also do is compare this with the Time: 05:40 - 05:50 category average as well to see how other funds are performing what is category a so categories basically you might invest in a certain Mutual fun category like a hybrid fund or a large Time: 05:50 - 06:00 cap Equity Fund Etc or an Els fund you just compare s funds in that category where does your fund stand it's a Time: 06:00 - 06:10 comparison with the category average this can also be found online not an easy this is easy it's easy so you you compare with the Benchmark you compare with the category average rolling Time: 06:10 - 06:20 returns and you're good the next performance metric is the sharp ratio what ratio sharp ratio sharp ratio sharp with the E before explaining what sharp ratio is we should actually explain what Time: 06:20 - 06:30 standard deviation is hello let's imagine there are two aircrafts of two different brands flying from Mumbai to Delhi the flight let's say is 2 hours Time: 06:30 - 06:40 long okay now one flight operator is usually late so on one day it's 35 minutes late on another day it is 40 Time: 06:40 - 06:50 minutes late on one day it is 10 minutes late but if you look at it mostly it's about 25 minutes late that's an average it's 25 minutes away from the mean the Time: 06:50 - 07:00 expected the 2 hours so standard deviation is 25 minutes okay the second flight is late only about 10 minutes Time: 07:00 - 07:10 most of the time so standard deviation is 10 minutes 108 10 so now that you know AA standard deviation of time is 25 minutes the other is 10 minutes which one which will yes obviously of course Time: 07:10 - 07:20 this is what standard deviation is how far away do you deviate from the mean now to explain sharp ratio first let me ask you a question Time: 07:20 - 07:30 question let's suppose you have an investment option that I'm giving you and I'm saying there is a possibility of making a 100% return on this I'll take Time: 07:30 - 07:40 it and there is a second option J you will make only 10% as a possibility which one would you pick okay now what if I told you the Time: 07:40 - 07:50 risk in this is 100% if it doesn't work out I will get your house and if in this one J you're Time: 07:50 - 08:00 making 10% if this doesn't work out Max you lose is 1% which one would you pick now but 10% is much lesser than 100% Time: 08:00 - 08:10 which one would you pick I love my house so what you just did was you didn't look at just returns you looked at risk if the risk is too much and this is stupid risk you just won't take the risk right Time: 08:10 - 08:20 H correct H the this is what the sharp ratio does it Compares your returns to the risk that you're taking because look at a fund we say 30% returns but how Time: 08:20 - 08:30 much risk are you actually taking we want to know it's calculating basically your returns uh divided by the standard Time: 08:30 - 08:40 deviation of that fund now the interesting thing is numerator it's actually coming from the difference between your fund and a risk-free Time: 08:40 - 08:50 interest rate you know why risk-free risk free FD yeah fixed deposit please sir three Time: 08:50 - 09:00 pleas FD is not risk-free your risk-free number actually comes from government securities [Music] Time: 09:00 - 09:10 ma actually I'll show you one example this fund that I've opened over here it's sharp ratio is 1.43 so this is good decent I would Time: 09:10 - 09:20 compare this fund to all other funds in the same category and see what their shop ratio returns Etc are so if I'm looking for elss fund I look for Sharp Time: 09:20 - 09:30 ratio comparing I'll get the best sort of fund and remember you can't optimize for just one metric you have to have a balance of everything so now let's see a risk metric what do all mutual fund ad Time: 09:30 - 09:40 say mutual fund say n PCO PCO mutual funds are subject to Market Time: 09:40 - 09:50 risk beta let's talk about beta so basically beta measures the funds volatility Against The Benchmark it could be Nifty could be Nifty 100 could be whatever but that's what beta Time: 09:50 - 10:00 measures so you will tell me the answer now okay I'll give you a clue you also guess so a beta of one means your fund volatility Time: 10:00 - 10:10 and The Benchmark volatility is the same it's one now let's say your fund is 1.2 more volatile by how much 2% 20 20% and Time: 10:10 - 10:20 let's say the beta is8 it is 20% less volatile than the Benchmark that's it now the question is Time: 10:20 - 10:30 which one will you choose higher than one lower than one just select the one which is equal to the Benchmark no I think it's a very subjective ratio but Time: 10:30 - 10:40 there is another ratio which actually answers this question to a number and it's called the capture ratio which will have another ratio there's an upside capture ratio and there's a downside Time: 10:40 - 10:50 capture ratio so let's say Nifty moves up 5% okay and let's say your fund moved up only 1% it's a very bad fun it's very Time: 10:50 - 11:00 bad but what if your fund moved up also moved up 5% though it's a good fund now it's upside capture ratio is one so let's say Nifty moved up 10% and your Time: 11:00 - 11:10 upside capture ratio is two that means your fund moved up 20% which means you want an upside capture ratio greater than one now what do you think will be Time: 11:10 - 11:20 the answer for the downside capture ratio I will not look at it no no no no you want to make sure that your downside capture ratio is less than one so if Time: 11:20 - 11:30 Nifty Falls 5% you want the fund to fall oh not 5% less than 5% less than 5% of course last two metrics we will go to Time: 11:30 - 11:40 a assets under management which is the total amount the fund has in its Corpus that it's investing uh usually what happens is people go to a category and Time: 11:40 - 11:50 they click AUM and they see the largest fund and they think that's a good fund because everyone's bought it I'm not saying don't don't buy the highest AUM Time: 11:50 - 12:00 fund or buy the smallest fund not saying that so what I would say is remove AUM from your metrics when you're looking at um a fund the last one is the total Time: 12:00 - 12:10 expense ratio you know what this is right uhuh what is it TR or total expense ratio is the fee Time: 12:10 - 12:20 that the mutual fund company charges you to handle your money I knew this Time: 12:20 - 12:30 selfconfidence is the key so what you want to do is you want to make sure that you're investing in a fund just TR is acceptable again don't Time: 12:30 - 12:40 go just for the lowest TR because what's the acceptable te I don't know you'll have to look at all the funds in your category and see Time: 12:40 - 12:50 what the range is because the TR changes and I can't give you a range for it so now you have six metrics all of them on your screen and I hope all of them in your head when you look for a mutual Time: 12:50 - 13:00 fund it'll take less than 5 minutes for you to go through all of these five or six metrics but once you do you'll be a little more confident no one can pick Time: 13:00 - 13:10 the best mutual fund a stock to give you the best returns nobody all of these things are done so you can sleep well at night knowing you did everything you Time: 13:10 - 13:20 could in Your Capacity and is and that's the true key to happiness also for appraisal also and for returns Time: 13:20 - 13:30 expectation also keep them low hope for the best appraisal expectation should be high No it should be low so then if you you give us if it's decent then you're Time: 13:30 - 13:40 happy thank you sir for the appra no there's no appraiser I hope you like this episode if you did give a like say something in the comments and see you in Time: 13:40 - 13:50 the next episode and I'll get like and subsscribe sales Time: 13:50 -

00:20 best part I get to meet different clients and it's not like a normal boarding desk job you know so it's nice oh so good to hear bet but you must be missing her Time: 00:20 - 00:30 G there a lot of Indian restaurants so it's not a problem it's it's good same same pizza every day I need I need my Time: 00:30 - 00:40 spacious home my friends how will I even survive over here especially with this job this wasn't my dream why did I even come [Music] Time: 00:40 - 00:50 here all right something was definitely wrong here I mean lacks of students go abroad and lacks of people actually go to get jobs s in foreign countries but Time: 00:50 - 01:00 their expectations there is some mismatch here so in this episode we're going to De influence the expectation about what people have when they go Time: 01:00 - 01:10 abroad and all those expectations will meet with a reality check so we'll talk about the good and we'll talk about the bad cuz certainly no one else will so let's get started Time: 01:10 - 01:20 [Music] Time: 01:20 - 01:30 [Music] before starting I'd like to make it clear there's nothing wrong with going abroad of course there are a lot of opportunities of course it's an Time: 01:30 - 01:40 interesting idea to pick for you to consider having a career abroad the problem isn't going to a foreign country the problem is the expectation we have and people around us have of why we are Time: 01:40 - 01:50 going there so that's what we're going to De influence in this episode so first let's look at some stats Indians are actually going abroad more than ever in Time: 01:50 - 02:00 fact Indians are going abroad for higher studies more than 68% than the previous year this translates to 4.44 lakh students enrolled in universities which Time: 02:00 - 02:10 has now become 7.5 lakh students in 2022 so you can imagine how many people are actually going to study abroad and the Time: 02:10 - 02:20 total numbers are even more in 2019 there were about 1 million that's 10 lakh students studying abroad and this number is likely to be closer to 2 Time: 02:20 - 02:30 million students in the year 2025 so this is clear Indians love studying abroad and this number is increasing and studying abroad doesn't come cheap I Time: 02:30 - 02:40 mean the average US College charges anywhere between 10 lakhs to 40 lakh rupees and this is all in the student fees staying over there etc etc that Time: 02:40 - 02:50 money is spent on studying and if you look at the entire Market Indians spend about $47 billion a year that's billion with a B and this is expected to become Time: 02:50 - 03:00 70 billion by 2025 so now let's talk about Indians going abroad to work over here the numbers don't disappoint in Time: 03:00 - 03:10 about 2 years 28 lakh Indians went abroad to work that's 2.8 million people that's about 1,000 Indians a day about 30,000 Indians a month all of these Time: 03:10 - 03:20 people going abroad to work so if you look at the trend you have people going abroad to study spending lots of money people going abroad to work and Time: 03:20 - 03:30 hopefully earning a lot of money as well but net net people are going abroad more than ever so why are Indians going abroad there could be multiple reasons one reason could be that there's way too Time: 03:30 - 03:40 much competition here watch the episodes on De influencing engineering and NBA to know what I'm talking about and because there's so much competition it's really Time: 03:40 - 03:50 tough to get a good job or a good pay that could be one they perceive outside to have lesser people and therefore their chances of getting a better job increased Time: 03:50 - 04:00 the second perception could be that abroad is just a nice place the quality of living is better the air is nicer the people are nicer it just looks so damn Time: 04:00 - 04:10 sexy in those Instagram pictures the third reason could be the NRI tag the status that comes with saying or from wherever he's back Time: 04:10 - 04:20 everyone in the society will think wow dollar he lives abroad and the fourth reason could be that they perceive abroad to be clean cleaner less chaotic Time: 04:20 - 04:30 and just a better place to stay because India is not as clean as it's perceived to be abroad but the thing about foreign countries is that we only look at the Time: 04:30 - 04:40 bright side because we have media television Instagram and all these other things that tell us that there is a better Greener lawn abroad and that we Time: 04:40 - 04:50 are not getting that Greener lawn so instead of focusing just on the good part we thought we'd add a little bit of the darker side so let's talk about the problems with going abroad so let's look at some numbers and I'll need a Time: 04:50 - 05:00 whiteboard for [Music] this okay economics 101 every economy Time: 05:00 - 05:10 goes through an expansion phase a peak a contraction phase a trough then an expansion phase again and so forth now Time: 05:10 - 05:20 no one can really predict when this happens because it doesn't happen uniformly like I've done it over here but it does happen it's completely normal it's a feat of an economy and it Time: 05:20 - 05:30 happens to every country in the world so the first thing you should know is that this expansion phase this is when opportunities arise new industry comes money comes companies are getting funded Time: 05:30 - 05:40 they're starting new Industries salaries are going up increments are good everything seems very nice during this phase at the peak people are looking Time: 05:40 - 05:50 back at data and saying dude last 5 years 10 years and the perception of the economy is Time: 05:50 - 06:00 this will continue forever because of XYZ reason then comes the contraction phase now remember contraction is completely normal it always happens when this happens first there is some denial Time: 06:00 - 06:10 the economy goes down maybe increments don't happen maybe the job opportunities are less a lot of companies shut down Etc it seems that the economy is bad and then you have the Time: 06:10 - 06:20 trough now why I'm telling you this is that India is here right now which means India also has a lot of opportunities look at this chart over here you can see this line represents the GDP growth rate Time: 06:20 - 06:30 of UK and we also have the GDP growth rate of India now baring the portion where covid happened if you look at just Time: 06:30 - 06:40 India India has been growing a lot so why should you say there are only opportunities abroad remember India's GDP growth rate is larger than the US in Time: 06:40 - 06:50 the last few years which means India has a lot of opportunities don't ignore that now if you're going abroad for a particular kind of industry make sure Time: 06:50 - 07:00 that that industry is in its growth phase and it's actually growing so my point is if you look at say Healthcare and Hospitality these two industries are growing a lot in the US so if you have a Time: 07:00 - 07:10 interesting and good opportunity over there then maybe you can consider it but manufacturing on the other hand has been declining for a while so taking an opportunity there to go abroad probably Time: 07:10 - 07:20 is not a good choice you should weigh the pros and cons of whether that industry is doing well or not before you decide and now let's talk about the qualitative information no one really Time: 07:20 - 07:30 talks about but I'll get rid of the so Point number one lack of jobs there are less jobs than they used to be Time: 07:30 - 07:40 right now so there are a lot of stories of people saying that they're considering options back in their home country because the momentum of the hiring that was happening a few years Time: 07:40 - 07:50 ago isn't there anymore so while the number of people going abroad is at record levels are there really enough jobs to absorb all of that Supply Time: 07:50 - 08:00 think about it you need demand to be increasing and Supply to be constant for salaries to go up if the supply is too much which is too many people are going abroad but the number of hiring is not Time: 08:00 - 08:10 increasing what do you think is going to happen to the opportunities the opportunities at least temporarily will come down in fact you can see a lot of stories where a lot of expats who are Time: 08:10 - 08:20 Indian are trying to come back and their queries to HR firms is are there jobs at cxo levels for me in India which means Time: 08:20 - 08:30 they're considering coming back to home base and this is not only us there is an interesting Trend happening in Singapore and Europe over here we can see that Time: 08:30 - 08:40 Europe is a tough market for freshers and Singapore says they prefer hiring singaporeans and not xats usually xats came with a Discerning skill that could not be found anywhere else and that's Time: 08:40 - 08:50 why they got preference but now it seems like locals get a little more preference because of their hom ground advantage and it seems like their upskilling is as well and because of this trend Indians Time: 08:50 - 09:00 are left with no option but to take up blue collar jobs and that's the expectation mismatch if you studied went abroad expected a certain kind of job Time: 09:00 - 09:10 and don't get it and you end up with a blue collar job because you have to uphold the money you spent you have to uphold the family respect that's a Time: 09:10 - 09:20 problem because this will cause mental stress Financial stress and of course you just get upset Point number two there's a hous in Time: 09:20 - 09:30 crisis the housing crisis is actually real there is no affordable housing across say Europe or Australia or Switzerland and all these places Time: 09:30 - 09:40 students spend 40% of their expenses on housing so let's look at a typical student trying to study in a college in Australia now once he figures out what Time: 09:40 - 09:50 college he wants to study at he has to figure out accommodation now the College can only accommodate 10% of its total students that's its limit because Jag Time: 09:50 - 10:00 they can only accommodate 10% so the other 90% have to find an off-campus accommodation and this could be somewhere nearby but the problem with finding a house nearby is that it's too Time: 10:00 - 10:10 expensive so they're only left with the alternative to find a house 10 or 15 km outside where it's slightly more cheaper Time: 10:10 - 10:20 but you know adding to the W the cost of these accommodations also went up by 15% in a single quarter point number three mental breakdowns you know this is Time: 10:20 - 10:30 something no one talks about now imagine you moving to a brand new city where you don't understand the language you don't understand the people or the culture and Time: 10:30 - 10:40 taking time to adjust to the city well take some time but the same thing imagine if you do in a different country it's the same thing but on steroids you Time: 10:40 - 10:50 don't understand the culture you don't understand the people you're still trying to understand the language and you feel a little alienated because your family isn't there and this is not a Time: 10:50 - 11:00 guess this is a reality for people who don't understand the culture they're getting into because maybe they don't consume the same media you do they just consume Indian media and suddenly go Time: 11:00 - 11:10 abroad and face the shock of their lives and they can't process it if you look at this article it talks about how studying abroad has become lonelier especially after covid-19 pandemic and Time: 11:10 - 11:20 international postgraduate students have had higher rates of depression anxiety stress thoughts other than the UK population and a few of them actually Time: 11:20 - 11:30 find help to find it now I'm not saying you can't go through this in India in your own country it just becomes a little more exaggerated when you do this abroad and if you understand this and Time: 11:30 - 11:40 know how to combat it you should be completely fine point number four house help you lazy person you there you lazy person I don't think you realize that Time: 11:40 - 11:50 all the help we get right now with a Mali coming home you probably have a driver there's probably someone who helps you with jarup POA you probably have a cook someone helps you with Time: 11:50 - 12:00 cleaning the house do you realize what a privilege this is can you right now close and thank your stars that you are able to have some of this because around Time: 12:00 - 12:10 the world especially in the developed countries this doesn't happen it's simply unaffordable to have any help at home you got to do this all by yourself Time: 12:10 - 12:20 the median salary of a house help in the US it's actually what $30,000 that's a lot even if this is a Time: 12:20 - 12:30 little exaggerated and you take a lower number that's a lot of money so people don't have any house help they do everything by themselves Point number Time: 12:30 - 12:40 five PPP or purchasing power parity now we all know that the cost of a bread in India is different from bread that you purchase in say Europe the purchasing Time: 12:40 - 12:50 power is very different this means a certain amount of money can buy a lot of things in India and that same amount of money can buy less things in say you so you can follow a PPP calculation to Time: 12:50 - 13:00 actually know what's the purchasing power of that amount for example a lot of people say I have a $100,000 salary abroad and you think 100,000 is equal to Time: 13:00 - 13:10 83 lakhs damn but that's not the right way to do it the living costs are much higher than Time: 13:10 -

      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:10 this sunduk, it's been passed down through three generation. And this right here, this camera, um, Time: 00:10 - 00:20 so why is it that when you buy something in 2025, the damn thing doesn't last as long? The answer is actually in these Time: 00:20 - 00:30 three objects. And I'm going to explain to you why don't companies build durable stuff. Think about the HMT watches. Time: 00:30 - 00:40 I remember my father talking about having an HMT watch that his grandfather used and how long the damn watch lasted. Time: 00:40 - 00:50 Not to mention how pretty it actually looked. But those watches were just durable. Another example is Tupperware. Everyone talks about it that Tupperware Time: 00:50 - 01:00 is good, hygienic, very good-looking, but lasts really, really long. Hence, in both these cases, there is no repeat purchases. And my guess is both of these Time: 01:00 - 01:10 companies went bankrupt because the products were so durable, there was no repeat purchase. So businesses understood that they had to make a product that's not just super highquality, not just super durable, but Time: 01:10 - 01:20 just good enough that you require replacement in the future. And it's a good first purchase. >> Let's start with the most ingenious door in any refrigerator. It has special Time: 01:20 - 01:30 places for bottles and it also lifts out. But that's just the doors. Think of all you can store in here on these big firm shelves. You get a shower of ice Time: 01:30 - 01:40 cube frosty dry. You get the best when you buy free air. >> You know that company still exists and creates this pretty normal looking Time: 01:40 - 01:50 fridge cuz well consumerism. Also think about furniture at your daddies or nani's home. They have beds and closets with real solid really heavy doors Time: 01:50 - 02:00 and they are really really proud of these sofas. It'll never go bad. But nowadays you don't get that quality. [Music] Time: 02:00 - 02:10 Instead, you get something called particle board. Particle board is sawdust, a bunch of pieces of wood glued together, and that's your furniture. Time: 02:10 - 02:20 The widespread systematic degradation of all the products around us becoming worse in quality is not by accident. It's called planned obsolescence. It's a Time: 02:20 - 02:30 concept where manufacturers can deliberately reduce the lifespan of the product after a few years of use. And Time: 02:30 - 02:40 because of this, the repeat purchase becomes more important. Remember this bulb right here? This is where planned obsolescence actually started 100red years ago. Time: 02:40 - 02:50 >> A birthday party for a light bulb. >> Happy birthday, dear light. Happy birthday Time: 02:50 - 03:00 to you. [Applause] Back then there was a cartel formed to represent the entire bulb industry. It was called the Feebas cartel, meaning Time: 03:00 - 03:10 bright. And what they wanted to do was make sure that bulbs don't last too long. I'm not kidding. The bulbs were lasting so long that there were no Time: 03:10 - 03:20 repeat purchases. And that was bad for the industry. So the cartel said anyone who builds a bulb that lasts more than 1,750 hours, they would find that bulb Time: 03:20 - 03:30 manufacturer a certain amount. And this was so effective that that practice became the foundation of consumerism. But there's a problem. Let's suppose Time: 03:30 - 03:40 your bulb or whatever you're selling doesn't last that long and wears off. There is competition. Someone will choose the same product from another manufacturer and well, you don't win. Time: 03:40 - 03:50 Enter marketing. Marketing is the business of creating desire, showing that you can't have it, selling it to you after a discount and then creating a Time: 03:50 - 04:00 new desire. So companies thought of a genius idea by outsourcing all the manufacturing and making sure they can Time: 04:00 - 04:10 focus on creating desire that is doing great marketing. they were able to create lots of margin which is why most product companies actually are Time: 04:10 - 04:20 storytelling or marketing companies. A good example to understand this are FMCG companies. Time: 04:20 - 04:30 >> They try to sell you something every single week. A lot of them have manufacturer completely outsourced. And if you speak to any agency out there, they will tell you the biggest spender Time: 04:30 - 04:40 on ads online are always FMCG companies because they have to sell you every Time: 04:40 - 04:50 week. Nike, same thing. H&M, same thing. None of this is wrong. It's just really, really smart. But, you know, marketing took it one step further from the Time: 04:50 - 05:00 manufacturing guys. Instead of waiting for the product to actually die, they started explaining why they need the new product even though the old product was Time: 05:00 - 05:10 all right. This is perceived obsolescence. When Apple was selling their iPods, this is the new iPod. The ads were Time: 05:10 - 05:20 interesting because the background was colorful, but the silhouette of the person was black and all you could see are those wired earphones going all the Time: 05:20 - 05:30 way down to the iPod. So, the focus was on the actual wire and that actually made it pretty cool. Every time I saw someone in the metro, I was in Singapore Time: 05:30 - 05:40 back then, wearing those earphones, I thought, \"Damn, that dude is cool.\" But then many years later came the AirPods, >> a new product from Apple called Apple Time: 05:40 - 05:50 AirPods. >> And suddenly the focus changed to just this, not the iPods itself, which means marketing and storytelling and really Time: 05:50 - 06:00 cool edits can shift the focus from one device to another based on just storytelling. And then we have fast fashion. You see, previously before fast Time: 06:00 - 06:10 fashion existed, you had simple companies selling to two major seasons, winter, summer. But fast fashion companies take this a whole different Time: 06:10 - 06:20 level. They actually have 52 micro seasons. That's once a week. To change the trend, manufacture desires. Have you noticed when you buy something from a Time: 06:20 - 06:30 fast fashion company, after fourth or fifth wash, it just fades away? A friend of mine has a t-shirt which is, I kid you not, 17 Time: 06:30 - 06:40 years old. Maybe more than that old. Unreal how new it looks, right? It doesn't even have like the slight fibers degrading. Not even that. So, it was Time: 06:40 - 06:50 like built to last. It was really expensive, but if you think about it, it's lasted way longer. Something for us to think about, right? Do you want to buy something that's one/ird the price, Time: 06:50 - 07:00 but doesn't last more than a few seasons? Consumerism means you buy stuff and when you buy stuff it creates a new problem and the new problems solution by Time: 07:00 - 07:10 capitalists is again marketing but this marketing is a little different. Every time a company strategy tells you Time: 07:10 - 07:20 to change your phone, exchange your headphones, the old one has to go somewhere, right? It goes to a landfill. Time: 07:20 - 07:30 All the poisonous stuff in it, the mercury, the lead actually seeps into the soil like this one here in Gazipur. Tech companies even use this narrative Time: 07:30 - 07:40 to their advantage by saying we have net zero carbon emission. We are using recycled plastic. But think about it. All the other objects inside that device is not plastic. There are other things Time: 07:40 - 07:50 which cannot be disposed. All that does not have a solution yet. It still goes into the soil and causes irreversible Time: 07:50 - 08:00 damage. And it's not just gadgets, it's also clothes. All the dyes and chemicals used seeps into the water and guess what? Gets into your food. And this will Time: 08:00 - 08:10 blow your socks off. A single piece of clothing, like a t-shirt, costs 2,000 L of water to actually manufacture. Time: 08:10 - 08:20 Think about that for a minute. All these forces put together, consumerism, ads, social bubbles, etc. the money telling you to buy stuff, Time: 08:20 - 08:30 desire, put it all together and you get this problem, financial loss. Now imagine a shoe, that shoe, this shoe. You purchase a shoe because Time: 08:30 - 08:40 you think it's 8,000 rupees. This should last about 2 years. So the cost is about 4,000 a year to wear the shoe that you'll wear every single day to the office. So it's all right, right? It's Time: 08:40 - 08:50 4,000 rupees a year for 2 years. Sounds okay. But then you see the new Nike Pegasus out and you Time: 08:50 - 09:00 feel you got to buy that shoe and you absolutely love it and you do and once you do you wear it and people say dude that shoe looks great but you know what Time: 09:00 - 09:10 just happened? This shoe which was 4,000 rupees a year is now 8,000 a year because you will not wear this anymore because you're wearing that shoe now. Time: 09:10 - 09:20 This happens without you even knowing and you're actually spending more per year to use the same thing. Now we can blame the finance company, social media, Time: 09:20 - 09:30 marketing, but the actual person because of all of this is happening is not them. It's actually us. A simple way for you actually to get Time: 09:30 - 09:40 out of this is stop impulse purchases. As soon as you feel like buying something, just wait for one more day. you're giving yourself a night's rest. Time: 09:40 - 09:50 And if you still feel you need to purchase it, then maybe you should. And maybe, just maybe, if as a generation we can stop doing the impulse purchases, Time: 09:50 - 10:00 the manufacturers will have no choice but to hopefully improve the quality of the product that can last a little bit more and something maybe our parents can be a little bit more proud of. Planned Time: 10:00 - 10:10 obsolescence at the end are marketing stories. And if you choose quality plus reuse and repair your products until they give up and you don't choose Time: 10:10 - 10:20 impulse buying, you can actually reverse the entire cycle. [Music] Time: 10:20 - 10:30 One of my Lacoste T shirt is over 35 yrs old... Its a hand me down from my dad ❤... And I still wear it to office it's that good!!",

As a person around vehicles since childhood, I have seen my father going to a local mechanic, asking things to repair,\nand the vehicle would feel good to drive immediately. But these days there is no concept of repair, every Authorized\nservice centre will simply replace the parts, prepare a fat bill and extract money. Given the technology on vehicles have\nimproved a lot, it should have been built to last longer or easy to repair.\n2. I bought a 7k Logitech mouse 2 years ago, which stopped working due to some issue, the Customer care simply says\nthere is no way to repair the product. It is a \"Sell-only\" product.\nIn this market, it is not so easy to Reuse, Repair and Recycle. I really wish we could repair for most of the products we\nuse, but is simply not offered in many places. It is a pain how much wastes we generate due to this.",

      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:10 fing have to do another job I'm talking about the fire movement this movement is happening across the world and you Time: 00:10 - 00:20 should know your number because you control your life yes so how do you get that number follow the link in the description join my Time: 00:20 - 00:30 telegram Channel I will tell you how to get there so you can you know quit that job okay something was definitely wrong with that calculation does that fire number even exist so in this video we're Time: 00:30 - 00:40 going to talk about fire we're going to talk about the good and the bad cuz certainly the internet may be exaggerating things let's Time: 00:40 - 00:50 begin here's a story you get up make your breakfast brush your teeth go to the office speak to your manager do the attendance tell him what works you did Time: 00:50 - 01:00 meet your people at the water cooler have your lunch go back home repeat repeat repeat repeat for the rest of your life and every March hopefully Time: 01:00 - 01:10 you'll get an appraisal this prison that all of us think is a prison we all want to retire from and therefore we got this new imaginative thing called the fire Time: 01:10 - 01:20 financial Independence retire early now how could you possibly not do this routine and still live your life maybe if you had a c and that Corpus invested Time: 01:20 - 01:30 somewhere gives some kind of return and that return is possibly a little more than my expenses then I don't need to Time: 01:30 - 01:40 work right you can also imagine this as a crossover point at some point your savings your Investments are growing and giving you an Roi and your expenses are Time: 01:40 - 01:50 mostly the same at some point the ROI from your corus will cross the expenses you have and now you don't have to work so now all we need to do is find this Time: 01:50 - 02:00 fire number so here's what we have a sheet to calculate your fire number which is this annual expenses divided by 4% so let's say you live in a Metro City Time: 02:00 - 02:10 along with your family and your annual expenses come out to be roughly 10 lakh rup a year you have to insert 10 lakhs in the formula and now you know you'll need 2.5 crores Corpus and all your Time: 02:10 - 02:20 problems will be solved you never have to work again but wait where does that 4% even come from why did we even use it Time: 02:20 - 02:30 now let's talk about the 4% s sir the 01 Fest not right I'm rolling I'm rolling but the missions I have to talk about not in front of everyone no no sir it's going to be epic this thing no no no no Time: 02:30 - 02:40 Fest no Fest right now people use the 4% rule because it's an easy guide for how much to take out each year from your retirement savings and it's also believed to be the basis of the fire Time: 02:40 - 02:50 number this rule came about by analyzing Bond returns from 1926 to 1976 times have changed a lot and 4% as a thumb Time: 02:50 - 03:00 rule is definitely not right you know why because inflation is different from 1990s to 20124 return profiles are different and Time: 03:00 - 03:10 I also think patient levels are different now again going back to the Excel sheet I have annual expenses written here as 10 lakhs I have the safe withdrawal rate of 4% I have a fire Time: 03:10 - 03:20 number but let's scroll a little down now obviously when you have 250 lakh rupees you invest this amount assuming the ROI to be 10% let's see what happens Time: 03:20 - 03:30 to our corpus now we've put this all in an Excel sheet and all we need to know is if we start at 35 with this fire number what happens once we say 70 so if Time: 03:30 - 03:40 I scroll all the way down age 77 the Corpus still has 27 CR rupees let me say Time: 03:40 - 03:50 this again once you have this fire number by the time you're 77 you will still have 27 CR rupees count despite Time: 03:50 - 04:00 accounting for inflation ha life I won B wait a minute tell it how you live it 10 to okay is this actually true let me Time: 04:00 - 04:10 have a look at the Excel sheet so the Excel sheet is assuming that every year the ROI is 10% do you think your expenses will be the same next year and Time: 04:10 - 04:20 you'll add 6% maybe next to next year maybe but let's practically think in this example we've gone from age 35 to Time: 04:20 - 04:30 77 that's probably like three lifetimes from 35 to 45 will the expenses really be the same do you think at age 45 the Time: 04:30 - 04:40 expense profile will change or will the children grow up and want to go to the Harvard equivalent in 200000 whatever it Time: 04:40 - 04:50 is do you think at 55 it'll change it will it's life every 10 years everything about your life changes and because of this your expense profile Chang ches Time: 04:50 - 05:00 this is called lifestyle inflation this fire calculator doesn't account for that it assumes a straight line that the expenses will increase only about 6% a year which is not how life works also 6% Time: 05:00 - 05:10 inflation is a generalized term for the entire country but it differs from locality to state region inflation comes in many different forms and at this Time: 05:10 - 05:20 point you should probably look back and see the last three or 5 years what were the expenses you're doing now that you weren't doing then add up all those expenses and you see that your costs Time: 05:20 - 05:30 have added up because your life has changed what was your lifestyle inflation this year that wasn't there 3 years ago put in the comments we'll have a nice laugh next let's talk about Time: 05:30 - 05:40 longevity longevity longevity means we're assuming we will live till X but we could actually live more I mean who thought someone would want to live more in this life pain but actually because Time: 05:40 - 05:50 of healthare we might actually live longer so assuming that retirement and there is an end date of 7 7 what if you Time: 05:50 - 06:00 live for an extra 10 years huh I don't want to sound bad but come on and if you're thinking you'll get a job at 77 you Time: 06:00 - 06:10 won't ch7 another thing you should be careful about are unexpected events you know we've been running this company for 6 Time: 06:10 - 06:20 years now and we started building 01 a year ago and I am obsessed with taking control of my life there I said it on this episode and that's why I naturally Time: 06:20 - 06:30 make lists about everything lists about work I want to do today list about work I want to do this week this quarter this year now the problem with this is that many times the lists don't check out Time: 06:30 - 06:40 something else happens in life so I started creating an anti- list you know what the anti list is the anti list is stuff good stuff that happened in our Time: 06:40 - 06:50 lives that wasn't planned for and I've been doing the anti list for 6 months now and this is what my actual list looked like for the last 6 months Time: 06:50 - 07:00 and this is the anti list the anti list is much larger than what was planned for but the opposite also happens unexpected events that are negative financially may Time: 07:00 - 07:10 happen so if on this fire calculation you've not accounted for legal cases medical emergencies maybe someone really Time: 07:10 - 07:20 needs the cash Etc that also may be a mistake you will not have straight expenses straight inflation straight Roi life is full of bumps and dumps and Time: 07:20 - 07:30 whatnot so somehow you should plan for an emergency fund which is much larger than your normal and maybe that'll settle down the bumps a little bit more Time: 07:30 - 07:40 so the question is if the normal fire calculation is wrong then what is well good old Excel I'll open the Excel sheet over here you can go to the description Time: 07:40 - 07:50 open it click on file make a copy and make these changes first put in your annual expense put in a safe withdrawal that you actually think makes sense now Time: 07:50 - 08:00 that you understand why 4% doesn't fire number you will get automatically calculated for Roi imagine what an Roi is actually true nift is given 12% you Time: 08:00 - 08:10 should assume way way lower than that and your starting age is 35 change up these numbers exaggerate it a bit to figure out what your final number may be Time: 08:10 - 08:20 around but I have one more thing about this and that's about your expenses the only thing within your control is actually your EXP ense your career Time: 08:20 - 08:30 progression how much money you make all these things are actually not in your control so the first thing you should do if you really want Financial Independence is figure out what part of Time: 08:30 - 08:40 your expense can you remove today so your life is slightly better in the future and the third is something even more interesting but I need someone to take this laptop away from me it is this Time: 08:40 - 08:50 and it's going to be the most powerful thing I ever told you open up a new dock or find a new Fresh crisp piece piece of paper and write an essay the essay is Time: 08:50 - 09:00 going to be one pager of what your one day looks like or one week looks like after you've achieved your financial Time: 09:00 - 09:10 Independence now let's suppose it's 2 CR rupees and you've actually hit it I want you to write down right now what will your first week or one typical week look Time: 09:10 - 09:20 like this is just a catch you can't talk about a holiday you can't talk about buying something you can't talk about a house a car blah blah blah and you can't Time: 09:20 - 09:30 basically talk about anything materialistic that you have to buy you have to talk about your normal routine what time do you get up how do you go to work what exactly do you do you do at Time: 09:30 - 09:40 your work how do you come back Etc and that is what real life is real life is routine remember when we were in school Time: 09:40 - 09:50 we were told ke when you grow up and get to class 5 pen use you can use a pen till then you have to use a pencil then one day after you graduated from 4 to Time: 09:50 - 10:00 5th you could use a pen wasn't that amazing you felt like an adult right remember just using a pen writing that Time: 10:00 - 10:10 date writing the title you felt older it was amazing that was a moment of glory and today if I give you a pen or a Time: 10:10 - 10:20 pencil you wouldn't really care right does it really matter if using a pen or a pencil does it really the car the house the going out are all pens Time: 10:20 - 10:30 and you think that one day once I get that pen I'll have that moment of Glory but the truth is real life is in the monotony of routine and if you can find a way to enjoy Diwali go out have fun Time: 10:30 - 10:40 enjoy the summer that's really what life will be about in the longer run let me know what you thought about this video and see you in the next episode Time: 10:40 - 10:50 I think you got it fundamentally wrong about FIRE. All my life I wanted to achieve FIRE. Now I am 40, I kind of already achieved it as per my calculation. I have a loan free home where I stay, other rental properties and a corpus that can easily fund my expenses. However, I still work like I used to before. I think any sane person would not stop working at 35 or 40. However, I worry much less about loosing my job, getting hike or promotion or what my manager thinks. I know I can take up a different role or job or freelance or work for non profit or do something else without worrying money. That gives me immense mental peace. The irony is I got more career and salary growth after I achieved FIRE.",

I think it's Prateek's life experiences that help us understand because he's\ncapable of putting it so aptly whenever he talks about something.  I'd like to compliment the quote you made: Real life is\nin the monotony of the routine.  I've realised that the Journey to the destination is far enjoyable than reaching the\ndestination itself.  Once at the destination, it almost feels bland and empty?  Sounds cliche, but I think when we have\nsome experiences in life, it starts to make so much sense!  I request the team to keep uploading as much as they can!\nYou guys are making such an impact on Financial Literacy!  Can't wait for the next video now!  Thanks once again!",

      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:10 if they can do it why can't I but the truth can be really different I've been trading for a while now so I'll give you an honest perspective on whether Time: 00:10 - 00:20 intraday trading can actually make money or not so there's nothing wrong with intraday trading and it's not that nobody makes money from intraday trading Time: 00:20 - 00:30 but I think the expectations is a little crazy on the internet so before we delve there let's first understand what's intraday trading what are the Time: 00:30 - 00:40 expectations versus reality and then talk about if it's possible or not and we'll also talk about situations where it's actually profitable so let's start with the first thing what is intraday Time: 00:40 - 00:50 trading intraday as the name suggests is intraday as in within the day markets open at 9:15 a.m. and close at 330 which Time: 00:50 - 01:00 means you take a trade let's say you buy a stock at 100 rupees and then the market appreciates that stock goes to 110 you exit that stock before the day Time: 01:00 - 01:10 ends so it's intraday and you make a 10 Rupees profit now the cool thing is if you had 1,000 shares that you traded with you made 10,000 rupees before Time: 01:10 - 01:20 brokerage taxes and all the other things in just a few hours another interesting thing you can do when you intraday trade Time: 01:20 - 01:30 is that you can profit if the market Falls and we'll talk about this later but the point is that a lot of influencers online nowadays are making it look that intraday is an easy way to Time: 01:30 - 01:40 make millions of rupees but the reality is completely different so why do people like intraday trading and they're Time: 01:40 - 01:50 tempted to actually try it let's talk about the expectations that the internet will set for you for intraday trading the first expectation set is low Capital Time: 01:50 - 02:00 let me explain with a small amount of money you'll be able to control a large amount of stock and because of this your Time: 02:00 - 02:10 profit will also be larger so if you are just an investor the problem is if you invest in say a fixed deposit it will give you 7% a year that doesn't sound Time: 02:10 - 02:20 too interesting if you invest in stocks as we've explained before you have to compound it for 5 years 7 years 10 Time: 02:20 - 02:30 years that's also boring but with intraday something interesting can happen you will look at it and it will Time: 02:30 - 02:40 feel like you can make a lot of money with a small amount of capital and let me show this to you with an actual example this is daber now first let's look at it from the perspective of a Time: 02:40 - 02:50 long-term investment this is not investment advice I'm just trying to show you what long-term versus intraday looks like and also why intraday is a problem so in D the stock is trading at Time: 02:50 - 03:00 about 650 rupe so let me do one thing let me show you the funds in my account I have 12,7 rupees in my account right now Time: 03:00 - 03:10 which means I can only buy 12,000 rupees worth of shares for the long term so let's see what that looks like I will open dber shares I'll open the buy so Time: 03:10 - 03:20 this buy order basically shows that I'm going to buy dber on this exchange it's one quantity and the amount is $650 three amount is like you guessed you pay Time: 03:20 - 03:30 this to get one share of dber so since I have 12,000 let me change this to say I guess 15 and uh refresh it and I'll see Time: 03:30 - 03:40 that it shows 9,800 9,800 I have 9,800 that means for the long term I can spend 9,800 and buy this Time: 03:40 - 03:50 stock for a longterm investment but now let me switch from long-term to Mis and Mis means intraday let's see what Time: 03:50 - 04:00 happens and keep your eye on that amount area which says 9,800 right now so I'll change it to intraday see that it's become Time: 04:00 - 04:10 1,900 so let me get this straight if I want to invest long-term 15 shares all I can buy but if I want to intraday trade Time: 04:10 - 04:20 15 shares only costs me or requires a margin of 1,961 This Means since I have 12,000 rupees I can can trade with more right Time: 04:20 - 04:30 so let me change this to 90 okay 90 quantity so 90 shares if I trade I will require Time: 04:30 - 04:40 11,746 which otherwise would have required a lot more money for an investor but for a Trader instead of trading just 15 I can trade with 90 which means my profit will also be Time: 04:40 - 04:50 larger and so will my losses but it doesn't matter Traders especially beginners are big optimist so let me place an order and actually buy this Time: 04:50 - 05:00 stock I place this order and I'm going to the order window and I can see the dber has been placed and you can see why Time: 05:00 - 05:10 this leverage increases your profit multifold if the market goes on your side but you know what that is precisely the problem if this stock Falls by just Time: 05:10 - 05:20 1% and I am 10 times leveraged I will lose 10 times me more just because your Time: 05:20 - 05:30 broker allows you leverage doesn't mean you should use it Leverage is a double-edged sword that beginner should not touch now imagine this on one side Time: 05:30 - 05:40 if you had taken a long-term investment with 15 shares and on the other side you had done this intraday trade with 90 shares and let's say darber moved up in Time: 05:40 - 05:50 our favor by 10 Rupees in just a few minutes 10 rupes multiplied by 90 would be 900 rupes profit in in just a few Time: 05:50 - 06:00 minutes and over here it would be just 150 rupe so you can see clearly why people think less time less Capital very exciting very spicy boring compounding Time: 06:00 - 06:10 old people do this the difference is massive people think that they can make small amounts of money really quickly but imagine if Time: 06:10 - 06:20 just the opposite happened it fell 20 30 40 rupees what would happen to this trade also imagine that you were doing Time: 06:20 - 06:30 this with a larger Capital like 1 lakh or 2 lakh could you really lose 10% 20% in just a few minutes the answer is yes you could the second expectation that Time: 06:30 - 06:40 you'll be sold on the internet and by all these people is guaranteed returns now here how this story goes people will Time: 06:40 - 06:50 say if the market goes up an intraday Trader can make money if the market goes down through something called Short Selling and intraday Trader can make Time: 06:50 - 07:00 money if markets fall too now I remember around 2008 or 9 I met this one uncle and he said beta I think you know if you Time: 07:00 - 07:10 learn a little bit of analysis trading can be very simple I said okay Uncle what's your point he said very simple I Time: 07:10 - 07:20 know that this company moves 10 Rupees every day I've been watching it for a while every day it moves 10 Rupees with some Capital that I have I'll buy 1,000 Time: 07:20 - 07:30 shares whether I go long or short doesn't matter because move as soon as it moves 1 rupee in my favor I'll exit and make 1,000 rupees and I'll do this a Time: 07:30 - 07:40 few times in the day and I'll walk with 5 to 6,000 rupees a day I am a simple man I just need 5 6K a day times 20 days Time: 07:40 - 07:50 I'll trade I'll make some money I'm happy that's my strategy that's not a strategy that's a Time: 07:50 - 08:00 bankruptcy plan and I'll explain how one the costs of trading are more than you think you will pay government tax if you Time: 08:00 - 08:10 make a profit you'll pay income tax if you enter you have to pay transaction taxes so your entry if it's at 100 it's not 100 it's 100 plus expenses which Time: 08:10 - 08:20 means that the market needs to move a little more in your favor now for you to make that profit third you have to predict the D ction of the market now we Time: 08:20 - 08:30 always imagine the markets are going sideways all the time and we will make 1 one1 1,000 rupees and it'll add up to a lack by the end of the month this does not happen here is what's actually going Time: 08:30 - 08:40 to happen you will take a long trade you will wait for 1 Rupees to go up for you to make that 1,000 but that day the Time: 08:40 - 08:50 market will reverse and fall 30 rupes and you will lose 30,000 rupe you will do this again and lose another 30 ,000 rupes wiping away any gains that you Time: 08:50 - 09:00 made before that yes I said gains it's possible for you to make money sometimes when you do this but 1 2 three bad Time: 09:00 - 09:10 trades will wipe away everything and take away that Capital 2 so now let's come to point number three the magic strategy basically you will get one Time: 09:10 - 09:20 strategy online or you can read a book and you'll feel like you figured something out let me show you an example of what a strategy looks like so what Time: 09:20 - 09:30 I'm going to do is I'm going to open a 10-minute chart of dber choosing this stock completely randomly and I've added the magic moving average over here this Time: 09:30 - 09:40 magic moving average is orange in color and it's a 100 moving average what it is is it's tracking the average movement of daber over the last 100 bars each bar is Time: 09:40 - 09:50 10 minutes long now all you need to do is look at it whenever the price comes close to the the orange line after some Time: 09:50 - 10:00 time it bounces back see over here it's bounced back over here it's bounced back over here it's bounced back over here it's bounced back so all you need to do is track when the market comes close to Time: 10:00 - 10:10 this then once it starts moving up you buy it and you'll make money on the way up like look at this over here on this day from the orange line all the way Time: 10:10 - 10:20 here the market moved up a full 2% but let's look at it a little closer here you'll notice the market came down down you would have bought it Time: 10:20 - 10:30 here but the market fell completely now you'll think that the market went up but it's intraday actually the day ended so you would have had to close your position and the market well gave you a Time: 10:30 - 10:40 loss so this would have been a loss trade the market gapped up went all the way up there was no way for you for you to enter because it just moved very Time: 10:40 - 10:50 quickly and you missed the entire move the same thing happens again and again until you see a sideways Market the market touch is the orange line what Time: 10:50 - 11:00 multiple times during the day you would have tried to enter multiple times and gotten nowhere so looking at this strategy from Time: 11:00 - 11:10 afar looks really good but executing it intraday changes a lot of things the market can just Gap up it can Gap Down News will affect it but the amazing Time: 11:10 - 11:20 thing about a magic strategy is it will always feel like if you make money you'll feel like a king and if you lose Time: 11:20 - 11:30 money it'll feel like you just didn't analyze enough maybe if you add one more rule one more technicality next time you'll be able to catch the trend the Time: 11:30 - 11:40 final expectation is probability if you understand this you'll understand the entire game of money now you'll think a Trader a successful Trader probably Time: 11:40 - 11:50 makes money 9 out of 10 times this is not true most Traders make money 50/50 or 40 60 which means 40 trades make Time: 11:50 - 12:00 money 60 trades lose money so that's 1 2 3 4 and they lose the rest of the times it could also be that they're Time: 12:00 - 12:10 making money only three times out of 10 but the difference is when they make money they make a little more than how much they Time: 12:10 - 12:20 actually lose and just that difference of how much they make makes all the difference and this is called a risk reward ratio so they make a little more money then they lose so 1 is to two or 1 Time: 12:20 - 12:30 is to three is quite common but that difference is how they actually make cash now understand this in trading you Time: 12:30 - 12:40 have to take multiple trades and be right many many times and every time you write you'll accumulate that into a profit now let's compare this to say Time: 12:40 - 12:50 Warren Buffett's portfolio War bit's portfolio is very different he may have a worse loss rate than this he would have probably Time: 12:50 - 13:00 invested in many many stocks over his entire lifetime but a few of these stocks earned him all this money just like that so what's the bottom line can Time: 13:00 - 13:10 you make money from Trading the answer is yes just like any other profession if you spend loads of money time effort to figure it out of course you can all Time: 13:10 - 13:20 these hedge funds over here actually make money from Trading but they don't approach it as a getrich scheme they treat it as a business mathematics ially figure out how the market works and make Time: 13:20 - 13:30 money over a period of time [Music] Time: 13:30 - 13:40 14:20 I noticed a tinge of sadness when Pratik said “there are very companies who try to deinfluence you”. I can feel his pain — putting in so much time & effort into making videos & all these new-age finfluencers get more views, likes & shares. The importance of this series can’t be gauged in views & likes alone. It goes far beyond that.",
