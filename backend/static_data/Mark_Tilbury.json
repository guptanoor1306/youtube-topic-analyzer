      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:12 a day working from home. Are dollars a day from this side hustle. I mean, figure $400,000 Time: 00:12 - 00:19 this month alone. Apparently, anyone can do this from anywhere in the world, but is this too good to be true? Well, today, I wanna put it to the test by only using free tools to make a Shopify store and see how many products I can sell online, but I'm setting myself three rules. Number one, I must use free AI tools and keep the total cost of the shop creation Time: 00:19 - 00:42 to under $1. Number two, I have to be able to do it all from my laptop. And number three, I need to finish it in less than an hour. Okay. Time: 00:43 - 00:52 Start the timer. Time: 00:52 - 00:53 Right. I've got a list of steps to complete. The first thing on my plan is to find a free AI tool to create our Shopify store. Now Time: 00:55 - 01:03 I've done quite a lot of searching around, and the best one I found is build your store. It claims to be able to build a Shopify store for us and lets us sell other people's products without needing our own inventory Time: 01:04 - 01:15 or doing any of the work ourselves. The idea is when the store receives an order, the product is shipped directly to the customer, which allows us to make a profit without any more work on our end. If you wanna follow along, feel free to head down to the description of the video and click the top link. So I've loaded up page, and, now I'm gonna click this button here that says build my free store because Time: 01:16 - 01:39 that's exactly what we want it to do. Now they're asking for my full name, which is, of course, Mark Time: 01:40 - 01:45 Tilbury, Time: 01:45 - 01:46 and they want an email address. Time: 01:46 - 01:48 And to pick a password Time: 01:50 - 01:52 Right. That's done, and then just click next. Now it's asking me to choose a niche. You have six options here to choose from, fashion and apparel, pets, electronics and gadgets, home and garden, Time: 01:53 - 02:05 sports and fitness, and finally, an option for, I'm not sure. Lots of people would just pick something they're interested in. However, it's best to approach this with a business mind and think to yourself, what do you confidently Time: 02:05 - 02:17 know that has a large market? Honestly, Time: 02:17 - 02:20 all of these options are pretty good. However, I'm just gonna go for sport and fitness because Time: 02:20 - 02:26 my son is always at boxing or running or in the gym. So I'm pretty sure there's a big demand for these types of products, especially amongst younger people. I've even heard that Gen Z are now meeting people at running clubs instead of nightclubs. Time: 02:26 - 02:39 Very different from back in my day. That's for sure. Right. Time: 02:39 - 02:42 That's the first one off my list. The next thing on my list is to customize the store and make it appealing to our customers. Time: 02:43 - 02:49 Now there are six banners on here to choose from. So let's go through them and find out what suits our store best. The first one has a lot of different sporting items, which Time: 02:50 - 03:00 may seem good. But if we don't end up selling those products, it could confuse our customers, so we'll skip that one. Then there's this one with just a woman on her own. While it's a nice design, it doesn't really represent our entire audience, and we want our store to appeal to both men and women. So using this logic, Time: 03:00 - 03:18 the bottom right one also feels, well, Time: 03:18 - 03:21 a bit too female only, so we'll pass on that. So out of these remaining three, I think the bottom left one works great, and the middle right one pops really nicely with the sunset, which could help grab attention and create a positive first impression. Remember, the banners are the first thing our customers will see when they land on our store, so it's important they reflect what we're about and what we're offering. Time: 03:22 - 03:43 If you don't feel like any of these work for you, then don't worry because you can always change them later on. Now that we've chosen our banners, let's hit continue Time: 03:44 - 03:52 and move on to the next step. To let the AI build our store, we need to set up a free Shopify account. So that's the next thing on my list. The first thing I'm gonna do is click on access Shopify, Time: 03:52 - 04:04 which opens up in a new tab. Now I'm gonna type in my email address Time: 04:05 - 04:09 and then hit start free trial. Then I just need to pick a password Time: 04:12 - 04:16 and click create Shopify account. Now as you can see, Shopify is now asking us a few setup questions. But since AI is gonna handle most of the work for us, we can just select, I don't want help setting up to save us time. Now it's asking us to choose a plan for when the free trial ends. The basic plan looks good enough for what we're building as it's designed for solo entrepreneurs, Time: 04:18 - 04:41 and it's also the most popular option. So I'm just gonna go ahead and select that one. Then I'll quickly add in my payment details so we're all ready when the trial ends. But don't worry right now because it's completely free. And after the trial, it's just £1 or $1 per month for the first three months. As we're not paying anything right now, this doesn't count towards our $1 budget. I know we'll probably have to pay it before we get some sales in, but, technically, I haven't paid it yet. So I think you can let me off with this one. Once that's all set up, Shopify takes us to this dashboard for our new store where we can manage everything. Now Time: 04:42 - 05:18 it does look pretty confusing, but that's fine as we won't have too much to do in here ourselves because soon, the AI will be taking control. That sounded pretty scary. I hope this AI stuff doesn't lead us into a terminator situation. Now we need to install the build your store app. This might seem like it's getting a bit confusing, but after this, it gets a whole lot easier. So I'm gonna click access Shopify again, which opens another tab. Time: 05:19 - 05:45 On this page, I'm gonna click the install button to add the app to our Shopify account. Time: 05:45 - 05:51 With this done, I can click create my custom store. Now we just need to give the AI a bit of time to work its magic and build a store website first in the background. Time: 05:51 - 06:01 We'll check out the results later to see what it's created, but for now, let's keep things moving and jump on to the next step. Right. The next thing on my list is to find some winning products for our store. Time: 06:01 - 06:11 This is so important because the right products can make or break the store. They attract customers, drive sales, and ultimately Time: 06:12 - 06:19 set us apart from our competition. To make this as easy and efficient as possible, we're gonna register for AutoDS. Time: 06:20 - 06:26 This tool does the heavy lifting for us by selecting products that are proven to sell. It also takes care of pricing, Time: 06:27 - 06:34 uploading professional photos, and once we start making sales, it'll also ship the products directly to our customers. I'm going to go back to the build your store website and select register to auto d s. This gives us the option to either sign up with a Google account or to enter your details manually. Time: 06:34 - 06:52 Just make sure that you use the same email address you use for Shopify and build your store to keep everything linked. Time: 06:52 - 06:59 Okay. So now it's asking me, where will we be selling? So, of course, I'm choosing Time: 07:00 - 07:05 Shopify. Time: 07:05 - 07:06 Now we need to pick the right plan. AutoDS offers the first thirty days for just 99¢ Time: 07:07 - 07:12 on any plan. This gives us a chance to test everything out and see how well it works. In my opinion, the basic plan doesn't have enough features to make this truly passive, but we don't need the advanced plan yet either. The starter 500 plan looks perfect for what we need, so I'm selecting Time: 07:12 - 07:29 start now for 99¢. Time: 07:29 - 07:31 There are a few different payment methods available. Time: 07:31 - 07:34 I'm gonna go with PayPal as I always use it. Right. So there we go. Time: 07:34 - 07:39 All sorted. Time: 07:40 - 07:41 And just like that, that's my $1 budget officially spent. Hopefully, there's nothing else left to pay for while setting up this store because at this point, I've only got 1¢ left. Now it's finally time to publish our store. I'm actually quite excited to see everything come together. The last thing we need to do here is to click access Shopify and then uncheck the box that says restrict access to visitors with a password. Time: 07:41 - 08:05 Now that's done. I'm gonna press continue Time: 08:05 - 08:08 and Time: 08:09 - 08:09 boom. Our store is officially live with winning products. Now that our Shopify store is live, the next thing on my list is to take a proper look and make any tweaks we might need before sending customers over there. This actually looks a lot better than I thought it would. Our two banners were in place, and the ai ai has set up buttons that lead straight to the new product arrivals page, which should make it easy for customers to get around the site. Down here are some of the winning products that AutoDS Time: 08:10 - 08:37 has added for us. First, we have what looks like some kind of breathing trainer. Time: 08:37 - 08:42 Actually, I have seen my son use one of these before. It works kinda like high altitude training by limiting the amount of oxygen you can take in. I think the idea is that when you're in a competition, your body can carry more oxygen in your blood, which should make you perform better. To be honest, the more I'm talking about it, the more I want one for myself. So I think this will sell really, really well. Next, we've got bag clips for your golf club. Now I personally use these all the time because they stop the clubs rattling together and getting damaged. And if you've ever had to replace a carbon shaft, you know how expensive that can be. Then we have the classic resistance band, which Time: 08:43 - 09:19 I imagine is always a good seller, and a warm jogging hat to round things off as it's getting a little bit chilly this time of year. So, honestly, Time: 09:20 - 09:27 I'm pretty impressed with the items it's picked. But if we did wanna pick more, then it's pretty simple to do that too. I just have to head over to AutoDS, Time: 09:28 - 09:36 click marketplace, Time: 09:37 - 09:37 and then trending products. Time: 09:38 - 09:40 Now this brings up a page with all the products that are selling very, very well, and we could pick any of these even if they don't necessarily fit with our niche. To be honest, though, it's probably not a good idea to be too random with it as your customers need to know what your store is about. So I'm gonna click on this filter for sports and fitness, and it pulls up some products that would fit really well into our store. Time: 09:41 - 10:04 Now if I wanted to add one of these, then all I'd have to do is click import draft Time: 10:05 - 10:09 and then wait for the import of the product. Then it gives me the option to adjust all the information and photos before publishing it onto the store. Time: 10:09 - 10:18 Now I'm pretty impressed so far, but let's dive a bit deeper and check out what our product page looks like and see if we can spot any mistakes we need to fix. Let's click on the golf club clips. Now there is a decent selection of product photos, and to be fair, Time: 10:18 - 10:33 they do look quite professional. Time: 10:34 - 10:35 There's also quite a wide range of different shots, which is important because when I'm buying something, I always like to look at a few different photos. According to AutoDS, Time: 10:35 - 10:45 these golf clips cost me $6.84, Time: 10:45 - 10:49 And dropshippers normally sell their items for two to two and a half times their cost. So I should be able to sell these for at least $13.68, Time: 10:49 - 10:58 which would give us $6.84 Time: 10:58 - 11:01 profit per sale, not taking into account any marketing cost. Now I'll be honest. That's not a crazy amount of money. But when you're selling at scale, it could definitely start to add up. Plus, if I think these clips could sell for more than $13, Time: 11:01 - 11:16 I can always bump up the price manually and see how it goes. One small detail I really like on here is the little animation on the PayPal button. Now I've always found that having PayPal payments available on my website adds a bit more trust and often improves sales. The AI has even written the product descriptions for us and thrown in some emojis. I'll admit, Time: 11:16 - 11:37 that is handy and saves a lot of time, which I am a bit short of right now. It's also included related product suggestions at the bottom of each page, which could help with upselling. I admit, it's fairly basic, but I found that basic websites often perform better. This footer is actually a bit of a surprise. I wasn't expecting much here because let's be honest, footers are usually an afterthought, but the AI has done a decent job with it. All the important pages are already set up, like the shipping policies and terms and conditions. Time: 11:37 - 12:08 These little details might not seem like a big deal, but they do make the store look a lot more professional. Now let me click into the terms and conditions page and take a look. Time: 12:09 - 12:19 Yep. Most of the heavy lifting's already been done. All I need to do is drop in a store name, our location, and some contact details to finish off. Now the only thing letting the store down right now is the domain name. It's just a random jumble of characters, and, honestly, it doesn't scream professional. Time: 12:19 - 12:36 A good domain name is so important because it's the first thing customers see. So I'm gonna head back to Build Your Store AI to sort that out. I'm gonna set up a .store Time: 12:36 - 12:47 domain instead of a .com Time: 12:47 - 12:49 because it's specifically designed for online stores. There has actually been studies that show websites with a .store domain get 87% Time: 12:49 - 12:56 more traffic are ranked two times higher on Google. Time: 12:56 - 12:59 So using a domain like this should actually help us sell more. Time: 12:59 - 13:03 When you think about it, this makes sense because when someone sees a .store domain, they know right away they're visiting a shop. Luckily, we can get a .store domain for free as we're using the build your store AI tool. However, if you aren't using this, then you can also buy one from sites like GoDaddy and Namecheap. Let's go with something simple like Time: 13:03 - 13:24 Tilbury Time: 13:24 - 13:25 Fitness because, Time: 13:26 - 13:27 let's face it, I have the body of a Greek god, and, obviously, everyone wants to look like me. Now I've got to link the domain name to the store, so I'm gonna press connect now and enter the new domain name here. Now it will take a few moments to verify, and then we're ready to go. Before we officially start selling, I'm gonna spend my last bit of time left on the clock to tweak the website. Stuff like filling in the footer details, linking some social media accounts, and making sure everything looks polished. Time: 13:27 - 13:57 There we go. All done and just in time. Now it's time to move on to the exciting part, promoting the store and getting those first sales in. Time: 13:59 - 14:08 Okay. So it's a couple of days later now as I needed some time to order a couple of the products. Time: 14:09 - 14:14 The next thing on my list is to advertise our store. So to get some eyeballs on our store, I've decided to work with some influencers. Time: 14:14 - 14:21 Now Gymshark has proved this strategy works very well in the fitness niche, and it's great because I'll get a positive endorsement from a trusted figure and traffic to my store. So it's essentially killing two birds with one stone. But don't worry. I'm not gonna be spending thousands of dollars working with huge influencers. Time: 14:22 - 14:40 I've got a much better plan. Time: 14:40 - 14:42 I'm gonna use Time: 14:42 - 14:43 micro influencers. Time: 14:44 - 14:45 These are accounts with anywhere from 10 to 50,000 Time: 14:45 - 14:49 followers, whereas macro influencers are accounts with 500,000 Time: 14:49 - 14:53 to a million followers. So what does that make me then? Super macro? That is terrible. Time: 14:53 - 14:58 I'm not Time: 14:59 - 15:00 I'm not doing this just to save costs. According to social bakers, micro influencers boast up to a 60% increased engagement rate compared to macro influencers. Micro influencers Time: 15:01 - 15:12 also have a 20% Time: 15:12 - 15:14 plus higher conversion rate. This can help brands boost their ecommerce sales. That sounds perfect for what we need. So I've reached out to a couple of lads I know called the Grays Brothers. They've been making short videos for a couple of years now and have around 14,500 Time: 15:14 - 15:30 followers on Instagram. Time: 15:30 - 15:31 They do have more on other platforms, but I'm more interested in Instagram because I want them to post a story with a link. I could also get them to promote the other products. But first, I wanna test out if their audience will actually buy before risking any more money. And who knows? People might even explore the shop and buy other items without me having to promote them directly. I approved their script yesterday, and they've just sent me the final video. But before we have a look, let's do a bit of quality check on the items I ordered. This is the breathing trainer, and it feels pretty damn good and built to last. I think my son might even take it for himself. But, seriously, it's always good to know that the quality is good because the last thing we want is unhappy customers wanting refunds. Time: 15:31 - 16:16 Okay. So we also have the hat Time: 16:16 - 16:18 nice and woolly. That should keep nice and warm. I like the fact it's got a peak on it. Very stylish. Can't be bad. Time: 16:19 - 16:25 And the gold clips, Time: 16:26 - 16:27 do you know what? Time: 16:28 - 16:29 They are really good. They are better quality. Because my ones slip off, and they've got a lot more power behind them. So I think I'll be having those for myself. Time: 16:30 - 16:38 And then a resistance band, they're always popular. So I think we should be on to a winner with those. Right. Let's take a look at the video. What are you doing? Time: 16:39 - 16:48 I'm just wearing my respirator. Time: 16:48 - 16:50 Respirator? Time: 16:50 - 16:51 You're in a gym, not a hospital, mate. But it's improving my cardio. What are you on about? The breathing training respirator restricts your breathing, which increases your red blood cell count, helping you improve your cardio. Buy it today using the link in the bio. Well, that's definitely a bit wacky, but that's part of the charm. It's quick, attention grabbing, and shows off the breathing trainer in action, which is exactly what we needed. That high energy, slightly off the wall style works really well on Instagram stories because it stops people from skipping and pulls them in. Even though it's not the most traditional approach, it fits the Grays Brothers audience perfectly. Time: 16:51 - 17:27 Their followers love this kind of content, and it feels so natural coming from them. I'm gonna get them to put this story up with a link to the product page and check back tomorrow. So let's hope we make some sales. Time: 17:27 - 17:39 So it's been twenty four hours, and I've got some exciting news. We've made some sales. Now it doesn't seem like my approach of only promoting one product really worked as people didn't buy anything else. But as of today, Time: 17:40 - 17:53 we've sold 12 of these breathing trainers. Okay. Two of those sales were technically me for testing, of course, but the other 10 will achieve. So not counting my two orders, 10 genuine purchases for £13.42 Time: 17:53 - 18:06 is a hundred and £34.20, Time: 18:06 - 18:10 and converted to US dollars is a hundred and $70.85. Time: 18:10 - 18:14 But, of course, not all of that is profit. The items cost me an average of $3.95 Time: 18:14 - 18:20 each. So $39.50 Time: 18:20 - 18:23 went towards product costs and shipping. Time: 18:23 - 18:25 As AutoDS shipped all the orders for us, we didn't need to worry about anything. After factoring in the $50 I paid the Grays Brothers and the $1 Shopify fee after our three day trial ran out, our total cost came to $90.50. Time: 18:25 - 18:41 That leaves us with a profit of Time: 18:42 - 18:44 $80.35. Time: 18:44 - 18:46 Now I know $80 might not sound life changing, but let's put this into perspective. This was all done with minimal effort using AI tools and a budget of just $1 to set everything up and $50 for marketing. Now imagine scaling this. If we promoted 20 products and they kept ticking along making regular sales, this could easily turn into thousands of dollars in profit Time: 18:46 - 19:10 every month. If you'd like to see a follow-up video in the future, be sure to give this one a thumbs up. Of course, before I post this, I'll need to change the name of the store to make sure no one stumbles across the site and starts buying products as that wouldn't make it a fair test. If you wanna see more ideas for making passive income, I've got another video right up there. But don't click on it just yet. Make sure to subscribe if you wanna grow your wealth. Okay? I'll see you over there. Time: 19:11 - 19:36Investors should keep their money active, especially in 2025 as markets diversify. With recent stock gains, my $460k portfolio seems best suited for stocks—the smartest investment option. Others likely agree.",

      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:13 While it might have been true in my time, it's not the reality anymore. Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying that studying is a waste of time. Many degrees are very useful, and the student experience is unforgettable. Time: 00:13 - 00:25 However, relying solely on a degree to make you rich isn't the right approach. That's why it's so important for students to start some kind of side hustle that has the ability to grow into something much bigger in the future. Look. I wasn't wealthy enough to be able to afford university or probably academically smart enough, but I always had side hustles. Ultimately, my side hustles turned into multimillion dollar businesses and made me a millionaire. Time: 00:25 - 00:51 That's why today, I'm gonna dive into seven side hustles students can start this year. To be honest, these can actually apply to anyone, anywhere in the world. And because I hate those silly videos that just regurgitate the same list of side hustle ideas, I'm actually gonna share real life examples of people smashing it and rate them out of five in these important categories. How much time it takes to learn, how much money you need, and how difficult it is to make a thousand dollars per month. Side hustle idea number one, faceless short form content. This is Daniel Bitton. Like many of you, he started using social media for fun at the age of 13. Time: 00:52 - 01:30 Now at 16, Time: 01:30 - 01:31 he's earning half a million dollars every single month creating short form content on Snap Time: 01:32 - 01:37 without even showing his face. It sounds unbelievable, but it's completely true. My son Curtis actually bumped into him at LAX Airport. And after doing some research, I can assure you he's not capping. So why can you make so much money doing this? Well, at the moment, there's a huge war going on between Snapchat, YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok. During the pandemic, TikTok became so popular and grabbed the attention of the world. Since then, all the different social media platforms have been competing for this attention as the more eyes they have on their app, the more money they can make from advertisers. Time: 01:37 - 02:11 Stick with me because this is where it all starts coming together. The one thing these platforms need more than anything else is content creators. And what attracts the best creators better than anything else? Money, Time: 02:11 - 02:22 because we all like a little bit of that. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. Time: 02:23 - 02:27 But once a platform is established at the top, competition will decrease Time: 02:27 - 02:31 along with the payouts. So you'll need to jump in on this one quickly if you wanna be making close to half a million dollars a month, just like Daniel. The people that are paid the most are those that create original content rather than just cutting up other people's content from YouTube. Daniel does this by using existing videos, but then adding different voiceovers, Time: 02:31 - 02:50 music, and edits. Time: 02:50 - 02:52 This strategy combined with consistent posting led to extreme growth. He then expanded with multiple channels in various niches to attract diverse audiences. Time: 02:52 - 03:01 So for example, one of his channels is about rapper updates, and the others is focused on live streamers. Now for those important ratings, I'll give this a four out of five. Although making short clips may seem quick and easy, there's a lot more that goes into it than you might first think. Saying this, if you regularly watch TikTok or Shorts, then you'll be better prepared than most. Creating short form clips is a lot more about understanding human psychology than it is about fancy editing. If you can create a great hook and build towards some kind of payoff at the end, you'll increase the watch time. This is the only trick you need to know if you want your videos to go viral and earn you lots of money. Trust me, I've managed to get 7,000,000 followers on TikTok using this exact strategy. The best way to teach yourself this is to watch short form content on a daily basis. Time: 03:02 - 03:50 Make it part of your routine. This might sound different from what many people my age will tell you, but I'm not talking about using it for entertainment. Time: 03:50 - 03:57 Every time you stop and watch a short, I want you to ask yourself a simple question. What intrigued me enough to stop scrolling and watch the whole thing? Make a list in your notes app, and before you know it, you'll have a ton of different winning ideas. Time: 03:58 - 04:12 Secondly, how much money do you need? I'll give this Time: 04:12 - 04:15 one out of five. Because if you have a phone and an Internet connection, then you can get started. And if you're watching this video, then I'd assume you've got both of those things. Thirdly, how easy is it to make a thousand dollars per month? I'll give this a one out of five. As I mentioned, social media platforms are handing out cash like there's no tomorrow. Just think, to make a thousand dollars a month, all you'd have to do is be naught point two percent as good as Daniel. Now if you don't think that's achievable, Time: 04:16 - 04:44 then you need to believe in yourself a bit more. Idea two, investing. A lot of people are gonna disagree with me on this one as it's technically not a side hustle. Time: 04:45 - 04:54 However, it makes me around about $17,000 Time: 04:54 - 04:57 per week, so I thought it was definitely worth a mention. It's taken me a lot of years to build up to that. However, I've managed to do it all on my own without a financial advisor charging me commission on every investment. It's really not as complicated as people make out. Of course, I'm not a financial advisor, and investments can go up as well as down, but my dollar cost averaging strategy has worked wonders for me over the years. This is when you consistently buy into the market, no matter if it's high or low. Over Time: 04:57 - 05:21 is that the price you buy the stock at Time: 05:26 - 05:28 averages out. You can do this with pretty much any stock you want. However, Time: 05:29 - 05:33 the real secret weapon has to be index funds. If you were to invest $200 Time: 05:33 - 05:38 a month for forty years and get an average return of 10% per year, then you have over Time: 05:38 - 05:44 $1,200,000 Time: 05:44 - 05:46 I know what you're thinking. How on earth am I gonna make a 10% return? You're out of touch, old man. Well, of course, past results are no guarantee of future returns. However, over the last ten years, the average annual return of the S and P five hundred was 11%. Time: 05:46 - 06:03 Okay. But I don't wanna wait forty years to become a millionaire. This is exactly how you should be thinking. I didn't wanna wait until I was old and gray either. I went out and made quick money through my side hustles, Time: 06:03 - 06:15 started a business, and made millions, Time: 06:15 - 06:17 all while investing around half of my earnings and multiplying it in the stock market. It's not a choice between one or the other. You really should consider doing both at the same time. Now let's get on to the ratings. Oh, I've forgotten the photo. Time: 06:17 - 06:31 Let's use that one. Firstly, how much time does investing take to learn? I'll give this a one out of five because as I said, the basics are extremely simple. I've got multiple videos on my channel breaking down the core concepts like passive income, the different types of accounts to open, and my favorite, Time: 06:31 - 06:49 index funds. Once you master the tricky words, you'll see that it's really simple, especially with different investment apps allowing you to automate your investments Time: 06:50 - 06:58 every single month. So you don't even have to think about them. My favorite for this kind of thing is trading two one two. So I reached out to them to see if they'd be interested in sponsoring this section in the video. They agreed and are also offering a free stock worth up to a hundred pound to anyone that uses the code tilbury when they create an account and deposit as little as £1. If you're a beginner, then definitely check out their pies feature, as you can have a look at what other people are investing their money in, and then either create your own pie or just copy theirs. You can then set it to auto invest for you as often as you like, and your money will be split between the different stocks in your pie. Secondly, how much money do you need? I'll give this a one out of five because you can start with as little as $1 I don't suggest you put all of your money into stocks, though. Make sure you're investing it back into your side hustle as well. And thirdly, how easy is it to make a thousand dollars per month? I'll give this a one out of five. As for me, I don't have to do anything. It's just easy. However, it took me a lot of years of consistency Time: 06:59 - 08:01 to get to this stage. In my opinion, investing should always be paired with a side hustle that generates you fast money. Side hustle idea three, Time: 08:01 - 08:10 Discord building. This is Chris Peters, and he's on track to make $15,000 Time: 08:11 - 08:17 a month from building and managing Time: 08:17 - 08:19 Discord servers. And he's only 19 years old. I remember first chatting with Chris a couple of years ago. He must have been about 17 at the time. I had just started my free Discord group and had absolutely Time: 08:19 - 08:31 no idea what I was doing. He messaged me and offered to help me for free. So I took him up on that offer, and he completely revamped my server. By the way, I am still running the free Discord group, and I'll drop a link in the description below if you wanna join us. Over the years, I've been more and more impressed with Chris's work ethic and quick thinking. So it's fair to say, I'm not letting him work for free anymore. If you don't know, Discord is basically this all in one communication hub with text, voice, and video chats. It started off just for gamers, but now it's pretty versatile, used by all sorts of communities and businesses. There's a huge opportunity here because as the usage of Discord increases, there are people like me a few years ago who have no idea how to operate it. It's complex enough to confuse a beginner, particularly those of an older generation, Time: 08:32 - 09:23 but simple enough for a youngster to learn in a short amount of time. I mean, Chris started his Discord business while he was still at school, sitting his GCSE Time: 09:24 - 09:32 exams, and I was one of his first clients. Just remember to offer huge value upfront before asking for any kind of payment. Time: 09:32 - 09:39 If you do good work and make yourself indispensable, Time: 09:40 - 09:43 you'll start earning big. Now it's time for those ratings. Time: 09:43 - 09:46 Firstly, how much time does Discord take to learn? I'd give this a two and a half out of five, as you can get to grips with the basics in a couple of hours. However, to do the really complicated stuff, it may take a bit longer depending on how tech savvy you are. I asked Chris for his top tip for learning Discord skills, and he said it's important to join multiple communities. Time: 09:47 - 10:10 This way, you can know what makes a successful Time: 10:10 - 10:13 server. Secondly, how much money do you need? I'd rate this a one out of five. You can get started with just your computer. Time: 10:13 - 10:20 Although finding clients, planning community features, and customizing the Discord servers to fit your client's niche may take time. In the early days, you should be able to manage all of this stuff yourself. Thirdly, how easy is it to make a thousand dollars per month? I'd rate this a one out of five. Let's look at the numbers. Now assuming you can find four clients and put them on a monthly retainer, Time: 10:20 - 10:42 you'd only have to charge them $250 Time: 10:42 - 10:45 each, and boom, that's a thousand dollars a month right there. And honestly, Time: 10:45 - 10:49 if you find the right clients, you should be able to charge them much more than this. Side hustle idea four, Time: 10:49 - 10:55 online coaching. This is Jack Jefferson. Time: 10:56 - 10:59 He decided to quit his $70,000 Time: 10:59 - 11:02 9 to five in London to pursue his online fitness coaching side hustle full time as it had started generating him $7,000 Time: 11:02 - 11:11 a month. Now you may be thinking that's only $14,000 Time: 11:11 - 11:14 more than his full time job in London. However, now he has something even more valuable, Time: 11:14 - 11:19 freedom. He can now operate his side hustle from anywhere in the world as long as he has an Internet connection so he can check-in with his clients and review their progress. Jefferson Training now has over 40 clients and is growing by the month. I get that not everyone is a gym expert, and this might seem a little niche. However, notice how the title of this idea isn't online fitness coaching. It's online Time: 11:20 - 11:44 coaching. That's because there are countless things you can teach people online and get the same results as Jack. From my travels to Dubai and Miami recently, Time: 11:44 - 11:53 all the young millionaires I meet seem to be coming from the online coaching space. They all have some kind of info product, and they're earning thousands. Time: 11:54 - 12:02 It's honestly an Time: 12:02 - 12:04 absolute gold mine. I've only Time: 12:05 - 12:06 started to notice this recently as most of the millionaires I've bumped into before this had their own physical products, like me, with my range of radio controlled models. The world is absolutely changing. People really value online support Time: 12:07 - 12:15 and absolutely changing. People really value online support and expertise. Time: 12:15 - 12:20 This industry Time: 12:21 - 12:22 just didn't exist when I was younger. Now it's time for those ratings. Firstly, how much time does online coaching take to learn? I'll give this a two out of five, because if you already have a skill people are willing to pay for, then all you need to learn is how to package it up and sell it. Once you've created this process, you can then rinse and repeat the formula. To get you thinking, here's what Jack does. He starts off by conducting an in-depth onboarding session to understand the needs and goals of each client. He then crafts personalized nutrition plans detailing Time: 12:22 - 12:54 breakfast, lunch, and dinner, alongside tailored fitness plans specifying both training Time: 12:55 - 13:00 and resting days. He then sets up regular check ins where he guides his clients through video feedback. I hope you can see how something like this can be easily adapted to lots of different types of coaching. I think the key to making good money relatively quickly is to offer degree of personalization Time: 13:01 - 13:17 rather than just selling an online course, as people are pretty sick of those. Secondly, how much money do you need? I'd rate this a one out of five, as all you need is your laptop, and you're good to go. Of course, this does assume you have some kind of skill you can teach. It might cost you a bit more if you have to learn a skill first. Thirdly, how easy is it to make a thousand dollars per month? I'd rate this a one out of five on the difficulty scale. As from what I've seen, this is incredibly easy. People are lazy. So although they could probably learn this stuff from a book, they don't wanna spend the time doing that. They would much rather spend some money and be spoon fed the information. Remember, people pay for convenience. Time: 13:18 - 13:58 Side hustle idea five, Time: 13:58 - 14:00 AI animation. This is Mercy. He's responsible for all the animations you see on my channel, and he's making 8 to $10,000 Time: 14:00 - 14:10 per month creating these for multiple clients. This side hustle is really interesting as AI is the biggest thing to happen to technology since the Internet. Just think how many billionaires that created. Despite the ongoing buzz, you might be surprised how few businesses have actually begun to use it. You see, there are five stages to technology adoption, and they look like this. First, you have the early innovators, which make up 2.5% Time: 14:10 - 14:37 of the people. They are the people that are willing to take a risk and go against the grain. They'd go out and buy the Samsung Fold or the new Apple Vision Pro on its first initial release. Time: 14:37 - 14:47 Second, we have the early adopters, Time: 14:47 - 14:50 making up 13.5% Time: 14:50 - 14:54 of the population. Time: 14:54 - 14:55 Similar to innovators, Time: 14:55 - 14:57 they're willing to take a risk. However, they prefer to test the product before forming an opinion and recommending it to others. Thirdly, we have the early majority, which is 34% Time: 14:57 - 15:07 of the population. Time: 15:07 - 15:08 These are the people that look at the product reviews before making a purchase. Time: 15:09 - 15:13 They want to see proof of it working before committing to it. This is a line where I believe we currently are with AI, at the very first stage of early majority adoption. This is followed by the late majority making up another 34%. Time: 15:13 - 15:28 And finally, the laggards, which is a surprising Time: 15:28 - 15:31 16%. Time: 15:32 - 15:33 When you get to my age, you'll find that most people are in the laggards category. Time: 15:33 - 15:37 Important thing. Whether you like it or not, AI will go through this cycle. So let me ask you this very simple question. Time: 15:43 - 15:51 Would you rather embrace it now or wait for everyone else to get the benefits and end up having to use it anyway? There are so many creative ways to use AI, but let's go back to Mercy for a solid example. He uses tools like chat GPT to help him script ideas out, and then uses Midjourney to bring his ideas to life. Let's get into the ratings. I'd give this a four out of five. Although AI can do a lot of the heavy lifting for you, Mercy still devoted months to mastering top notch animation skills, which helped him land clients and build relationships Time: 15:51 - 16:28 to keep the cash flowing in. So I'd recommend mastering the core principles of animation Time: 16:28 - 16:33 and actively Time: 16:34 - 16:34 participate in industry networks to keep refining your skills. Secondly, Time: 16:35 - 16:39 how much money do you need? I'd give this a one out of five. Because we're at an early stage in the adoption curve, it doesn't take a lot of expensive tools to stand out. When Mercy first started his side hustle, he managed to get featured on Andrew Tate's Instagram story because of some AI artwork he created. This gave him all the free promotion he needed to build a strong client base. This just shows that you don't need a lot of cash right now to make an impact. Thirdly, how easy is it to make a thousand dollars per month? I'd give this a two out of five. As online creators are getting more and more popular, there is more money flooding into the space. Creators wanna stand out. And by adding animations, Time: 16:40 - 17:22 it's a great way to make their videos look more premium and engaging. So get started now and get so far ahead that the late adopters Time: 17:22 - 17:31 can never catch you. Side hustle idea six, Time: 17:31 - 17:34 reselling Time: 17:35 - 17:35 luxury items. This is Ben Gallagher, a normal lad who started reselling luxury items online as a side hustle. In 2023, Time: 17:36 - 17:45 he generated Time: 17:45 - 17:46 £7,200,000 Time: 17:46 - 17:48 through his business, Luxe Collective, Time: 17:49 - 17:51 and even recently appeared on Dragon's Den, which is a bit like Shark Tank, and received investment from Steven Bartlett in exchange for a 3% Time: 17:51 - 18:00 equity stake. I'm so proud of how far he's come since appearing on my old podcast years ago. The luxury resale market soared to a whopping $39,230,000,000 Time: 18:00 - 18:12 in 2023. Time: 18:12 - 18:13 So it's no surprise that Ben is having so much success. The growing millennial population is driving a lot of this interest in luxury resale, Time: 18:13 - 18:22 Along with social media culture increasing the importance of Time: 18:22 - 18:25 flexing designer labels, reselling is a really cool side hustle as now with the internet, you're able to sell to anyone in the world, giving you access to a global marketplace. Time: 18:26 - 18:36 So let's look at the ratings. I'll give this a four out of five, as Ben spent countless hours learning how to identify fakes, Time: 18:37 - 18:46 learning about the market, and scouting for the best purchases. Ben looks out for items from brands like Louis Vuitton, Dior, Chanel, and even Hermes. Of course, you can imagine it's very important that he knows his stuff, as just one slip up could ruin his company's reputation. Ben has to carefully examine each bag for scent, Time: 18:46 - 19:05 stitching, Time: 19:06 - 19:06 material, and even send samples to a company in New York, which use microscopic Time: 19:07 - 19:11 technology Time: 19:12 - 19:12 to examine the exact structure of the materials used. So if you're passionate about designer items and are prepared to put the time into learning all the details, Time: 19:13 - 19:22 then it's worth a shot. Secondly, Time: 19:23 - 19:25 how much money do you need? I'd give this a 3.5 Time: 19:25 - 19:29 out of five as these designer items can be pretty pricey. Time: 19:29 - 19:33 I mean, some of these bags are worth up to $30,000, Time: 19:33 - 19:38 and that's the secondhand price. A lot of these high end bags tend to keep their value or maybe drop slightly. I mean, it's practically a designer bag stock market. Maybe that's why my son Curtis has bought his girlfriend so many bags, Time: 19:38 - 19:51 or maybe he's just a simp. But, of course, you don't have to start off with items like this. You can go for more reasonably priced ones and work your way up. That's what Ben did. You also don't have to pay for marketing as as you can leverage social media platforms to grow your customer base completely free. I mean, Ben struck gold on TikTok when he started posting fashion content and has now amassed over 1,600,000 Time: 19:51 - 20:15 followers. Thirdly, how easy is it to make a thousand dollars per month? I'd give this a one out of five, as when you're dealing with luxury goods, the profit margins are usually very nice. Combine this with the average sale, and you can make this kind of money with just one item. The tricky Time: 20:15 - 20:33 thing for this side hustle is getting that initial money to start, which is something you don't have to worry about with Time: 20:34 - 20:39 online Time: 20:40 - 20:40 writing. This is Adam, and he earns over $10,000 Time: 20:41 - 20:45 a month through online writing. Before you get carried away, he's not writing the next Harry Potter or Game of Thrones. Time: 20:45 - 20:51 That kind of writing doesn't earn you a good income until you get published and hit it big, which is a one in a million chance for most writers. Adam instead writes what's actually in demand and publishes where the readers are, online. He started off writing blog posts about his travels to earn passive income and live anywhere in the world. This later led him to working as a copywriter for large influencers. Time: 20:51 - 21:14 He got one client, which led to another, and so on. He told me when he offers a service, he always tries to be exclusive Time: 21:14 - 21:22 and do it in a way that no one else could. There's always gonna be someone cheaper than you, but not always someone more expensive. Time: 21:22 - 21:30 Find a client who can afford to pay the premium, Time: 21:31 - 21:33 then offer a world class service. Words can make you sound smart, or they can do the opposite depending on how they're deployed. Time: 21:33 - 21:42 That's why businesses hire copywriters. Time: 21:42 - 21:44 Basically, Time: 21:45 - 21:46 salesman, but in print. And it's not just websites either. People need quality writers for all sorts of things. Everything from TikTok scripts to threads on Twitter, Time: 21:46 - 21:56 content is king. And the magician behind all of this is often the writer. Firstly, how much time does writing take to learn? I'd give this a five Time: 21:57 - 22:06 out of five as writing is one of the hardest things to do, not physically, Time: 22:07 - 22:12 but mentally, Time: 22:12 - 22:13 especially in this day and age where it's so easy to get distracted by notifications. Time: 22:14 - 22:17 In order to be a good writer, you need to achieve a state of flow, and that only comes when you're able to focus for long periods of time. This is a dying skill. The declining quality of our films and TV shows can be partially attributed to the inability of many new writers to focus. So if you can master it, then you could be making some serious bag. Secondly, Time: 22:18 - 22:41 how much money do you need? I'd give this a one out of five as you honestly only need the bare minimum. Time: 22:42 - 22:49 Even a cheap phone will do. This is an ideal side hustle for people that want to make some instant cash and not have to worry about ever really upgrading their equipment. Thirdly, Time: 22:50 - 23:00 how easy is it to make a thousand dollars per month? I'd give this a one Time: 23:00 - 23:05 out of five, as once you've mastered the art of selling through your writing, you can make insane amounts of money. I'm talking over $500 Time: 23:06 - 23:14 an hour in many cases. It all depends on how good you are at making connections, Time: 23:14 - 23:18 your skill with words, and how fast you can write. Some charge as much as $50,000 Time: 23:19 - 23:25 for just one webpage. Time: 23:25 - 23:26 You may be thinking, why so much? Well, it's all about value. If you charge $50,000 Time: 23:27 - 23:33 for a web page and it results in a business monthly sales profit going from $200,000 Time: 23:33 - 23:39 to $400,000 Time: 23:39 - 23:41 wouldn't you say it's worth it? It's all about leverage, Time: 23:41 - 23:44 making rich clients even richer Time: 23:44 - 23:47 than asking for your slice of the pie.

      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:05 you need to focus on one thing, Time: 00:06 - 00:08 making your first Time: 00:08 - 00:09 ten thousand dollars. When I was 18, I had no money and no qualifications, Time: 00:10 - 00:14 but I did have big ambitions. Time: 00:15 - 00:17 Instead of worrying about making millions, Time: 00:17 - 00:19 I set myself the smaller, more achievable goal of making 10 k. Now as a self made millionaire, I can tell you that first ten thousand dollars was the hardest to make. But once I hit it, everything changed. It wasn't just about the money. It was about proving to myself that making money is a skill and not luck. Once I figured out how to make 10 k once, I knew I could do it again and again and eventually Time: 00:20 - 00:46 scale it into real wealth. So if I had to start from zero and make that first ten thousand dollars all over again, this is exactly how I do it in three steps. Time: 00:46 - 00:55 Most people make this way harder than it needs to be. They jump into crypto because their friend made money from it, or they try day trading because some guru promised it would make them rich. The problem is both these methods need huge upfront cash reserves and crazy luck. These aren't side hustles, and they should never be seen as your main source of income. Instead, Time: 00:59 - 01:20 think of them as tools to multiply your money. When you're just starting out, you need something that requires a small amount of money to begin with and constantly puts cash in your pocket every day. When you strip away all the noise, there are only really four options. I've tried all of these, and take it from me, this choice is crucial because some options offer higher scalability, Time: 01:20 - 01:41 while others are more limited. Time: 01:41 - 01:43 In the same way, some generate quick cash, while others take more time to make money. Option one is selling in person services. Look. You've probably heard of these before, but I'm talking personal training, Time: 01:43 - 01:55 delivery driving, dog walking, nail designing, Time: 01:55 - 01:58 barbering, Time: 01:59 - 01:59 videography, Time: 02:00 - 02:00 and so many more. Although these services sound so common and basic, they're actually one of the fastest ways to make money. So don't overlook them as they give you a way to get paid immediately. Time: 02:01 - 02:12 It's also pretty cheap to get started. All you need is some skills and maybe a few tools, which means you can get up and running very quickly. If you choose to do this, then please don't mess around trying to build a website, run ads, or make a logo. Just get out there. Find some customers in your local area, deliver the service, and get paid. Time: 02:12 - 02:33 I even did this when I was in my teens. I used to walk around rich neighborhoods and offer to wash people's cars. I'd look out for tidy gardens but dirty vehicles. Now this might sound strange. However, I was betting if they were obsessed over keeping their garden tidy, they'd also want a nice shiny car on their driveway to impress their neighbors. Because these kinds of services are limited by your local area, it meant my demand was pretty up and down. Some months were busy, and others, I struggled to make anything. Time: 02:33 - 03:03 When I was busy, I was only able to work with one person at a time, which kept how much I could make in a day. So in person services are great to get started with, but you can quickly feel like they're limiting your potential. Time: 03:03 - 03:16 That brings me on to option two, which is local products. This is selling things like home baked goods, Time: 03:17 - 03:24 handmade items, artwork, Time: 03:24 - 03:26 fresh produce, and much more. This can be a great way to make money, but it's not something that happens overnight. Time: 03:26 - 03:32 Unlike services where you get paid as soon as the job's done, selling local products takes time. I gave this a go using some of the profits from my car washing business. Time: 03:33 - 03:42 I bought some cheap model plane parts, then spent some time building each one up, and then sold them to people at the RC flying club, which I went to on the weekends. However, Time: 03:42 - 03:51 I quickly realized I was putting a lot of work in for very little money. This was hard for me to come to terms with because I really enjoyed building them. Most of my earnings were being eaten up by the cost of materials. Time: 03:52 - 04:04 And on top of that, my customer base was very limited as there weren't enough people willing to pay what I needed to make it worth my time. So selling local products can be fun, and it's definitely worth it if you wanna make some money from something you love. Option three is global products. This includes starting a clothing brand, drop shipping, Time: 04:04 - 04:24 sneaker reselling, print on demand, and so much more. Unlike in person services or local products, going global means you have access to a much larger customer base, which gives you more opportunities to make money. You're not limited to just the people in your town or city. Time: 04:24 - 04:40 Anyone, anywhere can buy from you. I was so excited about launching my own global products. Time: 04:41 - 04:46 I even flew all the way to China to partner with a manufacturer to produce my model airplane designs and sell them worldwide. Of course, you don't have to do this if you choose to go down the drop shipping or print on demand routes. However, this wasn't really an option when I started. If I'm honest, things started off pretty slowly for me because I had to keep reinvesting my profits back into new products to sell. Every sale required more investment. Time: 04:47 - 05:12 Once I sold 10 items, I then needed to buy 20 more to keep up. Instead of pocketing the profits, my money kept getting trapped in this endless cycle of restocking. Ultimately, Time: 05:12 - 05:22 was it worth it? 100%. Time: 05:22 - 05:25 However, you should only do this if you have the patience to wait one to three months for everything to start kicking off. So when this is up and running, it is probably the most passive, Time: 05:25 - 05:35 laziest way to make money that actually works. So that brings us on to option four, Time: 05:35 - 05:41 selling online services. This option wasn't actually possible for me when I was younger, but this is such an advantage nowadays. There are so many different online services you can offer. These include copywriting, Time: 05:42 - 05:53 video editing, thumbnail design, running ads, social media management. The list goes on. Selling online services actually combines the two biggest benefits from the in person services Time: 05:54 - 06:05 and global products. This is because you get the global reach, but the profit margins of a service. With products, you might make 20 to 30% margin that needs to be reinvested. Time: 06:06 - 06:16 With services, Time: 06:17 - 06:18 you're looking at 70 to 80% margins that go straight into your pocket. Plus, you can start making money from day one. Look. All of these are fantastic ways to make $10,000 Time: 06:18 - 06:29 as a student, especially Time: 06:29 - 06:30 these last two options. Time: 06:31 - 06:32 However, if I wanted to start making money as fast as possible, then I'd go with option four, Time: 06:32 - 06:38 selling Time: 06:39 - 06:39 online Time: 06:40 - 06:40 services. So now we need to figure out exactly what online service to offer. Time: 06:40 - 06:45 So start by asking yourself three questions. Time: 06:46 - 06:49 What are you really good at? What do you enjoy learning about? And what problems do businesses consistently struggle with? The sweet spot is where your answers overlap. Most people get stuck at this stage as they spend months or even years trying to perfect their skill before offering it to anyone. That is totally backwards. Time: 06:49 - 07:08 You need to start getting real world experience as quickly as possible. Time: 07:08 - 07:11 So start by setting your prices under the normal market rate. Your main aim here is to earn and learn at the same time. Now let's take this one step further. Time: 07:12 - 07:21 This Time: 07:24 - 07:24 is the skill pyramid, Time: 07:25 - 07:26 made up of four elements that when mastered together transform a high income skill into a $10,000 Time: 07:26 - 07:33 income. Time: 07:33 - 07:34 Mistress one, and you'll stay stuck at the bottom, working hard but never breaking through. Element one Time: 07:34 - 07:41 is positioning. You see, not all online services are equal. The real money is in offering to help businesses make more money. That's because businesses think about money differently to individuals. Time: 07:41 - 07:53 When a business is making $50,000 Time: 07:53 - 07:55 a month, spending 2,000 to solve a problem isn't a big deal as long as it helps them make more money. And take it from me, they have a lot of these problems. Time: 07:55 - 08:05 They need more customers. They need better systems. They need to stand out from their competition, and they need to convert more leads into sales. Time: 08:05 - 08:13 These problems never go away, and businesses Time: 08:13 - 08:16 are always willing to pay to solve them. On top of this, some industries simply have more money to spend than others. And if you think about how you can reposition yourself, you'll start making real money faster. Time: 08:17 - 08:28 Here are some ideas to get you thinking. Instead of being a video editor for small YouTubers, Time: 08:28 - 08:33 you could edit videos for an entrepreneur who sells a product. If you make random thumbnails for clients, you could instead aim to become the main designer for an established creator. And if you're a copywriter, Time: 08:34 - 08:45 don't write cheap articles. Instead, focus on optimizing landing pages. This isn't about learning more skills. It's about putting yourself where the money's being made. Element two is leverage. Time: 08:46 - 08:57 You'll never make 10,000 Time: 08:58 - 08:59 without leveraging value over time. Time: 08:59 - 09:02 Businesses don't pay for effort. They pay for results. If you stop charging for the hours you work and instead for the return on investment you provide, you'll instantly make more money. Let's say you choose to run Facebook ads. If you charge per hour, you're stuck with a fixed rate, and the client will always wanna keep your hours low. But if you charge based on the money you bring in for the business, suddenly, they're not thinking about cost. They're thinking about profit. Time: 09:02 - 09:29 And when they see that your work is directly making them money, they'll happily pay you more for it. The same goes for if you decide to offer social media management. If you just schedule posts and reply to comments, you're replaceable. Time: 09:30 - 09:41 But if you can prove that your strategy is bringing in more engagement, Time: 09:42 - 09:46 more leads, and more sales, Time: 09:46 - 09:48 you become a valuable asset, not just an expense. Trust me. The moment you shift your pitch from what you do to what they gain, you'll find a lot of people are suddenly willing to pay a lot more. Element three is reach. One of the biggest mistakes people make when starting out is thinking they always have to chase clients, but that's not how the game should be played. Time: 09:48 - 10:08 Right from the start, you need to be thinking about how to make clients come to you. Recently, Time: 10:09 - 10:14 I was looking for a graphic designer for a specific task, making movie style posters. So the first thing I did was look on TikTok for people who made these kinds of designs, Time: 10:14 - 10:24 and one person Time: 10:24 - 10:25 dominated the search results. So I reached out to him and asked him for his prices. He told me he was just posting some of his designs for fun on TikTok. He wasn't even doing it as a side hustle so politely declined. However, his videos kept growing in popularity, and his inbox was flooded with DMs asking to work with him. A few weeks later, he reached back out to me asking how to start getting paid. I helped him set up a proper business, and now he works for me and many other clients. Time: 10:26 - 10:53 This just goes to show that you should always be putting your work out there online even if you're just starting out or just doing something because you enjoy it. You never know what opportunities might come from it. So if you edit videos, show before and after clips to highlight how much better your edits make the content. If you design thumbnails, Time: 10:53 - 11:12 explain why your design got more clicks. And if you're learning social media, document how you're growing an account from scratch. Element four Time: 11:13 - 11:21 is automation. Time: 11:21 - 11:22 Ninety five percent of people that try to start a side hustle or business fail before they even really get going. Here's why. After working with countless copywriters, Time: 11:23 - 11:32 thumbnail designers, Time: 11:32 - 11:33 web developers, and video editors, I can tell you that 95% Time: 11:34 - 11:37 of them promise to deliver on time, then completely miss their deadlines. The thing that will make you stand out the most isn't talent or charisma, It's reliability. Time: 11:37 - 11:46 And overlooking this is the biggest mistake young people make when starting out. The people I've ended up paying thousands to aren't always the best at what they do, but they're the most organized. Time: 11:47 - 11:57 They never miss deadlines. They always communicate clearly, and they make working with them effortless. Time: 11:57 - 12:03 So take it from me. Being good at what you do is one thing, but being reliable is what gets you paid again and again. So how do you do this? Well, the most successful people I know don't rely on memory or messy notes. They use automation. And if you're thinking about making money online, you need something to help you keep track of everything. That's why I recommend using a CRM system. Time: 12:03 - 12:25 Odoo CRM is great. It helps you remember who you talked to, what they wanted, and what you need to do next. Instead of scrolling through emails or DMs trying to find what the client said, everything is in one place. I mean, you can visualize all your opportunities with this call board, which helps you see the expected revenue at each stage so you know where to focus your efforts. Time: 12:25 - 12:47 You can also use it to schedule calls and meetings effortlessly. Time: 12:48 - 12:51 Plus, with your emails, notes, and files all in one place, Time: 12:52 - 12:55 staying organized is very easy. You can use it to easily track your clients and projects so you never miss a deadline. You can set reminders to follow-up with people so you always look professional. At the end of the day, clients don't just want someone skilled. They want someone they can count on. As I was planning on talking about them anyway, I reached out to Odoo to see if they wanted to sponsor this portion of the video, and they agreed. They also offer your first application Time: 12:56 - 13:20 completely free with unlimited support and hosting. So if that interests you, I'll drop a link in the description. Time: 13:21 - 13:27 I don't care how much money you make. Until you see at least $1,000,000 Time: 13:29 - 13:33 in your bank, you shouldn't be wasting it. The supercars, the designer clothes, the nights out, none of it matters unless you can turn your income into long term wealth. The rich see their income as something to spend, whereas the wealthy use it to make more money. So how do you do this? Well, you need to start investing. In front of me, I've got a risk scale, and I'm gonna walk you through the four key areas where I put my money starting from the safest investments all the way up to the highest risk plays. Remember, I'm not a financial adviser. I'm just sharing what's worked for me over the years. Let's kick this off with my high interest savings account. They call it a high interest savings account, but, honestly, at 3%, I have no idea how to get away with that name. Now, sure, you can find better rates if you're willing to lock your money away for a set period or agree to strict deposit limits each month, But I don't want my savings held hostage. Time: 13:33 - 14:27 I want access to my money when I need it, not stuck behind some rule that says I can only withdraw on the first Tuesday of every leap year. And I know what some of you are thinking. Mark, this isn't really investing. This is just holding cash. And, yeah, you've got a point. But having some cash on the sidelines means you're not forced to sell investments at the wrong time. Imagine the market crashes and you suddenly need money for an emergency. Time: 14:27 - 14:51 If you don't have cash saved up, you'll have no choice but to sell stocks at a loss, and that's the fastest way to lock in a bad decision. A high interest savings account is like your financial safety net. It's not about making big returns. It's about having a buffer so that when life throws unexpected Time: 14:51 - 15:09 expenses at you, you're covered without wrecking your long term investments. Investment two Time: 15:09 - 15:14 is index funds. Have you ever heard the saying, it only takes the price of a coffee a day to become a millionaire? Time: 15:15 - 15:21 Well, that's down to index funds and ETFs. I've made a lot of money from simple long term index fund investing, and as an added benefit, it's extremely low maintenance. There are tons of different index funds and ETFs, but the most popular buzzword, of course, is the S and P five hundred, which is 503 Time: 15:21 - 15:39 of the top publicly traded companies in America, Time: 15:39 - 15:42 all packed into one easy investment. Even though this is the biggest index fund in my portfolio by percentage, Time: 15:43 - 15:49 I do also invest into a total stock market fund. The best I found for US Investors is VTSAX, Time: 15:49 - 15:55 and for The UK people, is the VWRL Time: 15:56 - 15:58 ETF. Additionally, Time: 15:59 - 16:00 I think it's important to have some money invested in an emerging market index fund. The best I found in The USA is the VWO, Time: 16:01 - 16:08 and in The UK is the VFEM Time: 16:09 - 16:11 ETF. But there are lots of other emerging market funds available, so it's worth having a bit of a look around. If all those index fund names made you glaze over, then here's an awesome fact to wake you up. The average return of the s and p five hundred over the last ten years has been over 10%, which means if you invest just $5, instead of buying a coffee every single day from the age of 18 to 67 Time: 16:12 - 16:36 and achieve the same return, then you'd retire with over $1,000,000. Time: 16:36 - 16:41 And if you don't wanna wait until you're 67, Time: 16:41 - 16:43 just invest more money. That's what I've done for many years, and it's worked really well for me. Investment three is Time: 16:43 - 16:50 individual stocks. Time: 16:50 - 16:51 Now this is where things get exciting. Time: 16:52 - 16:54 Individual stocks can be a great way to start investing, Time: 16:54 - 16:57 especially with smaller amounts of money. They allow you to get hands on experience with the market in a way that index funds don't. When I first started, I really enjoyed picking stocks and learning how to read companies' financial statements. Honestly, Time: 16:58 - 17:11 if I hadn't actually invested my own money, I doubt I'd ever been motivated to understand how it all worked. That's why when you're starting out, individual stocks can feel more engaging. Of course, they also come with higher risk. But if you're only investing a small amount, it can be a useful way to learn how the market moves without putting too much at stake. Another big advantage is that you get direct exposure to specific companies. With index funds, Time: 17:11 - 17:38 even if a company's performing incredibly well, it may only make up a small part of your portfolio. With individual stocks, you get to experience those gains more directly. But, of course, this means more ups and downs, which is something to keep in mind. By the way, trading two one two are currently giving away a free fractional share worth up to £200 Time: 17:38 - 17:57 when you use the code tilbury and fund your account. So if you wanna pick that up, I'll leave the link in the description below. Investment four is cryptocurrency. Time: 17:58 - 18:06 When Bitcoin first came out in 02/2009, Time: 18:07 - 18:10 I, Time: 18:10 - 18:10 like a lot of people, just assumed it was a scam. I was used to investing in real tangible assets like property and stocks, Time: 18:11 - 18:18 things backed by actual companies. The idea of some digital currency with no one in charge seemed way too risky. But as time went on, I started paying more attention. Time: 18:19 - 18:29 By early two thousand and nineteen, I decided to dip my toes in. And over the last few years, I've been steadily buying more Bitcoin and Ethereum. Time: 18:29 - 18:38 Looking back, it's been a solid move, and it's made me a decent amount of money. Now I won't deny that altcoins and meme coins can make people crazy returns, Time: 18:38 - 18:48 but they're also way riskier. For every person who makes a fortune, there's plenty who lose it just as fast. These days, I'd say I'm a lot more bullish on crypto, but I'm still playing it smart, building my position slowly, dollar cost averaging, and making sure I'm not just jumping in at bad prices. Of course, crypto is super volatile, and like any investment, it carries risks. That's why it's important to do your own research and only invest what you can afford to lose. If you're ready to learn how to invest in everything I just talked about, then I'll leave that video right up there. But don't click on it just yet. Make sure to subscribe if you wanna grow your wealth. Okay? I'll see you over there. Time: 18:48 - 19:28Remember guys 10k can be 20k if you put it on red",

      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:05 10 thousand, or even a hundred thousand dollars? Well, sadly, this isn't something they teach in school. Come to think of it, it'd have been pretty awesome if they had. Because of this lack of knowledge, it seems pretty scary for most beginners to get started in investing. But in today's video, I'm gonna simplify the whole process. Investing my money, allowing me to become a multimillionaire. Time: 00:05 - 00:25 And guess what I started with? That's right. A hundred dollars. Well, probably less than that, to be honest. I'm not saying becoming rich is easy, but by taking calculated risks, you'll be able to grow your wealth over time. I understand everyone has a different risk tolerance. So today, I'm gonna be revealing how to invest for beginners with a hundred dollars. And as we go through the video, the risk is gonna increase. But remember, as the risk goes up, so does the potential reward. I'll also be putting my money where my mouth is and investing a hundred dollars into each one of these options so you can see exactly how to do it. I'm just about to invest in something I never thought I'd actually do. Time: 00:25 - 01:03 Here it goes. When someone asks me how they should invest a hundred dollars, I usually say invest in yourself. You can do this by buying books and improving your skills, but assuming you've already done this, now we're gonna be talking about the specific places you can actually put Time: 01:04 - 01:19 your money. Now I'm a businessman. I'm not a financial advisor. These are just some of the ways I've invested my money over the years, and they've worked for me. You can also sit back and relax because I'm not gonna try and sell you anything at the end. Just remember, if you enjoy the video, then smash that like button because it really helps push this video out to more people. And also consider subscribing if you wanna grow your wealth. The first investment is a high interest savings account. This is a one out of 10 on the risk scale, so the lowest possible risk that you can have. Nowadays, it's extremely hard to find any savings account that'll will pay a substantial amount of interest, but that's not the main reason it's on the list. By putting your money into a savings account, you're actually starting to create what I like to call an emergency fund, which I believe everyone should have. This is money that you can access if something unexpected comes up and it's extremely low risk. And by having money on hand, you can avoid getting into debt and having to pay crazy fees back. I remember when I bought my first apartment, I had a minor crisis after about two months as a hot water system went wrong and it needed replacing. Because of my emergency fund, it saved me over $200 Time: 01:20 - 02:27 as I didn't have to take out a payday loan. When you leave your money in the bank, it slowly loses its value. So when I am looking for the best savings account to combat this, I look for two things. The first, of course, is a good interest rate, which depends on the economy mostly. The second thing is having the ability to access my money instantly. Some banks that are really worth looking at and consistently have a good rate of interest Time: 02:27 - 02:48 are Ally Bank, Marcus by Goldman Sachs, and Citibank. I currently have an account with Marcus by Goldman Sachs, and their interest rate is naught point 7%, Time: 02:49 - 02:58 which isn't very high, but is currently one of the best available. So there we go. Nice and easy. A hundred dollars deposited into my savings account. Now for gold, often referred to as a safe haven. I'll give this also a two out of 10 on the risk scale. Did you know that since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, Time: 02:58 - 03:16 the US dollar has lost 95% Time: 03:16 - 03:19 of its value. So you are actually only left with 5% of its original purchasing power. So if you wanna stop your money losing value, then maybe gold is for you. If you had a hundred dollar nugget of gold in the year February, Time: 03:19 - 03:31 it would now be worth approximately Time: 03:31 - 03:33 $580 Time: 03:33 - 03:35 The piece of gold hasn't actually changed in size. It's still the same piece of metal, but what has actually changed is the value of your dollar and how much gold you can buy with it. Gold was actually our original currency used by our forefathers. Time: 03:35 - 03:47 I remember those days well. It's perfect as it can't be manufactured and it lasts for thousands and thousands of years. So if you've ever watched Gold Rush on TV, you'll know how hard it is to actually mine this stuff out of the ground. Now you may be wondering, if it's so safe, why have I given it a two out of 10 on the risk scale? It all comes down to opportunity cost. You have to ask yourself if you really want to just protect your hundred dollars against inflation or if you wanna invest it in other opportunities, Time: 03:48 - 04:14 which could make it grow a lot quicker. If you invest in gold, then you would be missing out on these potential profits, making it a little bit risky. I would say that this is the perfect investment if you have a lot of money already and all you want to do is just protect it. There are two different ways that you can invest in gold. The first way would be to actually buy physical gold. But if I bought jewelry, I know gold bars, coins, and that sort of thing, I'd probably be paying too much because the person selling it would wanna make a profit, which means I would be paying more than the true value of the gold itself. The alternative is to invest in gold within a broker app like Robinhood in The USA or Trading two twelve in The UK. Then you're able to buy gold at its true value and have the option to sell much quicker. In The USA, I would look for the GLD Time: 04:14 - 05:00 ETF on Robinhood, which is one of the largest gold ETFs in the world. As of June 2020, they hold over 36,490,000 Time: 05:01 - 05:10 ounces of gold in vaults all around the world. As I'm currently in The UK, I'm gonna invest using trading two one two in a similar share. And with just a click of a button, there you go. I'm now mister gold man. If that doesn't sound exciting enough for you, then why don't you try a simple low cost index fund? I'll give this a three out of 10 on the risk scale. If you invested just a hundred dollars per month into an index fund with a 7% Time: 05:10 - 05:34 annual return, then after thirty years, you'd have $123,000 Time: 05:34 - 05:40 That's the power of compound interest. You can do all of this without having any knowledge of the stock market. I remember when Warren Buffett, one of the richest men in the world, placed a million dollar bet that a simple S and P 500 index fund would outperform Time: 05:40 - 05:55 a professionally picked portfolio of hedge funds over a ten year period. Time: 05:55 - 06:00 Now this contest wrapped up in 02/2017, Time: 06:00 - 06:03 and the results were made public. Warren Buffett had actually won a million dollar bet, which really shows the power of index funds and that the everyday person can take on the pros with little to no knowledge. Imagine an index fund is like a bag of Haribo gummies. The machine in the factory puts a range of the most popular candy into one bag so you can enjoy the best of the best without having to pick and buy each and every one individually. Now just replace the candy with companies. That's what an index fund is. You can buy your own selection bag of the most popular companies in the world, such as Apple, Microsoft, Time: 06:03 - 06:39 Amazon, and Facebook, and your money is split between all of them. Now let's go back to the haribos. Imagine you left these on the sides and they're open for a few days or so. They'd go hard and they certainly wouldn't taste as good, would they? But by putting them in a container, you can stop that from happening. Time: 06:39 - 06:55 This is very much like index funds, is if you leave them unprotected, the government will start taxing you on the profits you make. But you can protect them with a sort of container like this, which is known as different things in different countries. Time: 06:57 - 07:08 In America, Time: 07:09 - 07:09 it's called a Roth IRA, and in The UK, it's an ISA. These containers allow you to protect your money after tax, and then any profits you make are yours to keep. But because they're so good and they're so powerful, there's a cap on how much you're allowed to invest each year. So if I was you, I would take full advantage as soon as possible and max out your allowance. There are more in-depth strategies you can use, but for the purpose of this video, I'm gonna be investing a hundred dollars into an S and P five hundred index fund, which over the last twenty years has an average yearly return of 7%. Time: 07:10 - 07:45 Drop a like if you'd like a full video covering this topic because there's so much on this we could talk about. But Mark, a hundred dollars isn't enough as the S and P five hundred is over $3,000 Time: 07:46 - 07:57 a share. Well, you don't actually have to buy a full share to invest. My favorite brokers are Fidelity, Time: 07:57 - 08:02 Charles Schwab, and Vanguard. So if we head over to Vanguard's website now and we find the S and P 500, here you can see what companies are in the index fund so you can buy the right one. So all you have to do is create an account. I already have one and deposit some money and then click. Time: 08:02 - 08:18 There you go. Job done. The fourth way to invest is in a real estate investment trust, otherwise known as a REIT. I'll also give this a three out of 10 on the risk scale. Now imagine your friend collected $100 Time: 08:18 - 08:30 from 3,000 people. He will have $300,000 Time: 08:30 - 08:34 Then he takes this money and he buys a property. He rents it out and splits it with all 3,000 people that helped him buy the property, which helps them start generating some of that sweet Time: 08:34 - 08:44 passive income. That's the basic way of explaining a REIT. It lets everyone benefit from investing in income producing properties without actually buying one. Think of it like buying a small share in a property. Time: 08:44 - 08:55 Let's say you own the front door, someone else owns the windows, and and a few other people own all the bricks, but altogether, Time: 08:56 - 09:02 you own the property. Equity REITs own things like offices, Time: 09:03 - 09:06 shopping centers, apartments, Time: 09:07 - 09:08 hotels, and much more, and they get their income through the rent. By law, they have to pass on 90% of all profits to the investor. Like a dividend, however, they're taxed a little differently. The cool thing is that at the start of 2,019, Time: 09:09 - 09:22 the ten year average return for REIT ETFs did better than the S and P five hundred with an average return of 10%. Time: 09:22 - 09:29 If you're in The USA by investing in the VGSLX Time: 09:30 - 09:32 by Vanguard, you can average a 12% Time: 09:33 - 09:36 return, which beats the average real estate investor. How awesome is that? As I'm in The UK, I'm gonna use the trading two one two website to put a hundred dollars into a similar REIT. It has high global diversification, Time: 09:36 - 09:48 meaning I can invest in all the up and coming property markets around the world. The next option is buying and selling items. The risk on this really depends on how good you are at finding great deals, but I'll give this a, I don't know, four out of 10 on the risk scale. The good thing about doing this is that you can buy and sell something that you're interested in and have knowledge about, which can lead to bigger possible returns. Now I'm going to invest my hundred dollars in either pre owned radio control model gear or golf equipment. Both of these I've got an interest in, so I should have a reasonable idea of what each item is worth. Pokemon cards would be a great area to have some expertise in as their value at the moment is skyrocketing. Time: 09:49 - 10:26 Logan Paul just bought a Charizard card for over a hundred and $50,000. Time: 10:27 - 10:32 How mad is that? So I've been on Facebook Marketplace as most people don't have access to that platform, and I found myself a model engine that I'm gonna go and try and buy. It's up for 75 pound, which is approximately a hundred US dollars. We sent a few messages back and forth, and I'm gonna go and have a look at the item now. Time: 10:32 - 10:48 Hello there. How come about the engine? Oh, yeah. Here you go. Oh, in the box as well. Cool. That's good. That is all all boxed. Cool. That looks alright. So would you take 70 for it? No. I've got 75 Time: 10:57 - 11:08 in this box in good condition. Time: 11:08 - 11:09 Can you do a bit better? I'll tell you what I can do. Time: 11:10 - 11:12 There you go. I'll throw that in. That's that's where it came out of £75. That'd be that's that's a deal. Okay. But Here you go. I'll give you £75. Time: 11:15 - 11:23 Lovely. Thank you very much. We're videoing this for our YouTube channel. Do you mind? No. That's fine. Alright then. Okay. See you again. Thanks a lot. Thanks Time: 11:23 - 11:29 for that. Time: 11:29 - 11:30 So I've done a listing on eBay for the model engine. And the model plane, I'm gonna actually advertise on a specialized website for model flying as I'm sure I'll be then selling to the right people and hoping for big profits. Now we're starting to get serious. It's time for individual stocks. This gets a 6.5 Time: 11:32 - 11:49 out of 10 on the risk scale. There's a certain amount of risk that comes with investing in individual stocks, but if you pick your companies well, then it can be really exciting as there's the potential to make a lot of money. During the .com boom back in 1995, Time: 11:49 - 12:03 I was really lucky to pick a few great stocks, which I cashed in, and I made a lot of money in a very short period of time. When the bubble burst, some of the companies I'd held onto, which had cost me very little, went completely out of business. Luck and timing can be a very crucial part of stock investing. I picked these stocks using what's called fundamental analysis, which means I looked at the business financial statements, Time: 12:03 - 12:25 their market, and also the leadership of their companies. Back then, this was a lot of work, but now it's easily found out on Yahoo Finance. A while ago, I read an article about an experiment where they simulated 100 monkeys throwing darts Time: 12:26 - 12:40 like this at the financial pages of a newspaper. The stocks the monkeys picked on average outperformed the so called smartest hedge fund managers on Wall Street. So for this video, I thought it'd be fun to put this theory to the test. I don't have a monkey, so I thought I'd have to do. So I'm gonna throw a dart at the board, and as you can see, I randomly selected Time: 12:40 - 13:00 20 different stocks. And wherever the dart lands, that's what I'm gonna invest in. Now I've just gotta put on a blindfold. Time: 13:00 - 13:06 Okay. Here we go. Time: 13:06 - 13:08 Oh, Oh, you hit it. Right. Let's see what we got. Time: 13:08 - 13:11 And we've gone into Samsung. Time: 13:12 - 13:14 Right. So I'm gonna jump straight onto my brokerage account and set an order for Samsung. Time: 13:15 - 13:19 If you wanna invest your hundred dollars in individual stock, then Webull are currently giving away three free stocks for a limited time when you deposit a hundred dollars into your account. I'll just leave the link in the description if you wanna pick up those free stocks. So now we're gonna be moving into the realm of gambling and speculation Time: 13:21 - 13:37 rather than investing. Number seven is cryptocurrency. Time: 13:37 - 13:40 This is a nine out of 10 on the risk scale. So you've probably heard of Bitcoin. This is currently the most popular type of crypto. If you'd have bought a hundred dollars worth of Bitcoin in 02/2015, Time: 13:40 - 13:52 today, it would have been worth around about $5,000 Time: 13:52 - 13:56 That's a 5000% Time: 13:56 - 13:57 return on your investment, and that's pretty unheard of. Therefore, many people that invested in Bitcoin in the early days became millionaires overnight, but a lot of people also lost money. Time: 13:57 - 14:02 If Time: 14:03 - 14:03 also lost money. If you'd invested around a hundred dollars in December Time: 14:06 - 14:10 2017 Time: 14:10 - 14:11 when Bitcoin was at an all time high, by December Time: 14:11 - 14:15 2018, Time: 14:15 - 14:16 you'd have had less than $17 Time: 14:16 - 14:17 left. So, really, no one really knows what it's gonna do next. It's extremely risky, but still very attractive because it has the potential Time: 14:17 - 14:26 to make you millions. There are three main types of cryptos. These are Ethereum, Ripple, and obviously the big one, Bitcoin. But let's just focus on Bitcoin today. If you wanna learn more about other types of coins, you can read something called a white paper, and it will give you all the details. The cool thing about Bitcoin is that it uses something called blockchain and it isn't regulated by the government. You also can't create any more Bitcoins, which makes inflation absolutely impossible. In my opinion, this investment will probably only make sense if you are investing an extra hundred dollars that you don't really need. So I'm gonna jump onto the most popular Bitcoin app, which is called Coinbase, Time: 14:26 - 15:02 and invest my hundred dollars in Bitcoin and forget about Time: 15:02 - 15:05 it. By the way, if you wanted to give this a try, I'll put a link to Coinbase in the description down below, and you can pick up $10 of free Bitcoin. At least that gives you a bit of a head start. The last is definitely a full on gamble. You may have guessed it already. It's the lotto. This is definitely a 10 out of 10 on the risk scale and isn't something I would recommend doing. However, I thought I'd include it in this investing video as so many people choose to do it. In fact, 57% Time: 15:07 - 15:33 of all Americans buy at least one lotto ticket per year. The chance of actually winning is one in fourteen million, which might sound quite possible. So but let me just try and put that into a bit of perspective. You're 4,000 Time: 15:33 - 15:46 times more likely to win an Oscar than win the lotto. Millions of people lose their money every year, but they keep playing as the rewards are sky high if you win. I'm just about to invest in something I never thought I'd actually do. Here it goes. Can I have a hundred scratch cards, please? Time: 15:46 - 16:03 Lovely. Thank you very much. Thanks for your help. Cheers, and thanks. Bye. Time: 16:07 - 16:10 As you can see, this is gonna take me quite a while. I'm gonna leave a counter on the screen so you can see how much I've spent versus how much I've earned back from my investment. Time: 16:10 - 16:20 Let's do this. Time: 16:20 - 16:21 I hope there's a bit more in this lot. There's gotta be, hasn't there? Time: 16:27 - 16:31 So we're halfway through. The most we've earned so far is $3 on one ticket. I'm gonna need some help. I've got 50 more to go. Come on, Curtis. I know you've been itching to have a go at this. Have you got your coin ready? I do. Ready. Let's race to see, wait for it, who can find the most money in the remaining 50 cards. Ready? Okay. On your marks, get set, Time: 16:41 - 17:02 go. Time: 17:03 - 17:04 Y'all ready to go? Time: 17:07 - 17:09 Come on. Time: 17:10 - 17:11 Let's do it. Time: 17:12 - 17:13 $15. Time: 17:15 - 17:16 Really? Yeah. No. Yeah. Time: 17:17 - 17:19 Oh, wow. $15. Time: 17:20 - 17:21 15 dollars. He's only just started doing this. He's got more than me. I've beaten you already. Time: 17:21 - 17:26 Wow. Find a two x to win two times. That must be $10, we think. Is that $10? 10 dollars. 10 dollars. 10 dollars. Time: 17:30 - 17:38 What do you get? You say you're smashing me, but I'll tell you what. How about this? How about this? Another Time: 17:39 - 17:45 dollar. I'll I'll tell you what. This has gotta be an astonishing last four cards if we're gonna get any money back from this. So we just came back and we double checked it. We made back $50 from our hundred dollar investment. Time: 17:56 - 18:07 Now you may think that sounds pretty good, but that's actually a negative 50% return. This was meant to be a little bit of fun, but it's pretty sad to think that people play this regularly and on average are losing half their money when they could pick any one of the other investments in this video and have a much better chance of being successful. I hope this has taken some of the mystery away from the other forms of investing and made them a little bit more understandable for beginners. If you'd like me to make a part two of this video to see how these investments have done over a month, then make sure to smash that thumbs up button to let me know. I'm gonna leave the next video here, but don't click on it just yet. Remember to subscribe to the channel and ring that notification bell so you don't miss out on part two. Okay. I'll see you on the other side. Time: 18:08 - 18:49I can easily do the opposite: turning a million into a hundred.",

As a millionaire investor, this is something I get asked all the time. And because of that, four years ago, I set out to answer this question by creating a video where I invested a hundred dollars into five different things. Today, I'm gonna compare the results from those five investments that you can make from your laptop and try to finally answer the question once and for all. We're gonna be using this grid to judge each one in these categories. First up,",

      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:29 learning curve. This is how long it takes to learn the ins and outs of each method. Ideally, we want this to be as short as possible. Next is passive income potential, Time: 00:30 - 00:39 which is how much money an investment can earn for you passively while you still own it without needing to sell it. Then there's tax efficiency, Time: 00:40 - 00:47 which refers to the specific tax advantages Time: 00:48 - 00:50 or benefits available for each type of investment that can help you pay less tax. After that, we have risk level, which is about how likely you are to lose money and how much the investment's value might go up or down. And finally, we're looking at the results. Time: 00:51 - 01:06 This is where I'll reveal my percentage return over the last four years and exactly how much my hundred dollar investment is now worth. Before we jump in, please remember, I'm not a financial adviser. I'm just sharing my own results and strategies that have worked for me over the years. Please also do your own research. Time: 01:07 - 01:24 Okay. First up is individual stocks. Individual stocks give you the chance to own a piece of a company you believe in. This can be really exciting because you're directly investing in businesses that you think will grow or succeed. Time: 01:28 - 01:41 For learning curve, I'm gonna say this is high. If you want to be successful picking individual stocks, then it's not just a guessing game. You'll need to dig into the nitty gritty of a company's fundamentals. This includes looking into the financials, Time: 01:41 - 01:53 who's leading the company, and how well known the brand is. When I invest in individual stocks, I look through income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements. So when I invest in a stock, I'm in it for the long haul, which means at least two to ten years. A great way to learn how to do this is by using an investing app with a demo account, which lets you play around with fake money until you're confident with your strategies. Time: 01:54 - 02:18 For passive income potential, Time: 02:19 - 02:20 I'm gonna say this Time: 02:20 - 02:22 is good. You see, when you own a stock, there are two ways you can make money. Firstly, Time: 02:22 - 02:27 if the price of the stock goes up during the time you own it, you can sell it for more than you paid. Time: 02:27 - 02:32 Secondly, Time: 02:32 - 02:33 you can receive dividends. Dividends are regular payments to shareholders. Time: 02:33 - 02:37 Not all stocks pay dividends, but if they do, this means you can receive money without ever selling your stock. This is essentially passive income. Now for tax efficiency, Time: 02:38 - 02:47 this is great. If you use the right accounts, then you can reduce your tax burden. Time: 02:48 - 02:53 In The UK, these are called stocks and shares ISAs. Time: 02:53 - 02:56 You can set one up on most investing apps, and any profits you make are safe from taxes. In The USA, there's something similar called a Roth IRA. These accounts work like a shield, protecting your profits from the tax man. While there are different rules depending on where you live, the idea is the same. Please bear in mind that I'm not a tax advisor, and you should do your own research as everyone's circumstances Time: 02:57 - 03:18 are different. So what's the risk? This is definitely Time: 03:18 - 03:21 high. Back in 1995 Time: 03:22 - 03:24 during the .com boom, I got lucky and picked a few great stocks. I sold them at the right time and made a lot of money in a short period. But when the bubble burst, some of the other companies I'd invested in, ones that cost me very little, went out of business completely Time: 03:24 - 03:39 even though I ended up making money overall. It just shows how risky investing in individual stocks can be, especially if you put all your money into just a few companies. If they fail, you could lose everything. So let's look at how much my hundred dollar investment is now worth. Let me refresh your memory. Here's what I invested in. So I'm gonna throw a dart at the board, and as you can see, I randomly Time: 03:39 - 04:02 selected Time: 04:02 - 04:03 20 different stocks. And wherever the dart lands, that's what I'm gonna invest in. Now I've just gotta put on a blindfold. Okay. Here we go. Time: 04:03 - 04:10 Oh, you hit it. Right. Let's see what we got. Time: 04:11 - 04:14 And we've gone into Samsung. That investment is now worth Time: 04:15 - 04:19 $67.66. Time: 04:20 - 04:23 But don't forget my dividends. Time: 04:23 - 04:24 Over the four years, I made 10¢. Time: 04:25 - 04:28 So that leaves me with a total of $67.76. Time: 04:28 - 04:33 That's Time: 04:33 - 04:34 a negative Time: 04:34 - 04:35 32.34% Time: 04:35 - 04:38 return. This example perfectly shows how hit or miss individual stock investing really is. That dart could have just as easily landed on Apple, Time: 04:38 - 04:46 Microsoft, or Nvidia. So let's have a look at how much I would have made if that dart had landed a bit differently. A $100 Time: 04:46 - 04:54 investment in Apple four years ago would now be worth a hundred and $70. Time: 04:54 - 04:59 The same investment in Microsoft would be a hundred and $88, Time: 04:59 - 05:03 and drum roll, please, Nvidia would be worth Time: 05:03 - 05:07 $908. Time: 05:07 - 05:09 Those stocks have boomed in recent years, and luckily, I have some of those in my personal portfolio. Time: 05:09 - 05:14 But this just goes to show, you can't just leave individual stock investing down to luck. You have to be strategic with your stock picks, and even then, the market is unpredictable. If you wanna try this out, just download trading two one two. It's a great app for beginner investors because it lets you use a demo account to practice trading with fake money. Time: 05:15 - 05:34 This way, you can learn how it all works without risking any real cash, just like I mentioned earlier. It also lets you set up a stocks and shares ISA if you're in The UK, which protects your investment returns from taxes. But, again, I'm not a tax advisor, so please do your own research as everyone's situation is unique. Trading two one two also lets you buy fractional shares, which means you don't have to buy a whole stock. That's how I was able to own just naught point naught seven of a Samsung stock instead of having to buy an entire share. As I was gonna mention trading two one two anyway, I reached out to see if they'd be interested in sponsoring this portion of the video. They agreed and are offering a free fractional share worth up to a hundred pound to anyone that uses the code Tilbury when they create an account. Plus, you can get more free shares by inviting your friends. Both of you will get a free share as long as they fund their account. I'll leave the link in the description if you're interested. Time: 05:34 - 06:28 Second is a real estate investment trust, otherwise known as a REIT. I know this one sounds pretty complicated, but it's actually quite cool. Imagine your friend collects a hundred dollars from 3,000 people, giving him $300,000. Time: 06:31 - 06:47 He then uses that money to buy a property, rents it out, and shares the rental income with all 3,000 people who helped him buy it. That's a simple way to explain a REIT. It allows anyone to invest in properties without needing to buy one themselves. Think of it like you own the front door, someone else owns a window, and a few others own the bricks, which means together, everyone owns the entire property and shares in the profits. The learning curve, I'm gonna say it's moderate, and that's because getting started with REITs is much easier than buying physical property. It's not like you need a huge down payment or a mortgage, and there's no need to deal with agents or solicitors. Time: 06:47 - 07:26 However, you do need to understand how REITs work. They own things like offices, shopping centers, apartments, hotels, and much more, and they get their income through rent. For passive income potential, Time: 07:27 - 07:39 I'm gonna say this is great. REITs are well known for paying high dividends. This is because the law says they have to pass on at least 90% Time: 07:39 - 07:48 of all their profits to investors. So as long as the REIT is doing well and its properties are rented out, you can earn a steady stream of passive income. Most businesses sign long term leases on their commercial properties. Time: 07:48 - 08:00 Therefore, most of the time, income is pretty stable and reliable. Time: 08:00 - 08:04 But, of course, just keep in mind that your earnings depend on the REIT you pick and the types of properties it owns. For tax efficiency, Time: 08:04 - 08:11 I'm gonna put this down as great. This is because in many countries, REITs offer great tax benefits. For example, in The UK, you can hold REITs in a stocks and shares ISA, which means you don't have to pay taxes on your profits or dividends. In terms of risk, I'd have to say this is medium. REITs are generally less risky than buying a single property because they invest in multiple properties spreading out the risk. However, they're not risk free. If the real estate market takes a downturn or if the REIT struggles to keep its properties rented, you might see both a drop in dividends and the value of the investment. So what's my investment worth now? Let's flashback to me making the investment four years ago. As I'm in The UK, I'm gonna use the trading two one two website to put a hundred dollars into a similar REIT. Ready for the moment of truth? Looking at my investment now, I can see it's worth $98.59. Time: 08:11 - 09:06 So that's a a small loss of 1.41%. Time: 09:06 - 09:10 This shows that even though REITs are normally more stable than individual stocks, they're not guaranteed to perform well. Time: 09:10 - 09:16 My REIT likely underperformed because it invested in commercial real estate, which struggled during the pandemic. But that's not the end of the world as I made $11.93 Time: 09:16 - 09:26 back in dividends, meaning I'm actually $10.52 Time: 09:26 - 09:31 up. So that's Time: 09:31 - 09:32 10.52% Time: 09:34 - 09:36 up. Time: 09:36 - 09:37 Third Time: 09:40 - 09:40 is cryptocurrency. Time: 09:40 - 09:41 Imagine a form of digital money that isn't controlled by any government or bank. That's what cryptocurrencies Time: 09:42 - 09:48 like Bitcoin and Ethereum are. These currencies run on the blockchain technology, which makes them secure, transparent, and almost impossible to counterfeit. Cryptocurrencies Time: 09:48 - 09:58 have created massive wealth for some people with Bitcoin being the best performing asset of the last decade. But on the flip side, it's highly volatile, and people have also lost fortunes. That's why I describe crypto as part investment and part speculation Time: 09:58 - 10:14 and not for the faint hearted. For learning curve, I'm gonna say it's moderate. Crypto might sound complicated, but I'll break it down for you. First, you'll need a wallet. This is where you store your crypto. Think of it like a digital piggy bank, and there are different types. First are online wallets. These are easy to use, but you'll need to protect them with very strong passwords. Time: 10:14 - 10:36 Second are offline wallets, Time: 10:36 - 10:38 like hardware wallets. These are the safest because they're not connected to the Internet. Next, you'll need to pick an exchange to buy and sell your crypto. Some popular ones are Coinbase and Binance. Time: 10:39 - 10:49 These platforms make it simple to trade, but make sure to choose a trustworthy exchange to avoid any issues. Then there's tokenomics. Time: 10:50 - 10:57 This just means understanding how the supply and demand of a coin works. For example, Bitcoin has a limited supply, which is why it's often called digital gold. For passive income potential, Time: 10:58 - 11:08 I'm gonna also say this is moderate. Unlike stocks or REITs, crypto doesn't pay dividends, but there are ways to earn passive income. Time: 11:09 - 11:17 The first is called staking. This is when you lock up your crypto like Ethereum to help the system work and process transactions. Time: 11:17 - 11:25 In return, you get paid rewards, Time: 11:25 - 11:27 kind of like earning points for helping out. The second is yield farming. This is when you lend your crypto out to others and earn interest on it, similar to how a bank pays you interest when you save money with them. These methods can generate decent returns, but they do come with higher risks. Time: 11:28 - 11:43 If the coin's value drops or the platform you're using gets hacked, your income could disappear along with your crypto. That's why I personally don't mess with any of this and just hold mine on a ledger wallet. For tax efficiency, Time: 11:43 - 11:55 I'm gonna have to say this one is poor. Taxes are a tricky part of crypto investing. Time: 11:57 - 12:01 In many countries, even swapping one cryptocurrency Time: 12:02 - 12:04 for another counts as a taxable event. And if you are in staking rewards, those are also taxed as income. You also can't hold crypto in tax advantaged accounts like ISIS or Roth IRAs, which makes it less tax efficient than stocks or REITs. In terms of risk, Time: 12:05 - 12:21 I'd have to say it's very high. Crypto is one of the most volatile investments out there. Prices can soar a % in a year, but they can also crash just as fast. Personally, Time: 12:21 - 12:32 I just invest in Bitcoin and Ethereum as they're more established and often referred to as blue chip cryptocurrencies. Time: 12:32 - 12:38 Smaller altcoins can be far more risky. You've also got to be cautious of scams. Since crypto isn't regulated, if someone hacks your wallet or tricks you into sending your coins, there's no way to get them back. So keeping your crypto safe is just as important as learning how to invest in it. So what's my investment worth now? Let's rewind to when I made this investment four years ago. So I'm gonna jump onto the most popular coin app, which is called Coinbase, and invest my hundred dollars in Bitcoin and forget about it. Time: 12:39 - 13:09 Ready for the reveal? The $100 Time: 13:10 - 13:13 I invested in Bitcoin is now worth $652.24. Time: 13:13 - 13:18 That's a return of Time: 13:18 - 13:20 552.24 Time: 13:20 - 13:23 percent. Now I know what you're thinking. Time: 13:23 - 13:25 That's insane, and it is. But I have to stress that this kind of growth is not typical. Bitcoin has been the best performing asset of the last decade, Time: 13:26 - 13:34 but most cryptocurrencies Time: 13:35 - 13:36 don't see these kinds of returns. Time: 13:36 - 13:38 Many lose their value entirely. In my opinion, crypto is exciting, and the technology behind it has the potential to transform Time: 13:38 - 13:46 industries. Time: 13:46 - 13:47 However, it's not for everyone. It's highly volatile, Time: 13:47 - 13:50 speculative, and requires a strong stomach to handle the wild price swings. Just remember, crypto is all about high risk and high reward. So if you're gonna dive in, make sure you're doing your research and investing wisely. Time: 13:51 - 14:03 Fourth Time: 14:07 - 14:07 is gold. This is one of the oldest and most trusted ways to store and protect wealth. Time: 14:08 - 14:13 Gold is often called a safe haven because it's a great way to protect your wealth during uncertain times, like when inflation is rising or the economy is struggling. For learning curve, I'm gonna have to say it's low. Learning how to invest in gold is pretty simple. You have two main options. First, physical gold. This includes gold bars and coins. Time: 14:14 - 14:35 Many people also think you can buy gold jewelry as investments, but you'll often pay more than the gold is actually worth because sellers add a markup for their craftsmanship. Time: 14:36 - 14:45 For this reason, I personally stick to gold coins. Just bear in mind, if you pick this option, then you'd have to store it somewhere safe. Second is gold ETFs. Time: 14:45 - 14:55 These are funds that let you invest in gold without physically owning it. For example, in The UK, you can use trading two one two to buy shares in something like the iShares physical gold ETF. Time: 14:55 - 15:06 It's quick, easy, and you can buy or sell it with just a few clicks. Passive income potential is absolutely Time: 15:06 - 15:13 zero. Unlike stocks, REITs, or crypto, gold doesn't pay any passive income. It's not an income generating asset. It's purely a store of value. For tax efficiency, Time: 15:14 - 15:25 I'm gonna put this as good. If you buy physical gold like gold coins or bars, the tax rules can be a little tricky. Time: 15:26 - 15:33 For example, in some countries, certain gold coins like The UK's Gold Britannias Time: 15:33 - 15:38 are considered legal tender, which means you don't pay capital gains tax when you sell them. However, this doesn't apply to all gold coins or bars, so you'll need to check the specific rules in your country. For gold ETFs, they're generally more straightforward. Time: 15:38 - 15:53 In countries like The UK, you can hold them in a stocks and shares ISA, which makes any profits completely tax free. Interestingly, Time: 15:53 - 16:01 physical gold has another unique advantage. It can be used to transport wealth across borders discreetly. That said, this approach comes with risk, such as theft or legal restrictions on transporting large amounts of gold across borders. While it's not something I'd necessarily recommend, it's worth mentioning as a unique aspect of owning physical gold. In terms of risk, Time: 16:01 - 16:23 I'd say this is a medium. Gold is one of the safest investments you can make. It's been used as a form of money for thousands of years, and it's known to hold its value during times of inflation or economic uncertainty. Time: 16:24 - 16:36 However, Time: 16:37 - 16:37 the opportunity cost of investing in gold can be a downside. Time: 16:38 - 16:41 While it's great for protecting your wealth, it doesn't have the same growth potential as other investments like stocks or crypto. Time: 16:42 - 16:48 So what's my investment worth now? Let's flashback to when I made this investment four years ago. I'm gonna invest using trading two one two in a similar share. And with just a click of a button, there you go. I'm now mister Goldman. So what's mister Goldman's investment worth today? Well, it's currently sitting at a hundred and $40.10. Time: 16:49 - 17:09 That's a return of Time: 17:09 - 17:11 40.1%. Time: 17:11 - 17:13 Now that's not as exciting as Bitcoin's performance, but it's solid, steady growth. This shows how gold is better for protecting your wealth rather than rapidly growing it. Time: 17:13 - 17:24 Fifth Time: 17:26 - 17:27 is index funds. Imagine owning a tiny piece of the largest companies like Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon all at once. Time: 17:28 - 17:36 That's exactly what an index fund allows you to do. It's a basket of stocks that mirrors the performance of a specific index like the S and P five hundred. So you're investing in the overall market Time: 17:36 - 17:47 rather than betting on individual companies. For learning curve, I'm gonna have to say this one is low. Unlike individual stocks where you need to dig into the financial statements and company performance, Time: 17:47 - 17:59 index funds are passive investments. Time: 17:59 - 18:01 You don't have to pick and choose stocks as they're already bundled together for you. Getting started is simple too. Time: 18:01 - 18:08 Platforms like Trading two one two let you buy index funds with just a few clicks. Time: 18:08 - 18:13 Once you've invested, all you need to do is sit back and let the market do the work. For passive income potential, Time: 18:13 - 18:19 I'm gonna say this is moderate. Index funds don't directly pay high dividends like REITs, but they still provide some income. Many companies in the fund pay dividends, and those are automatically Time: 18:20 - 18:31 distributed to you or reinvested back into the fund depending on your choice. Time: 18:32 - 18:36 While the main focus of index funds is long term growth, the dividend income can be a nice bonus, especially if you're investing in funds that focus on dividend paying companies. For tax efficiency, Time: 18:37 - 18:48 I'm gonna say this one is great. If you hold index funds in a stocks and shares ISA in The UK or a Roth IRA in The USA, you can avoid paying taxes on dividends and capital gains altogether. Time: 18:48 - 19:00 This means you get to keep more of your profits over time, which can make a huge difference when you're investing for the long haul. Time: 19:01 - 19:07 In terms of risks, I'd Time: 19:08 - 19:10 say it's pretty low. Index funds are much less risky than investing in individual stocks because they're diversified. Time: 19:10 - 19:16 Instead of putting all your money into a few companies, you're spreading it across hundreds or even thousands of stocks in different industries. Historically, the S and P five hundred has delivered average annual returns of around eight to 10% over the long term. While the market can go up and down in the short term, if you hold on to an index fund for ten, twenty, or even thirty years, it's one of the safest ways to grow your wealth. However, of course, there are still risks like with any investment. So what's my investment worth now? Let's rewind to when I made this investment four years ago. If we head over to Vanguard's website now and we find the S and P 500 and deposit some money and then click, there you go. Job done. Right. So time for the reveal. Time: 19:17 - 20:01 Today, that investment is worth a hundred and $79.57. Time: 20:01 - 20:06 That's a return of Time: 20:07 - 20:08 79.57%. Time: 20:09 - 20:11 This result shows why index funds are such a great option for most investors. Time: 20:11 - 20:15 They're simple, low cost, and consistently deliver solid returns over time. Time: 20:16 - 20:20 Personally, index funds are my favorite investment, which is why I've allocated the majority of my money there. Time: 20:21 - 20:27 However, I also understand the importance of diversification, Time: 20:28 - 20:31 so I spread smaller percentages across all the other investments we've discussed today. This way, I can balance growth, stability, and risk in my portfolio. So whether you're diving into individual stocks, buying some REITs, exploring crypto, getting into gold, or sticking with the steady reliability of index funds, Time: 20:32 - 20:50 each investment has its pros and cons. Time: 20:51 - 20:53 Some are better for growing your wealth quickly, while others are designed to protect it over the long term. The most important lesson is to start early. Time: 20:53 - 21:02 Even small amounts like the hundred dollars we've been working with can grow into something significant thanks to the power of compounding. Time is your best friend when it comes to investing, so don't wait to get started. If you wanna know what the laziest way to make money online is, then I'm gonna leave that video right up there. But don't click on it just yet. Make sure to subscribe if you wanna grow your wealth. Okay? I'll see you over there. Time: 21:02 - 21:24I am 53 and retired at 50. 1 thing I did do to retire early was to get out of the 401K and IRA programs.  Bought rental real-estate and I am now a Limited Partner in about 1500+ units from collaborative efforts in the fund my estate planner has me invested in. I do not work.",

      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:16 and finally die. Let's be real for a second. Do you think that's how I make $67,257 Time: 00:16 - 00:24 per week? There is clearly something else going on. And, no, I'm not talking about getting a high paid job or starting a side hustle. To achieve this, you need a way of making money that doesn't rely on you working day in, day out. It's called passive income, and here are seven ideas I strongly suggest you consider along with my ratings of each. Idea one, invest in stocks. There's a bit more to this than just invest in the stock market, and you'll make passive income. I mean, I can see why people might think this. Because let's say you buy a share in a company, and it goes up in value. Technically, you've generated some money without doing anything. But in order to actually get your cash out, you have to sell your stock. Some would consider this passive income, but instead, I just think of it as a bonus and not something to rely on. I consider passive income as nothing less than actual money flowing into your bank account every month without the need to sell the asset that's making you the money. That's why the only form of stock market investing I consider to be real passive income is Time: 00:24 - 01:23 dividend stocks. These are chunks of companies you can buy. Think Starbucks, Pepsi, and McDonald's. And in return for owning them, you get a share of the profits paid directly into your pocket as well as benefiting from the stock going up in value as a bit of a bonus. They're one of the easiest ways to make money on a consistent basis with absolutely no work. Well, that's as long as you pick the right ones to invest in. I strongly suggest you listen to this next part carefully so you avoid making any crucial mistakes. To help you sort the good from the bad, dividend stocks are ranked in a kind of social hierarchy. At the top, you have dividend kings. These are stocks that have not only paid a dividend, but actually increased it for fifty years in a row. Under that, you have the dividend aristocrats. Time: 01:24 - 02:08 These are the stocks that have increased their dividends for twenty five years. That's where the official definition stops, but I like to think of the stocks under this as dividend working class. Sure. Some of them will eventually become aristocrats and kings. However, it's very hard to tell which ones will make it. I'd be very cautious with these as a lot of people get drawn in by companies offering extremely high dividends. Time: 02:09 - 02:30 I can understand why. But remember, as much as it's about the amount of money you're being paid, it's also essential that it's sustainable Time: 02:31 - 02:39 long term. So you can easily compare these seven ideas. I'm gonna rate them in three different categories. Firstly, how much time does dividend investing take? I'll rate this a one out of five as all you have to do is download an investing app, deposit some money, and buy a few dividend stocks. Look. This isn't financial advice, but some apps I'd recommend are Moomoo for The USA and Lightyear for The UK and Europe. Time: 02:39 - 03:02 Apps like these often give out free stocks for joining. So if I find any, then I'll pop them down in the description below. Secondly, how much money do you need? I'll give this a five out of five. As it's so quick to do, the trade off is that you need a lot of money invested to make a significant income. Thirdly, Time: 03:03 - 03:19 how easy is it to make a hundred dollars per week? This also gets a five out of five. Let's do the maths. As dividends are calculated on a yearly basis and are paid out at the end of each quarter, let's first work out how much money you need per year, which is pretty simple. There are fifty two weeks in a year, so let's multiply that by a hundred, which gives us $5,200. Time: 03:19 - 03:40 Now let's say we invest in one of my favorite companies, Starbucks, Time: 03:40 - 03:44 who currently pay an annual dividend of 2.4%. Time: 03:44 - 03:47 In order to make $5,200 Time: 03:48 - 03:51 per year or a hundred dollars per week, you would need to invest a grand total of, wait for it, $216,666. Time: 03:51 - 04:01 Now I know what you're thinking. This sounds great for people that already have money, but what if I'm just starting out? In that case, it's a much better idea to use your time instead of your money to make passive income, which is what the next idea is all about. Idea two, Time: 04:01 - 04:16 automate a side hustle. A lot of people don't understand the difference between a job and an automated side hustle. When I was younger, I had a friend called Jamie who had a small dog training business. He was fantastic at what he did. I remember him seeing Tame the craziest of dogs. One day when we were sitting in the park, I asked him how much money he made, and I was surprised to find out he was only just getting by. It didn't really make sense to me how such a skilled person who obviously had a lot of value to give was unable to make the money he deserved. But if we put aside the fact that he probably wasn't charging enough, we get to the real issue, which was the business model. He only had a limited amount of hours he could sell and dogs he could train. Time: 04:16 - 04:57 Therefore, he could only earn so much before his potential was capped as at the time, there was no way to automate and scale it. But now we have the Internet, these little side hustles can become much more passive and make a lot more money. So how do you go from having a skill like Jamie to having an automated side hustle? Well, here's the steps I'd take, and I'm pretty sure I could turn a small side hustle like Jamie's into a million dollar business nowadays. Time: 04:57 - 05:21 Firstly, you have to identify what you're really good at. Ideally, you should have some kind of unfair advantage, but this is where the majority of people get caught in the same trap as Jamie as they start to sell every minute of their time for a small amount of money. Instead, you need to focus every waking hour on building a digital asset of some kind. For Jamie, this could have been a blog where he talked about training dogs, Time: 05:21 - 05:44 a manual for owners to train their own pets, or a course that teaches other people how to start a a dog training side hustle. Secondly, when you've decided what kind of digital asset you want to build, you have to put it on the Internet so that your future customers can find it. The best solution I found for this is a tool called Hostinger, which is an all in one platform. I'm talking hosting, Time: 05:45 - 06:06 website builder, logo maker, and free domain name with annual plans. I've personally choose this as the drag and drop website builder makes it so easy as I don't have any coding skills. Then it's just a case of effectively advertising your digital product on social media. I'd highly recommend making viral TikToks about your product as you can reach so many people without too much time and effort. So how much time does automating a side hustle take? Well, if you're doing it on your own, I'd give it a five out of five as it does take a while to build a digital product, and then you have the added headache of making a website. However, if you do decide to use something like Hostinger, then I'd give this a three out of five as you don't need to worry about having any technical or design skills for the website as you can just use the built in AI website builder to make the website for you. Or, alternatively, Time: 06:06 - 06:55 you could use the designer made templates, which is great news for a boomer like me. But for the people that are a bit more knowledgeable, you can further grow your website by choosing the WordPress option. Now let's talk about how much money you need. I'd give this a one out of five as this passive income idea is way more about spending your time than your money. It depends what digital product you wanna build, but if it's just a course of some kind, you can do all of that on your laptop using a program like Canva. When it comes to hosting it on the Internet, if you get hosting as twenty four month plan, then it comes out at less than $3 a month. I've actually been using Hostinger for a while now, so I thought, as I was mentioning it so much in the video, why not reach out to them and see if I could get a discount? They actually did get back to me. So if you use the code Mark Tilbury, you'll get an additional 10% off. I'll leave a link in the description below. Finally, the part that everyone wants to know. How easy is it to make a hundred dollars a week? I'd give this a one out of five. Because once you're up and running, let's say you price your digital product at $25. Time: 06:56 - 07:55 All you have to do is make four sales a week, and you've made a hundred bucks. So within a couple of weeks, you can make all your money back and then start making profit. This is easy enough if you're posting TikTok videos every day. You might even get a really viral one and end up making way more sales than you initially expected, Time: 07:55 - 08:12 and that brings me perfectly onto idea three, make online content. For decades, millions upon millions of dollars have been hoarded by the traditional media. I'm talking about the radio stations and television networks. The public had no idea how much money was in advertising until YouTube opened their doors for the public to create their own content. Then the curtain was well and truly lifted. The traditional media hate it, and that's why every opportunity, they try and discredit social media. Time: 08:13 - 08:41 The people leveraging online content are dipping their hands into the previously extremely guarded money pot and rightfully taking their fair share. It still shocks me how some people don't understand how content creators make money. I mean, the concept of advertising is hundreds of years old, and online ads are far more trackable than just putting a random advert on the TV and hoping it increases a business's sales. Here's the best piece of advice I've received about social media. It's not if you do it, it's how well you do it. So how can we use it to make money? Well, it's like I've previously mentioned. You can start a YouTube channel, and once you reach a thousand subscribers and 4,000 watch hours, you can start getting paid from the adverts on your videos. Whenever I say this to people, they come back with something like, well, the people that succeed are just lucky. Maybe this was the case a couple of years ago, but now if your content's good and designed for the algorithm, Time: 08:42 - 09:35 you will be successful. The harsh truth is too many people think their content is good when it's actually just terrible, and no one wants to tell them this. This is because they only ask family and friends who sugarcoat the truth to protect their feelings. Time: 09:36 - 09:48 If you want an honest judgment, you need to ask people who don't care about offending you. Care more about people who don't care about you. It's best to pick whatever you feel the most comfortable with. Be that writing, taking photos, speaking into a microphone, or recording a full blown video. As long as you can capture people's attention, then you're onto a winner. It's also worth mentioning that picking a niche is important. Time: 09:49 - 10:13 In the early days of the Internet, you could get away with talking about anything and everything, but now there is so much competition that you need to specialize in something in particular. Think about it like your favorite TV show. Every time you tune in, you kinda know what to expect, Time: 10:13 - 10:29 similar characters, locations, and storylines. Time: 10:29 - 10:31 So you wanna make sure your viewers know what kind of content you produce and put it out on a regular basis. This also makes it a lot easier for you to attract sponsorship opportunities. I like to think of every video I put on this channel as a little asset that will make me money for years to come. It also helps that it's extremely fun to make content. So how much time does content creation take? I'm gonna give this a five out of five rating as it's one of the most time consuming things in the world. I'm not gonna beat around the bush, but making content is a long, hard process. I mean, this video has probably taken us more than five days to produce. However, the upsides are worth it in my opinion. Just think, the harder that something is to do, the less competition you actually have. Now how much money do you need? This is a one out of five as you really don't need much to start. I see way too many people buying the latest equipment or going on crazy long courses to learn how to create content. This is a terrible idea. You just need to become an avid consumer of whatever you want to create. Take the good parts from all of those different things and then mix them with your own ideas. Time: 10:32 - 11:39 There's a great book about this called Still Like an Artist. Most importantly, Time: 11:39 - 11:44 how easy is it to make a hundred dollars a week? Well, this has to be a one out of five too. Within a couple of months of starting this YouTube channel, it was able to make more than a hundred dollars per day, and you can do the same. No wonder the traditional media wanted to hoard all this money for themselves. Time: 11:44 - 12:00 The opportunity Time: 12:00 - 12:01 is insane. Time: 12:02 - 12:02 Idea four, start private investing. Now I want you to imagine you're an investor on Shark Tank. An entrepreneur walks in with an incredible business you think you can help with, and they're looking for some money to expand. Time: 12:03 - 12:16 You have the opportunity to get in on the ground floor of this business. Time: 12:16 - 12:20 Are you gonna take the risk? How about if you're having a conversation with a family member and they share their plan for a world dominating business, and they just need a small amount of money to start? If you answered yes, then private investing could be for you. Your first step is deciding which kind of private investor you are. There are two main types, sharks and angels. Some stay angels, and some morph into sharks, but it'll help you to know the difference. Angels often invest in businesses run by friends and family. They often don't have lots of money nor an interest in taking control of the business. They're generally seen as nicer and more forgiving, Time: 12:20 - 12:55 hence their name. On the other hand, sharks may invest small amounts of money but have deeper pockets. They may also seek a controlling interest at the start as they're confident their expertise can make the business more profitable and therefore grow their investment. I'm personally more inclined towards the shark end of the spectrum as I like to have as much control over my investments as possible. Time: 12:55 - 13:17 But whichever private investment strategy you pick, you can also combine it with content creation. Believe it or not, the actor Ryan Reynolds is a great example of this. He's one of the smartest people on the planet right now, and I'm not exaggerating. Time: 13:17 - 13:30 He's extremely good at playing the everyday guy. But under the mask, he's a business savvy venture capitalist with many multimillion dollar exits under his belt, giving him a net worth of over $350,000,000 Time: 13:31 - 13:45 He finds interesting companies, offers to buy a small percentage as an angel investor, Time: 13:45 - 13:50 uses his social media to drive up the value, and then when the company sells, he gets a huge check for tens of millions of dollars. And this is almost all passive income. Time: 13:51 - 14:01 It's genius. Now, of course, Ryan is a worldwide star, but you can replicate this strategy on a smaller scale and use it to make a lot of passive income. I mean, even if you could replicate 1% of his success, that would give you a net worth of $3,500,000. Time: 14:01 - 14:19 So how much time does private investing take? I'm gonna give this, Time: 14:19 - 14:22 2.5 Time: 14:23 - 14:24 out of five as it takes a while to find a business that you really believe is worth investing in. Don't just jump into anything. Take your time and carefully consider if you can see that business being successful in the future. You also have to ask the entrepreneur how dividends will be paid and their ultimate exit strategy as that's how you're gonna get the majority of your money. The actual investing part doesn't take long as it's just a case of handing over the money and being assigned your percentage of the business. Now how much money do you need? I'm gonna give this a three out of five as it really depends on the business that you're investing in. I've personally invested anywhere between a thousand and a hundred thousand dollars. Of course, the earlier you get in, the less you're going to have to invest, but also the more risk you're taking. So you have to decide how much risk you're willing to take. Time: 14:24 - 15:11 If you do this, I'd also recommend making more than one investment as I've often found that one good investment can make up for nine bad ones. But importantly, Time: 15:12 - 15:20 how easy is it to make a hundred dollars a week? I'm gonna rate this a two out of five as it really depends on your negotiation Time: 15:21 - 15:27 skill and how much you invest. Time: 15:28 - 15:29 I've invested 5,000 in a business and helped them to upgrade their equipment as well as helping them grow their client base. I started making an easy hundred dollars per week in dividends. Time: 15:30 - 15:40 The more value you can offer, the more you'll get in return as you aren't taking money out of the entrepreneur's pocket, but instead helping to grow the pot of money for everyone. Idea five, become an affiliate marketer. I remember when recently a big bank had a promotion. Time: 15:40 - 15:55 My son's girlfriend sent a sign up link to all of her friends, letting them know they downloaded the app, they could get a free $10. She was shocked by the results. Every few hours, a new friend had signed up and thanked her for the free cash. Before she knew it, 30 of her friends had signed up using the link, and she'd hit the limit. Time: 15:56 - 16:12 But she wasn't just doing this out of the kindness of her heart, although she is a kind girl. She also got paid $10 for everyone that signed up, meaning that day, she made $300 Time: 16:13 - 16:24 just sitting in the bed texting a few people. Time: 16:24 - 16:27 Just imagine if there wasn't a limit. She could have made far more. This is essentially affiliate marketing, but real affiliate marketing doesn't have a limit, so you can make as much as you want. It's considered to be one of the simplest yet most profitable ways to make money online as it doesn't require you to have any extra skills or previous experience. All that's typically needed as an affiliate is a passion for your niche and strong persuasive Time: 16:27 - 16:51 skills. Think about all the products you love and maybe even use on a daily basis. Time: 16:51 - 16:57 The chances are that other people will also like those products, and you are the perfect person to sell it to them. Most big companies have an affiliate scheme, so all you have to do is go on to their website and do a bit of digging. Time: 16:57 - 17:09 If you can't find anything, then it's worth reaching out to them directly and asking if you can become an affiliate. There are also websites like impact.com, Time: 17:09 - 17:18 where you can see a lot of different affiliate schemes that you can easily sign up for. Now you have to make some noise. You can do this by writing blogs, using social media, or posting reviews. You may have already seen this done on TikTok with those videos about Amazon products you need to buy. Every time someone buys through your link, you as the affiliate marketer receive a kickback and make a profit. Time: 17:18 - 17:39 But bear in mind, if you're doing reviews, you should actually purchase the product and test it. Using it over a period of time and reporting your findings will make sure your content is useful and genuine. One thing to keep in mind before you start affiliate marketing is to consider how you can provide value to your audience that exceeds what you get in return. So how much time does affiliate marketing take? I'm gonna give this a 3.5 Time: 17:40 - 18:05 out of five. I'm not gonna lie. It's gonna be hard to begin with, so it's important to have realistic expectations. Time: 18:05 - 18:11 While it is a great way to make money online, it's not a get rich quick scheme. It requires patience and a willingness to learn. It's totally understandable Time: 18:12 - 18:21 to feel discouraged if you don't see results right away, but keep in mind that success in this field takes time. You need to build trust with your audience and create valuable content for them. Now how much money do you need? This gets a one out of five as you don't need any money whatsoever. That's assuming you already have a phone or a laptop you can use to access the Internet and make your content. But how easy is it to make a hundred dollars a week? I'm gonna give this a two out of five. If we take the example of my son's girlfriend, Time: 18:21 - 18:50 she was kinda doing affiliate marketing without even knowing, and she managed to make $300 Time: 18:50 - 18:56 in one day. Of course, this wasn't very passive as she was texting people. However, once you have your content up and running, it will do most of the heavy lifting for you. It's been reported that affiliate marketers earn an average of $66,029 Time: 18:56 - 19:10 per year Time: 19:10 - 19:11 passively, Time: 19:11 - 19:12 with earnings ranging from 35,000 Time: 19:12 - 19:15 up to a hundred and $24,000. Time: 19:15 - 19:18 Idea six, Time: 19:18 - 19:19 create Time: 19:20 - 19:20 a digital tool. My best friend decided to do this, and now he's a multimillionaire Time: 19:20 - 19:25 who spends more time on vacation with his wife than he does at home. He noticed a gap in the market for a digital tool that helped large membership organizations Time: 19:25 - 19:33 keep track of all their customers' data. At first, he decided to sell his software as a one time purchase. However, he always had to search for a new customer. Time: 19:34 - 19:43 When he made the switch to a subscription based model, he was able to make a very predictable amount of passive income every month. When I say passive income, of course, he still had to offer support to his customers, but eventually, he hired people to do this for him and was completely hands off. He later went on to sell his business for multiple millions. Before you start thinking you have to be some kind of nerd to create a digital tool, hear me out. The most important thing to do is to identify a problem that needs solving. Time: 19:43 - 20:12 Often, you find people who have the ability to code aren't that creative and need a lot of direction. Time: 20:13 - 20:18 So if you can't code, then you can be the ideas person, Time: 20:18 - 20:22 the business brain behind the talent. You then need to pick the customers your software is going to serve. There are two main categories, business or consumers. Time: 20:22 - 20:30 Serving other businesses is often seen as the least risky, and you can make more money per customer. When you've got this, you'll really be able to see how people respond to your solution. Time: 20:31 - 20:40 You've got to make sure you aren't too attached to your ideas as you may find it doesn't actually fix the problem you intended. Therefore, it's very important to be able to adapt your digital tool after receiving criticism. Even if this isn't something you think you can start right now, it's worth just noting down problems you see businesses are facing just in case you stumble upon a solution no one has thought of before. So how much time does creating a digital tool take? I'm gonna give this a five out of five. Not only does the process of coming up with the idea take a long time, so does the testing and the building of the tool. So if you decide to go down this route, I don't want you to be under any illusions. Make sure you don't sink years into building the final tool before testing it, though. I've seen way too many people do this and realize they've actually just ended up wasting years of their life on something Time: 20:40 - 21:30 no one wants. But like I mentioned with my friend, if you do manage to build an amazing digital tool, then it will pay you a consistent stream of passive income, Time: 21:31 - 21:39 and you'll have the added benefit of being able to sell it for potentially Time: 21:40 - 21:43 millions. Now how much money do you need? I'm gonna give this a 3.5 Time: 21:44 - 21:49 out of five, as making anything like this is gonna cost you a decent amount of money. However, there are two things you can do to bring down your costs. Time: 21:49 - 21:57 Firstly, you can partner with a coder, and therefore, you won't have to pay for his time, but you will have to give away equity. Secondly, once you've made your first version of your product or MVP, Time: 21:57 - 22:08 if it's good, you'll start to get some interest from angel investors. At this point, you have to make the decision to either keep using your own money, known as bootstrapping, Time: 22:08 - 22:17 or take on investment in return for giving away equity in your business. But the big question, Time: 22:18 - 22:24 how easy is it to make a hundred dollars per week? This is a one out of five. Time: 22:24 - 22:28 If you manage to build and fund it to the stage where it can be released to the market and were to price your subscription at $20 a month, then you'd only need 20 paying customers, and you'll be making a hundred dollars a week. Of course, you will have other expenses, but these will be limited to customer support and software updates. It's also likely you'll charge a lot more than $20 a month and have a lot more than 20 customers. Time: 22:29 - 22:51 I must spend at least a thousand dollars a month on digital tools, so the money's definitely out there. So we've talked about investing in assets and building your own, but one thing that often gets overlooked is actually making money from the assets you already own, which brings me on to idea seven, Time: 22:52 - 23:08 rent out your stuff. Most people don't realize that they're sitting on a gold mine that could already own what they need to make some passive income. I remember a few years ago, one of my friends revealed to me that he was struggling to pay his bills. Time: 23:09 - 23:21 I then suggested that he rented out his driveway to make some passive income. He looked at me and laughed, but then a few weeks later, he texted me back and said it was working amazingly. This is because he lived near Bromley Train Station, which meant he could charge people $70 a week to leave their car on his drive when they went to London to work. He had capacity for two cars, so he was actually able to make a hundred and $40 a week in extra passive income. I'm aware not everyone has a a driveway to rent out, but most people have something they could use to make money. Make a list of everything you own and see if anything jumps out at you. A few ideas that come to mind are storage space, such as an attic or a basement, Time: 23:21 - 24:00 a vehicle, Time: 24:01 - 24:01 camping equipment, camera gear, a garage, or a spare room in your house, or dare I say it, money. Of course, you could always go down the route of buying a second property to rent out, but you would need a considerable amount of money to do that. The world is definitely becoming more familiar with renting things as things are getting more increasingly expensive. Renting out your stuff can be a great way to actually justify buying the asset in the first place. I mean, if I knew that an expensive camera would pay for itself after a certain amount of rentals, then it makes sense to buy it. Once you've thought of what you can rent to others, all you need to do is find an app that matches you with potential customers. There are so many of these in the past that I've used FatLama to rent camera equipment and camping gear, Time: 24:02 - 24:45 Touro to rent vehicles, and Airbnb to hire filming locations. Peer to peer lending platforms also make it possible for you to essentially Time: 24:45 - 24:53 rent out your money to others. While it does involve some risk, many lenders have successfully generated a nice income from this investment. Time: 24:54 - 25:01 For example, Prosper, one of the leading platforms, has an average historical return of 5.4%. Time: 25:02 - 25:08 So if you're willing to take a bit of a risk, this could be a great option to explore. So how much time does renting something out take? I'll give this a one out of five because all you have to do is take a few pictures and upload them to an app or a website that does all the work for you. The biggest drawback of this is the potential risk involved. Time: 25:08 - 25:26 Not everyone will take the same degree of care with your items as you would. That's why having some kind of insurance is important. Time: 25:26 - 25:33 Normally, this comes with the platform that you decide to use. Now how much money do you need? I'll also give this a one out of five because if you're just renting out things you already own, then it's not gonna cost you anything. The only cost will be if you decide to get separate insurance or you decide you wanna buy things in order to rent them out. And the big question, Time: 25:34 - 25:54 how easy is it to make a hundred dollars a week? I'd give this a two out of five as it's very easy if you have enough assets to rent out. Most people have a house they can use to make an extra hundred dollars a week, even if that means renting out a driveway or a spare room. If you'd like to know how you can get ahead of everyone else this year, then you can watch this video next, but don't click on it just yet. Make sure to subscribe if you wanna grow your wealth. Okay? I'll see you over there. Time: 25:54 - 26:20I'm sick of this mundane conventional knowledge, guys. Head to Borlest",

      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:37 a hundred thousand to a million, and a million to $10,000,000 Time: 00:38 - 00:42 if you apply them correctly. Level one, going from zero to a hundred thousand dollars. First, you need to master your mind. I didn't come from a wealthy background, and during my youth, I vividly remember people saying the phrase, money is the root of all evil. Secrets of the Millionaire Mind explains how these phrases program us to believe that rich people are the devil. It took me a long time to rid myself of the negative feeling in my stomach when I thought about making money. If I'd have read this book sooner, it would have helped me realize this issue earlier. Once I got over this hurdle, I had to ask myself, what is money actually for? Time: 00:42 - 01:19 For me, the answer was freedom. The psychology of money puts it a little differently and says it's all about control, but I suppose the goal is the same, to be able to do whatever you want whenever you want. It also touches on how there's a clear difference between the rich and the wealthy. Time: 01:19 - 01:35 Wealth is what you don't see. The cars not purchased, diamonds not bought, renovations Time: 01:36 - 01:41 postponed, Time: 01:41 - 01:41 clothes forgotten, and first class upgrades declined. Unfortunately, Time: 01:42 - 01:45 many people don't even believe that they can become wealthy. Time: 01:46 - 01:49 I remember my school friends saying things like, I hope I can get an okay job when I graduate. They weren't even hoping for a good one. The magic of thinking big explains that people are setting their finish line too soon and therefore never have a shot at being successful. Time: 01:49 - 02:04 While I don't believe that thinking big alone will make you successful, Time: 02:05 - 02:08 it's certainly the first step. I always struggled in school and felt like a failure. Time: 02:08 - 02:13 Interestingly, when I left and started working in the real world, I found that I kept winning. This was probably because I chose jobs I had an interest in rather than learning things I didn't care about at school. The winner effect talks about actual studies to back up this phenomenon. Time: 02:13 - 02:28 The book discusses how positive correlation has been found between successful stock market traders and their testosterone levels. Furthermore, winning increases the testosterone Time: 02:28 - 02:37 receptors in your brain, which causes you to win more in the future. That's why it's important to set those achievable goals and get those little wins every day. I believe that my struggles in school and my strong drive for success had a positive impact on my life. They left me with no other option but to push forward. Think and Grow Rich tells a story about a great commander. Time: 02:37 - 02:58 Despite being outnumbered by a far superior enemy, he burned his army's own ships, leaving them with no escape plan. This forced his soldiers to fight with everything they had, resulting in miraculous Time: 02:59 - 03:10 victory against all the odds. It just shows there's a big difference between wanting to succeed Time: 03:10 - 03:16 and needing to. Being comfortable is just as harmful as having an escape plan. During a chat with Andrew Tate, he referred to this as one of the Matrix's tools. Unscripted Time: 03:16 - 03:27 also presents this idea. Time: 03:28 - 03:29 The author argues that society aims to transform us into model citizens, which stands for mediocre, Time: 03:30 - 03:36 obedient, Time: 03:37 - 03:37 dependent, Time: 03:37 - 03:38 entertained, Time: 03:38 - 03:39 and lifeless. Time: 03:39 - 03:40 Avoiding this fate depends on how well you can manage stress. Time: 03:40 - 03:44 The essence of success Time: 03:44 - 03:45 gives us a helpful perspective on this. The book mentions that all the water that forms a fog that's a hundred feet deep and seven city blocks wide can fit into a small glass. Whenever I feel stressed, I like to imagine drinking this water and using it as fuel. Now you can develop great habits. Stress can also come from factors outside our control. For this reason, I've made a conscious effort throughout my life to only focus on things that I can directly impact. Atomic habits reveals that many people fixate on the end goal, which they have no control over, rather than the process of achieving it, which is completely in their hands. I found the author's habit stacking technique to be particularly helpful for forming new habits. It involves pairing a new habit with an existing one so both are completed at the same time. However, most people just keep putting things off and never form good habits. Time: 03:46 - 04:37 I know far too many people who just go through the motions without any direction, Time: 04:37 - 04:42 and before they know it, Time: 04:42 - 04:43 time has run out. The seven habits of highly effective people stresses the importance of always knowing where you're going and thinking about how you want to be remembered. I know this provides me with extra motivation, but this is only one part of the equation. Time: 04:44 - 04:58 The twelve week year suggests treating a year as twelve weeks to create a sense of urgency. This really hit home for me as I know I work best under pressure. Although short term pain is often necessary for long term gain, it can be difficult to remember this when faced with challenges. The art of getting things done emphasizes the importance of not relying on your brain to remember all your tasks. Instead, capture them on a phone or a notepad. Time: 04:58 - 05:24 This way, you can organize your task without getting them confused, and you can also be selective with how you spend your time. Essentialism Time: 05:24 - 05:32 reminds us that for every task we say yes to, we have to say no to many others. Therefore, it's important to value yes and not be afraid to say no. After adopting these habits, you should start building high value skills. I've previously said that I don't like the advice follow your passion. However, so good they can't ignore you takes it one step further. The author interviewed many people who loved their jobs. He found that most of them didn't initially have a passion for their work. Rather, as they improved, their love for their work grew. So what skills should you start building if you aren't necessarily following your passion? The unfair advantage suggests that to succeed in an unfair world, you need to play to your natural strengths, find what you're better at than most people, and lean into it. However, it's no longer enough to just possess high value skills. Time: 05:32 - 06:23 Artificial intelligence is rapidly replacing many jobs. Time: 06:24 - 06:28 I'm using it more and more in my various businesses to complete simple tasks. That's why the ideas shared in mastery are more important than ever. My main takeaway was that you need to develop a unique stack of skills that is nearly impossible to replicate. Time: 06:28 - 06:42 Still Like an Artist echoes this point when it suggests a copy from multiple inspirations until you have a mix that is truly original. Having this unique skill stack will give you the ability to earn a high income. Time: 06:42 - 06:55 However, that still won't mean you can build wealth without understanding the basics of personal finance. When I was younger, I had a mentor named Dave who taught me about how the rich manage their money. The biggest lesson I learned, which is also shared in Rich Dad Poor Dad, is that everything we buy is either an asset or a liability. To figure out which one it is, we simply have to ask ourselves, Time: 06:55 - 07:18 is it putting money in our pocket or taking it away? Of course, if you want to be wealthy, the aim should be to buy as many assets as possible, Time: 07:18 - 07:26 but lots of people don't see the value of investing. Let me ask you this. Would you rather have $3,000,000 Time: 07:26 - 07:32 now Time: 07:32 - 07:32 or a penny that doubles every day for thirty one days? The correct answer is the penny because it actually turns into $10,700,000 Time: 07:33 - 07:42 The compound effect uses this analogy to demonstrate the power of investing and gaining compound interest. Once most people get their head around this, they get very excited, but end up jumping into the markets without really understanding anything. That's what happened in the pandemic. Everyone thought they knew what they were doing, but it was just a massive bubble waiting to burst. That's why I've always followed the principles laid out in the Time: 07:42 - 08:03 market is a losing game. Instead, you should own the entire market. You can do this by investing in something like the S and P five hundred or a broad market index fund. Interestingly, Time: 08:08 - 08:18 over a thirty five year period, only 1% of mutual funds could beat the market by 2%. Time: 08:19 - 08:24 This means that index funds are a clear choice for the average investor. Although, as I do find them pretty boring, I also like to invest in more interesting stocks with a smaller part of my money. Time: 08:24 - 08:35 Whenever I do this, I keep in mind that the market is irrational. As the intelligent investor puts it, you should imagine a person coming to your door every day called Mr. Market. One day, he may offer you $2,000 Time: 08:36 - 08:49 for your stock, and the next, only 500, Time: 08:49 - 08:52 even though the company may be doing better than ever. This is because the price of the stock is based on demand and not the actual real world value. I only buy stocks if I'm prepared to ignore what Mr. Market says for a long time. Another phrase I live by is, if you love the store, chances are you'll love the stock, which was shared in one up on Wall Street. This means if you've got a lot of experience of a company or product, you might actually have a bigger advantage than the pros when it comes to investing. Before we get to the next level, I have to make one thing clear. Reading books on investing can provide you with theoretical knowledge, but to truly succeed in investing and build wealth, you need to put that knowledge into practice. So if you are going to invest, you need to make sure that you're using a tool that provides you with all the necessary information to make informed decisions. This is where today's sponsor, Moomoo, comes in. If you're interested in building wealth, then you're really gonna wanna listen to this. It's a powerful investing platform founded in Silicon Valley with over 20,000,000 users worldwide. You can trade stocks straight from your laptop, iPad, or smartphone, Time: 08:52 - 09:56 whether in The United States, Australia, or Singapore. Time: 09:56 - 09:59 You also don't have to worry about commission fees and account minimums. I personally really like the free tool they offer, which allows you to see what famous institutions are Time: 10:00 - 10:09 and what sectors are performing best. As a beginner, you can also practice your trading ideas with a demo account before entering the market. If you sign up today using the link in the description, you can receive up to 15 free stocks, each worth between Time: 10:10 - 10:24 three and two thousand dollars That's an amazing deal. These three stocks can help you start building your investment portfolio right away. Level 2, 1 hundred thousand Time: 10:24 - 10:34 to $1,000,000 Time: 10:34 - 10:36 Now that you've fixed all your internal beliefs, Time: 10:36 - 10:38 to make the next leap, you'll need to know how to generate more value than you can from just selling your time. We're taught to go to school, get good grades, and then get a high paying job. However, when you do this, your earning ability is capped. Cash flow quadrant outlines four distinct ways to earn money, e for employee, Time: 10:39 - 10:58 s for self employed, b for business owner, and I for investor. Business owners and investors have the advantage of using other people's time and money to build their wealth. That's why it's crucial to move to the right side of the quadrant if you want to become rich. But what does it really mean to be rich? Well, the four Hour Workweek explains this best when it says that relative income trumps absolute income. To understand this statement, let me ask you a question. Time: 10:58 - 11:24 An investment banker earns 500,000 Time: 11:25 - 11:27 per year working eighty hours a week. Time: 11:27 - 11:30 On the other hand, an ecommerce entrepreneur earns 40,000 per year, but only works four hours per week. Who's richer? If we look solely at absolute income, then the banker is clearly making more money. However, if we consider the time worked, the banker earns $120 Time: 11:30 - 11:48 per hour, whereas the entrepreneur earns $200 Time: 11:48 - 11:51 per hour. To take it one step further, the entrepreneur can actually already live the retired life that the banker dreams of, as he can operate from anywhere in the world. I'll take the entrepreneur route any day of the week. Zero to one states that the first step to starting a business is betting on a contrarian truth. This is the basis for most successful businesses. Time: 11:51 - 12:11 For example, Netflix had to bet on the fact that people wanted to binge watch TV shows at home, and Airbnb had to believe that people would be willing to stay in a stranger's house. For many people, the biggest hurdle is coming up with an idea. However, this is often easier than you might think. Disrupt You outlines an effective method, which is to write down three things that annoy you every day and think about how they could be done better. By doing this, you'll have 90 ideas to consider each month. When you have an idea, don't be afraid to share it with people that can help you. People tend to be too protective of their plans, but the truth is that an idea alone is usually not that great. The lean start up emphasizes the importance of execution Time: 12:12 - 12:54 and the use of the build, measure, learn feedback loop. This approach ensures that you don't create something nobody wants and allows you to pivot and adapt your idea as you go. There was an interesting study conducted on 108 new businesses across 30 industries. Time: 12:54 - 13:09 Out of these, Time: 13:10 - 13:11 92 businesses chose to enter red oceans, while 16 Time: 13:11 - 13:15 adopted a blue ocean strategy. A blue ocean refers to a market that has little to no competition, Time: 13:16 - 13:21 while a red ocean is named so because of the fierce competitions between competitors. The study found that 39% Time: 13:22 - 13:29 of profits came from businesses in competitive markets, Time: 13:29 - 13:32 while 61% Time: 13:32 - 13:34 of profits came from those that used the blue ocean strategy. Time: 13:34 - 13:37 Furthermore, these businesses went on to dominate their industries for ten to fifteen years after launch. A good strategy for creating your own blue ocean is to become oversubscribed. Time: 13:38 - 13:48 Consider Ferraris. Time: 13:48 - 13:49 Many people want them, but not everyone can have one. Yet, the people that run Ferrari aren't losing sleep over this, as they know that this scarcity keeps demand high and the cars highly desired. Every oversubscribed product has people who are willing to buy it, but can't get their hands on it. When I'm driving up demand for my products, I always remember the core lesson from breakthrough advertising. Time: 13:50 - 14:11 This book is actually the most expensive book in the video. It states that you can't manufacture Time: 14:12 - 14:17 desires. Time: 14:17 - 14:18 Instead, your job is to create a product that fulfills the market's already existing desires. Time: 14:18 - 14:23 Level three, 1,000,000 Time: 14:24 - 14:26 to $10,000,000 Time: 14:26 - 14:27 plus. Elon Musk wouldn't be nearly as successful as he is today if he didn't have the ability to inspire others to make his visions a reality. Influence, The Psychology of Persuasion Time: 14:27 - 14:37 is one of the best books on this topic. I've been using this principle in my model shops for years, as my employees are encouraged to help customers with quick repairs for free. I know that if we do this, the person's far more likely to come back in the future and make a much larger purchase. Time: 14:38 - 14:53 You can use this with anything. Just focus on giving value, and eventually, it'll come back to you. Dealing with people comes with a lot of headaches. Time: 14:53 - 15:01 You can't compromise on your vision, but you also need to make sure that people don't resent you. Never split the difference says you can do this by using something called tactical empathy. The key is to empathize with someone's situation to get them to empathize with yours. People want to be heard. And as mentioned in How to Win Friends and Influence People, they don't wanna be told they're wrong. The reality is all humans are emotion led creatures. They tend to make their decisions with this in mind and then justify their actions with logic. Pitch anything explains this as having three different brains, the croc brain, which developed when we were mere animals, the midbrain, and the neocortex, Time: 15:01 - 15:38 where we make all of our decisions. Most people try to appeal to the neocortex when they want to sell something, but first, you need to break through the crop brain. You can do this by using emotion and making what you're asking for as simple as possible. Leadership is something I've spent a lot of time learning about because the better you are at it, the more money you can make. Start with why shares a useful tool called the golden circle, where why is at the center, how is in the middle ring, and what is in the outer ring. Bad leaders start from the out outside and rarely get to the center. This is like my teachers at school who told me to read because that's what I needed to do, but never inspired me to take action. On the other hand, my mentors told me that if I wanted to become wealthy and have freedom, Time: 15:39 - 16:23 I should read specific books, and they gave me recommendations Time: 16:24 - 16:27 to achieve my goals. After that, I really saw the value in books. The key here is that great leaders inspire you to take action. Time: 16:27 - 16:35 They don't tell you to. It may surprise you, but all leaders are pretty calculated people deep down. Reading the 48 laws of power opened my eyes to this even more. One of my favorite laws was number 11, learn to keep people dependent on you. This is so true as an employee and a leader. If you can be replaced by someone, you can never truly have power. However, if your future business is dependent on irreplaceable people, it will eventually collapse. Time: 16:36 - 17:03 The reason why 80% of new businesses fail is that the person running it does not understand how to build systems and processes. The e myth outlines how most people who start businesses are not entrepreneurs, Time: 17:03 - 17:15 but rather just good at a certain skill. For example, someone who makes good cakes may not necessarily be able to run a successful bakery. These kinds of entrepreneurs Time: 17:15 - 17:25 often overinvest in their businesses, Time: 17:25 - 17:27 hoping that one day they will turn a profit. However, what often happens is the income slows down while expenses remain high, leading to the closure of the business and no profits. That's why adopting the strategy described in the book Profit First is crucial. The book proposes that entrepreneurs should run their business with the calculation Time: 17:27 - 17:47 sales minus profit equals expenses Time: 17:47 - 17:50 to ensure that they're always profitable. I believe one of the primary reasons I've succeeded in business for so long is by specializing Time: 17:50 - 17:57 in one specific niche, Time: 17:57 - 17:59 radio controlled models. Although it may seem small, I know I could be the best in my field. Good to Great describes this as having a hedgehog mentality. Time: 17:59 - 18:08 Each day, the fox attempts Time: 18:08 - 18:10 new tactics to Time: 18:11 - 18:12 catch the hedgehog, but every time, the hedgehog rolls into a ball, using this tried and tested strategy to avoid being eaten. Being extremely good in one area makes you rich in the long run. Up until this point, I haven't discussed world events as they relate to the bigger picture. Time: 18:13 - 18:27 This is because I believe that you need not worry about them until you have the power to influence them. If you have a considerable amount of wealth, it may be worth reading the fourth turning, Time: 18:28 - 18:38 which suggests that every century consists of around four twenty five year historical blocks called the high, Time: 18:38 - 18:44 awakening, Time: 18:45 - 18:45 unraveling, and crisis. Another good one is the changing world order, which discusses the idea that every major superpower Time: 18:46 - 18:54 has its time and eventually Time: 18:54 - 18:56 declines. These can provide a perspective on how events and trends may impact the economy and society, Time: 18:56 - 19:02 which can be useful for making informed decisions about investments and business ventures, but aren't necessarily something to worry about if you haven't made at least 10,000,000, in my opinion. I'm gonna leave the next video right up there, but don't click on it just yet. Make sure to subscribe if you wanna grow your wealth. Okay? I'll see you over there. Time: 19:02 - 19:212 things that helped me and literally changed my life 1. I stopped watching porn 2. I read the book called 'Money Hidden Magic' 3. Stop drinking",

      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:08 and 18 so you can get financially ahead. And if you're older, then use this as a checklist to make sure you're on track. I promise, if you just implement a few of these things, you'll be so far ahead of everyone else, they won't even believe you. I managed to become a millionaire in my twenties. However, if I watched a video like this when I was younger, then I'm sure I could've made my first million much faster. Don't just watch the part of the video that's for your age. You need to do all of these things. And if you skip steps, Time: 00:08 - 00:37 you might end up regretting it. Right. Let's kick this off with age 13. Time: 00:37 - 00:41 When it comes to investing, the hands down most important thing is time in the market. Time: 00:44 - 00:49 But what does that actually mean? Well, put simply, you wanna have your money invested for as long as possible so it can start growing rapidly, Time: 00:50 - 00:58 like a snowball rolling down a hill and eventually turning into an avalanche. So if you're actually 13 or younger and you're watching this video right now, I think all us oldies would agree that you're in the best possible position. So how do you actually start investing at this age? Well, as you're currently not of legal age to invest on your own, you're gonna need to convince a parent or guardian to open up something called a custodial account. Now I understand it might be hard to speak to your parents about money and investing. My parents never ever spoke about money at all, let alone investing. Time: 00:58 - 01:33 So if you want to, feel free to show them the next thirty seconds of this video so I can help persuade them to open up one for you. A custodial account is an investing account controlled by an adult for the benefit of a minor, typically a family member. These have different names depending on where you live. In The UK, we have something called a junior stocks and shares ISA, which lets your parent or guardian invest up to £9,000 Time: 01:33 - 01:58 a year on your behalf. Now, of course, they don't have to do this much, but just think, every birthday or Christmas, you could ask them to put some money into the account and invest in some stocks and shares. I'm not a financial advisor, and this shouldn't be taken as financial advice. However, over the years, I've just invested in a simple low cost S and P five hundred index fund. This invests your money across just over 500 of the biggest public companies in The USA, so you don't have to worry about picking individual stocks. Time: 01:58 - 02:28 The historical average yearly return of the s and p five hundred is 12.58% Time: 02:28 - 02:34 over the last ten years as of the May Time: 02:34 - 02:37 2024. Time: 02:37 - 02:38 Of course, investments can go down as well as up. If you've got a junior stocks and shares ISA, then you'll be able to start managing it for yourself from the age of 16, Time: 02:38 - 02:47 and you could start to withdraw money from the age of 18 if you wanted to. But if you're anything like me, once you've got the investing bug, you'll probably wanna keep it growing. In America, you have two main options, a UGMA Time: 02:48 - 03:00 and a UTMA. Time: 03:01 - 03:02 These both have unlimited Time: 03:02 - 03:03 contributions, Time: 03:04 - 03:04 but you could trigger gift tax if your parent or guardian puts in more than $18,000 Time: 03:05 - 03:10 in one year. The only real difference between these two is that with a UTMA, Time: 03:10 - 03:14 you can also invest in real estate and fine art. A custodial account can be set up with most banks and brokerages. Time: 03:15 - 03:21 My favorite is Vanguard for both The UK and The USA as they have pretty low fees, and they've certainly been around for a long time. So if you're younger than 18, then please, please, please Time: 03:22 - 03:32 promise me you talk to your parents about getting one of these accounts as it gives you such a head start. Right. Moving on to age 14. Time: 03:32 - 03:40 Besides time, another huge advantage you have at this age is that you probably don't have to pay rent and other monthly bills. Time: 03:42 - 03:49 This means you have the freedom to try different ways to make money since you don't need a reliable income every single month. You should go out and try everything from cleaning driveways with pressure washers to competitive sports. Time: 03:49 - 04:01 Not everything has to be about making money. You can learn a lot from other activities, which you can use to make money when you're older. My son Curtis used to get up at 4AM most mornings for swimming practice. Time: 04:02 - 04:14 Of course, he didn't earn any money from this, but it did teach him discipline. Time: 04:14 - 04:18 So when he started his business at 18, he could outwork his competition. I speak to so many teenagers who tell me they don't have a talent. Time: 04:19 - 04:27 But when I ask them what their hobbies are, they can't even name a few they've tried. You can't expect to find your talent if you don't try a wide range of different things. If it doesn't work out, then that's absolutely fine. Just try the next thing and the next. Time: 04:27 - 04:41 When you find something you're naturally good at or enjoy getting better at, double down on it and make it your mission to become one of the best. Next, Time: 04:42 - 04:50 age 15. Time: 04:51 - 04:52 One of the things I miss most about being younger is birthday and Christmas presents. Not that I got a lot as my parents weren't very wealthy, but I definitely got more than I do now. That's just the reality of growing up, especially for young men. So instead of asking for presents like Time: 04:53 - 05:09 PS four games and other things that you're not really gonna care about in less than a few months, a huge life hack is to ask for cash whenever possible. I'd also highly recommend going and getting a Saturday job. Now don't be too picky at this stage. Time: 05:09 - 05:24 Even working in a retail store behind a counter can earn you a nice bit of extra money. You'll also learn a lot of useful social skills that that will prepare you for the real world. Doing both of these things will help you start stashing away cash as long as you avoid the temptation to spend it. I like to use the word stash instead of save as I have a problem with the way most teenagers approach saving money. They will save for months and then go and spend it all on a new game console or a day at the theme park. Now, obviously, we all like a roller coaster. That's for sure. This shouldn't be what you're stashing your cash for, though. Of course, you should spend some of it to have fun. However, see your stash more like a launchpad Time: 05:24 - 06:04 that you can use to make even more money. The hardest thing in the world is starting with $0 to your name. So if you can avoid that, Time: 06:04 - 06:13 even if you have as little as a hundred dollars, then it's gonna make everything Time: 06:13 - 06:17 so much easier. Oh, and I almost forgot. Go and apply for your provisional driving license. In The UK, you can do this when you're fifteen years and nine months old, so it's worth getting even if you don't intend to start using it right away. Right. Now it's getting serious. Age 16. Time: 06:18 - 06:33 You've got a two year window before you enter the real world, so it's time to really think about what skills you're gonna start focusing on and developing. By now, if you've done all the things I've mentioned in this video, then you should have a pretty solid idea of what you're good at. These may seem unrelated at first, but pick a handful of them and start stacking your skills on top of each other. When I was younger, I was talented at selling, designing mechanics, and woodwork, so I invested my money into different things that would help me get better at those skills. Now I had no idea how I'd link them together, but I trusted that in the end, it would all make sense. I'm not really talking about buying courses as there's so many fake gurus out there just trying to scam you out for your money. With that said, there are some good ones around as well. Time: 06:35 - 07:21 Even better though, if you can find some sort of community to join where you can chat and learn, so much the better. However, the majority of your money should be invested in equipment. I remember when my son bought his first iMac for $500 Time: 07:21 - 07:34 from his uncle. He did this with the money he'd saved from doing part time jobs. Because that was the biggest purchase he'd ever made at the time, he would sit at that Mac and learn everything about it. This led to him teaching himself how to edit videos and use Photoshop. Time: 07:34 - 07:49 Investing in tools like this can really open so many doors. Between now and '18, your biggest aim should be to develop these different skills that you can later use to make more money than someone that just decided to play video games. This is because you can come into the real world with some actual value to offer. This heavily cuts down the amount of training a company needs to give you, which takes the burden off them. Onto age 17. Time: 07:50 - 08:14 Now listen to me very carefully. Time: 08:16 - 08:18 You need to pass your driving test. Yes, I know you probably don't need to drive anywhere at 17, but trust me, the sooner you do this, the better. In some states in The USA, you can do this as early as 16. Time: 08:18 - 08:31 Remember, you only need to do it once. Not being able to drive is one of the biggest things stopping most people from starting a side hustle. I mean, what if you have the chance to work with a client, but they live thirty minutes away, and you can't get a lift every week? You'd have to rely on public transport, Time: 08:31 - 08:47 and we all know how unreliable that is. You'll probably end up getting a bad name for yourself and coming across as unprofessional, Time: 08:47 - 08:54 leading to that opportunity going out the window. One of my key rules to this day is to be early is to be on time. To be on time is to be late, and to be late, well, that is unacceptable. So if you're watching this now and considering driving lessons, do it. Please don't be that person that regrets not jumping on it sooner. Time: 08:54 - 09:14 Yes. It might be a bit scary at first. I thought it was really exciting, to be honest, but think about the bigger picture. Once you've learned, you can use some of that money you've been stashing away to buy yourself a cheap starter car, then nothing's holding you back. Now it's time for the big one, Time: 09:14 - 09:30 age 18. Time: 09:30 - 09:31 The world really opens up to you once you turn 18. Now you're officially classed as an adult, and there are so many things you can do to get financially ahead. I wish someone had sat me down on my eighteenth birthday and told me exactly what I needed to do. So that's what I'm gonna do for you now. I've made a checklist of seven things you need to do to set yourself up for success. Time: 09:33 - 09:54 Even if you're over the age of 18, it's super important you do all of these things sooner rather than later. Let me know in the comments how many you've ticked off. Number one, open your own bank accounts. Having your own bank accounts that only you have access to is the first logical step you should take once you're over the age of 18. I say accounts because, Time: 09:55 - 10:15 really and truly, you should have two. Time: 10:15 - 10:17 The first is a current account, or as the Americans call it, a checking account. Time: 10:18 - 10:22 This is where your money should flow in and out. For example, Time: 10:22 - 10:26 let's say you got yourself a job at a coffee shop. The coffee shop pays your wage into your current account, and then you can use that money on whatever you want, really. The second is a high interest savings account. Time: 10:26 - 10:38 This is where you should start building up an emergency fund of three to six months of your living expenses, Time: 10:38 - 10:43 just in case something out of your control happens and your income dries up. It's like when you chug a big pot shield potion on Fortnite, but keep some minis handy. So where should you open up these accounts? Time: 10:43 - 10:55 Well, you need to be looking for banks that don't charge high fees. I remember I used to get charged for stupid little things all the time. Having these accounts shouldn't cost you money. I also think you should have two accounts with different banks as it makes your savings way less easy to spend. When it's out of sight, it's out of mind. If you're in The UK, then I'd recommend going with a challenger bank like Monzo for your current account. Now this isn't sponsored, but their app is genuinely very good. Time: 10:56 - 11:24 For your savings account, Chase is a great option as they're currently offering 4.1% Time: 11:24 - 11:29 interest on your money, so you'll get paid for just leaving your money in the account. In The USA, I'd recommend looking at Ally Bank or Bank of America because they offer minimal fees and have really strong online banking service. Number two, get a credit card. When I was younger, I believed that if you never borrowed, you'd have an amazing credit score since you never took out a loan or made any late payments. It makes sense. Right? Well, Time: 11:29 - 11:54 that couldn't be further from the truth. Taking out a credit card when you turn 18 is the perfect tool to build up your credit score. You can do this by using your credit card to pay for the things you would normally pay for in cash, like paying for the gas in your car, for example, and then paying the card off in full every month without fail. Time: 11:55 - 12:14 Using it this way will ensure that you never get charged any interest at the same time as building up your credit score. A credit score is kinda like your Uber rating, but for money. Time: 12:14 - 12:25 Banks look at this, and then they decide whether or not they're gonna give you a loan, and if they do, what interest rate they're gonna charge you. Now lots of people are against the idea of getting a credit card because they're taught from a really young age that debt is bad. I know this because Time: 12:25 - 12:40 that's exactly what I was taught. My dad would always say, never a lender or a borrower be. This was a saying that originally came from rich people years and years ago to keep the workers down, As they knew, by borrowing, the working class could create wealth for themselves. Time: 12:40 - 12:57 The rich wanted to keep getting richer and keep the poor in their place. If I had a credit card when I was 18, it would have been much easier to get a mortgage sooner and buy my first property. Time: 12:58 - 13:08 I would have also been able to borrow more money at lower interest rates. Now Time: 13:09 - 13:13 that may not sound significant, but over a long period, like a mortgage, this can really add up. Number three, open an investing account. The key is to open the correct type of account. Time: 13:14 - 13:25 You'll often hear people throwing around terms like Roth IRA in The USA, Time: 13:25 - 13:30 stocks and shares ISA in The UK, and TFSA in Canada, and supers in Australia. So if you don't have one of these accounts, then you're missing out as they allow you to avoid having to pay taxes on your investments, but they do have limits because Time: 13:30 - 13:45 they're extremely Time: 13:45 - 13:46 powerful. Nowadays, opening an investing account is very simple, but you can do it all from your mobile phone. The great thing about these investing apps is that it actually gives you the ability to buy fractional shares. So rather than having to pay $220 Time: 13:46 - 14:00 for an Apple share, you can invest as little as $1. Now I wish I had this option when I was younger, as it would have allowed me to get in some early experience with investing without having to take any big risks. One of my favorite investing platforms is Trading two one two, as they offer fractional shares and also stocks and shares ISAs. Time: 14:00 - 14:19 Since I was planning to talk about their app anyway, I reached out to them to see if they'd be interested in sponsoring this portion of the video. They agreed and are offering a free stock worth up to a hundred pound to anyone that uses the code Tilbury when they create an account. Plus, you can get more free stocks by inviting your friends. Both of you will get a free share as long as they fund their account. If you aren't quite ready to invest for real, one of the really cool things about trading two one two is they let you practice investing with fake money. You can get familiar with the markets using real data without risking any actual money. So if you're a little uncomfortable with investing or just wanna try out some strategies before putting your own money on the line, this is a great way to get started. Time: 14:19 - 15:02 Also, don't worry if you've already opened an account within the last ten days. You can still use a promo code tilbury in the app and receive your free share. So feel free to pause the video right now, get your free stock, and then continue watching. Number four, carefully consider university. Time: 15:02 - 15:18 So many teenagers have asked me, is going to university a scam? My answer is always yes Time: 15:18 - 15:24 and no. On one hand, for some careers, you certainly need to go to university like doctors, Time: 15:25 - 15:30 nurses, and teachers. There is a direct result from doing university courses like this. You get a degree, and the career path opens up to you. These professions play critical roles in our society, directly impacting the way we function, Time: 15:31 - 15:44 so are absolutely not a scam. I actually think these types of courses should be free and reserved for the people with the best grades and passion for following one of these careers. However, on the other hand, there are a lot of other courses out there that don't open up job opportunities directly. And therefore, Time: 15:45 - 16:02 why waste your money, and more importantly, your time Time: 16:02 - 16:05 studying at university for something you don't really need? Skill trades like plumbing, entrepreneurship, Time: 16:06 - 16:11 and tech, well, they don't require a degree. It's more about how good you are at what you do. Your track record and results will speak for itself. I mean, I read through my comments on here, and I've seen lots of people claim they've learned more from me than they did in their business degree. Now that really says a lot. For me and for a lot of other employers, it's more about your practical experience and attitude than anything else. So please don't be pressured into going to university to study something you don't care about and waste four years of your life. I mean, I heard there's a golf management degree now. How ridiculous. Time: 16:12 - 16:49 Personally, I love golf. I just won a major competition called the Duke of Edinburgh Cup. I didn't need to go to university to learn how to play or manage the game. It's laughable. It really is. Look. If you really don't know what to do with your life, my advice would be to get an apprenticeship. Time: 16:50 - 17:05 They were huge back in my day, and they're coming back and getting more popular than ever. Plus, you get paid for your learning. It's a win win situation if you ask me. So while those schools and maybe your mates will try and push you to go to university, Time: 17:05 - 17:19 think about what you really want. Think about the 60 to a hundred k debt that you could have wrapped around your neck and ask yourself, Time: 17:19 - 17:27 is it worth paying that off for the whole of your life? Number five, avoid bad debt. Debt is like a heavy anchor that drags you down, slowing your progress and holding you back from reaching your full potential. Don't get me wrong. In some cases, you can use debt to your advantage, like when buying a property, for example. Time: 17:27 - 17:46 Taking on a mortgage to buy real estate can be a really smart investment because property can go up in value as time goes by. By using this debt strategically, Time: 17:47 - 17:55 you can leverage this borrowed money to have access to these assets that will hopefully increase your long term net worth. The same goes for having your own business. If you borrow money to start your own business and it takes off, you can make some serious profit. Without that initial money, you might never be successful. I know that was the case for me when I opened up my first radio control model shop. Without a loan, I simply couldn't have started. However, there is a type of debt you should avoid at all costs, and this is consumer Time: 17:56 - 18:26 debt. If you can't afford to buy something outright that isn't going to create wealth, then you shouldn't buy it. A lot of people finance their cars, and this is just one example of where borrowing money actually leaves you worse off in the long run. Here in The UK, a shocking 2,200,000 Time: 18:26 - 18:44 drivers finance their cars, and I'm willing to bet Time: 18:44 - 18:46 most of them are stuck in this money trap. I understand that you might wanna drive a certain car. Now I love cars, so I totally understand that. I get it. But is it really worth it? Just something for you to think about. Number six, Time: 18:47 - 19:01 start a side hustle. Most people's advice when you turn 18 is go and get a job. They make it sound so miserable, and it's like you get no choice with your life. That's what you're expected to do. Go to your job and be miserable. Well, let me tell you, it doesn't have to be this way. You don't have to wake up every morning thinking that you're stuck and not progressing. If you follow this video so far, you'll have some valuable skills, and you can use them to start a service based side hustle. Time: 19:01 - 19:29 This type of side hustle is great. Think copywriting, Time: 19:29 - 19:32 video editing, videography, Time: 19:33 - 19:34 web development, and community management. Time: 19:35 - 19:37 All of these require very little start up money. You just need to master the skill inside and out. If you haven't got a high income skill yet, then you really need to catch up. So no matter what job you go and get, leverage it. Use the skills it gives you and the money you make to transform your daily grind into a launchpad for greater things. Even if you can't learn any skills from it, use it as motivation to put in the extra work on the weekend to learn a valuable skill and improve your current situation. Time: 19:38 - 20:06 Start viewing it like this. Time: 20:07 - 20:09 Every shift you dread is the investment towards your future. Number seven, invest for the long term. Compound interest is an extremely powerful law, especially when it comes to investing. It means that not only will you earn interest on your initial investment, but you also earn interest Time: 20:09 - 20:27 on the interest that you've already earned. This can lead to your money growing bigger and bigger over time. It's like when you create that snowball and roll it down the hill. It just keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger the more snow that's packed onto it. For example, let's say you invest $250 Time: 20:28 - 20:44 a month at age 18 into a Roth IRA or a stocks and shares ISA. Time: 20:44 - 20:49 Assuming an average yearly return of 8% by the age of 65, Time: 20:50 - 20:54 your investment could grow to approximately $1,500,000 Time: 20:54 - 20:58 tax free. Now if we compare this to someone who starts investing the same amount at age 28, Time: 20:58 - 21:04 by the age he's 65, Time: 21:05 - 21:06 their investment would only reach around $679,000 Time: 21:07 - 21:11 under the same conditions. Time: 21:11 - 21:13 That's less than half the amount. Time: 21:13 - 21:15 See, those extra ten years of compounding Time: 21:16 - 21:18 really boost the final amount because there's more time for interest to build on interest. So the younger you start, the better. Not only will you have time on your side, but you'll also typically earn less at a younger age, placing you in a lower tax bracket. Time: 21:18 - 21:33 This means you'll keep more of your earnings because you won't be taxed as heavily compared to when you earn more later in life. If you wanna dive deeper into how to pick the best stocks, then watch this video next, but don't click on it just yet. Make sure to subscribe if you wanna grow your wealth. Okay? I'll see you over there. Time: 21:34 - 21:50Everyone family has that one person who will break the family financial struggle I hope you become the one 😏",

      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:02 And if I could go back to talk to my 20 year old self and give him some advice, Time: 00:02 - 00:06 here are the 50 things I would say. Number one, work on your willpower. You'll never reach your full potential or outwork your rivals if you can't focus for long periods of time. This was true when I was younger, but it's even more applicable now with so many distractions fighting for your attention. Time: 00:06 - 00:24 If you can focus and work hard, you'll be miles ahead of everyone else. So why not use this video as a test for yourself? If you can reach the end without skipping and actually listen to everything I say on a deep level, then you'll be in the minority. Number two, become more of a producer than a consumer. I understand consuming content is key, especially if you learn a lot. However, you should always be trying to put more out into the world than you're taking. Otherwise, you'll end up robbed of your time and attention. Number three, be nice to people on the come up because you never know where they're gonna be in the future. There have been countless times when I've underestimated Time: 00:25 - 01:01 someone's potential only to see them achieve incredible success later on. By treating everyone with kindness and support, even if you're unsure about their plans, you create good karma. Time: 01:02 - 01:13 If they strike it big, they'll likely remember those who were in their corner, and you may benefit from that connection too. Number four, watch what most people are doing and then do the opposite. It took me a few years to find the courage to leave my nine to five job and start my own business. Time: 01:13 - 01:28 I was comfortable with the routine of receiving a paycheck and accepting life as it was. However, when I built a staircase for a wealthy entrepreneur, Time: 01:28 - 01:36 I realized there was another path available. Time: 01:37 - 01:39 I'm grateful I took that chance. I mean, I wouldn't be a millionaire now if I continued working for someone else. This is a pretty simple idea because if you do what everyone else does, then you're gonna get the same results. So reject the idea of being normal and vanilla. As the saying goes, if you're everyone's cup of tea, then you're a mug. Number five, who you know matters a thousand times more than what you know. A great network beats money in the bank every time. I can't count how many times my connections have helped me out. Number six, never talk behind someone's back. If you have a problem with someone, you should address it with them directly or not at all. You may think that gossiping about people when they can't hear you makes you seem cool, but it actually makes you seem less trustworthy Time: 01:40 - 02:23 to those who are listening Time: 02:24 - 02:25 as they'll think you're doing the same behind their backs. Number seven, give yourself permission to make more mistakes. Most of my success has come from my failures. I wish I knew this sooner. I mean, I enjoy skiing with my son, and I remember one year, we competed to see who could fall the least. I won as Curtis fell over a lot. However, he improved tremendously, and now he's a much faster skier than me. This just proves that failure leads to improvement if it's embraced. So remember, if you never fail, then you're probably not trying hard enough. Number eight, make reversible decisions quickly. I actually picked this one up from Jeff Bezos as he said, with a decision that you can go back on, your biggest risk is dragging your feet and not making a decision. However, when decisions are irreversible, Time: 02:25 - 03:12 slow them down as the biggest risk here is making the wrong decision. So it's worth getting as much information as possible before taking action. Number nine, focus on one thing at a time. The truth is there is no such thing as multitasking, Time: 03:13 - 03:27 just Time: 03:28 - 03:28 multifaling. Time: 03:28 - 03:29 So give yourself time to focus on one thing deeply without distractions. Time: 03:30 - 03:34 Trust me, you'll achieve far more. Number 10, Time: 03:34 - 03:37 don't be the best. Be the only. You can do this by learning seemingly unrelated skills and combining them together. Time: 03:38 - 03:45 Steve Jobs is well known for mixing his love for calligraphy and design with technology Time: 03:45 - 03:50 and creating Apple as we know it today. He was the only person doing that at the time. This is one of my golden pieces of advice, and after every 10 bits of advice, I'm gonna drop another one of these. Number 11. If you don't like something, then change it. If you can't change it, then change your attitude. Never complain. I used to be a bit of a complainer. But as I've gone through life, I've realized that 80% of the time, no one cares about your problems, and 20% of them wish they had them in the first place. Even if your whole world is crumbling, Time: 03:50 - 04:20 complaining might do anything positive for you. I'm not saying you can't express your feelings. However, it's important to remember, we all have our own problems, and not many people care about fixing yours. Number 12, work smart, not hard. As I've grown old and gray, I've seen the birth of lots of revolutionary Time: 04:21 - 04:38 technology like color TVs, the iPhone, and artificial intelligence. Time: 04:38 - 04:42 The crazy thing is a lot of my generation aren't like me and choose to reject it, which makes working smart very difficult. But for you tech savvy youngsters, Time: 04:42 - 04:51 working smart and building a business has never been easier. I mean, take a look at this for example. One of the hottest businesses at the moment is ecommerce Time: 04:51 - 04:59 as it's infinitely scalable and provides geographical freedom. But building a website requires either a unique skill set or money to pay somebody else to do it for you. But with Build Your Store AI, you can get a fully custom Shopify store built completely for free in less than two minutes. Here's one I made earlier. As you can see, all I had to do was select the niche of my store, pick some images that work, and then let AI take care of the rest. The website even comes with winning products and ready pages, Time: 05:00 - 05:29 like policies and returns. Time: 05:30 - 05:31 Of course, this is all fully customizable, Time: 05:31 - 05:33 but it's a great starting point and perfectly sums up working smart and not hard. I'll leave a link in the description below if you're interested in selling products online and having a free website built for you. The link also gives you access to a special Shopify trial for $1 so you can launch your business risk free. Number 13, assume you can learn something from everyone you meet. I'm not afraid to admit that in my twenties, Time: 05:34 - 05:58 I was a little bit arrogant. I thought I knew everything, but looking back, I now realize how much more I still had to learn. Time: 05:58 - 06:05 I'm very aware that in ten years' time, I'll look back at what I currently know and probably think the same. Even at 57, I'm still learning new things every day. Time: 06:05 - 06:15 So if I were you, I'd just skip the arrogant stage and be open to learning new things even from those younger than you. Number 14, never disrespect your elders. I know on the surface, we might seem boring, but us older people have been through a lot. Time: 06:15 - 06:29 Our experience can probably help you avoid many mistakes if you take the time to listen. However, if you disagree with something I say, you don't have to follow my advice. Time: 06:30 - 06:39 All I ask is that you listen with an open mind and then make your own decisions. Number 15, don't be afraid of change. Embrace it. I started a chain of radio controlled model shops in my twenties, and the goal was to expand all over the world. However, when the Internet was created, that all changed. Suddenly, more and more people were shopping online, and my shops were suffering. I could have just given up. However, instead, I embraced the change and started the ecommerce side of my business and started making more than ever before. There's a famous quote that sums this up quite well, and it goes like this. Once a new technology Time: 06:39 - 07:14 rolls over you, if you're not part of the steamroller, Time: 07:14 - 07:16 you're part of the road. Number 16, Time: 07:17 - 07:19 live in the moment, not on your phone. Make the most of every moment. You don't need to capture everything for social media. Focus on what's happening right in front of you, especially when it's something you might never experience again. I didn't realize how many last times I went through without knowing it. Whether it's hanging out with your friends that weekly bowling night or a yearly tradition, Time: 07:19 - 07:41 one day, it will be the final time, and you probably won't even see it coming. Number 17, Time: 07:41 - 07:47 always pay the bill. This one's for the guys. Yeah. It might sound a bit old school, but it's part of being a gentleman. Time: 07:47 - 07:53 Paying the bill is just a small gesture that shows you care. And, no, it's not simping unless you're always doing it and getting nothing back. Number 18, say no if you genuinely aren't ready. It's okay to admit when you need more time or aren't quite prepared to take something on. Sure. People love to say fake it till you make it. But if you can't close that knowledge gap in time, it's smarter to turn it down rather than risk being in over your head. Number 19, present yourself in the way you wish to be perceived. It's important to think about how you want to come across to others, and then make a conscious effort to present yourself in that way. This includes how you dress, how you speak, what you post on social media, and even how you carry yourself. Time: 07:53 - 08:37 Think of it like building your own video game character from the ground up. Number 20, Time: 08:37 - 08:42 mentally prepare yourself for your loved ones dying. I know this isn't the nicest thing to talk about, but you do need to think about it. When something like this happens, it can send shock waves throughout our lives. And if you aren't ready to withstand this, then you'll just crumble. Time: 08:42 - 08:57 Thinking this way also helps you to value every moment you spend with your loved ones as nothing is forever. Number 21, Time: 08:58 - 09:05 never take rejection personally. Whether it's a job interview or something else, try to see things from their point of view. Use the feedback to improve the next time. Taking rejection personally just holds you back from growing and getting better. Number 22, Time: 09:05 - 09:19 don't be embarrassed to take a nap now and again. I know this one may sound silly, but when I was younger, I thought naps were for kids and old people. But I've met so many millionaires that swear by having short power naps throughout the day. So don't be ashamed or embarrassed about taking a nap as it can actually help you be more productive in the long run. Number 23, Time: 09:19 - 09:40 learn from those who disagree with you. Too many people are trapped in a bubble on social media, and they can't face their beliefs being challenged. Remember, you can learn something from everyone. So just because you don't agree on a couple of things, it doesn't mean you shouldn't listen to their opinions. Number 24, Time: 09:40 - 09:57 never be late. Punctuality is a sign of respect for other people's time and shows that you're reliable and trustworthy. Time: 09:57 - 10:04 Early is on time, on time is late, and late is unforgivable. Time: 10:05 - 10:09 Number 25, Time: 10:09 - 10:11 be motivated by something greater than money. This comes from your values. Having strong values means that no one can buy you no matter how much they offer. Time: 10:11 - 10:19 These values are principles you refuse to compromise under any circumstances. Time: 10:20 - 10:24 One of mine is prioritizing my family. If something isn't in their best interest, then I won't do it under any circumstances. Time: 10:24 - 10:31 So figure out what you're passionate about and make a stand. This will allow you to command more respect from others. Number 26, be fueled by vision, not fear. Fearful people worry about losing what they have and can never see far enough ahead to build something for the future. Number 27, Time: 10:32 - 10:49 stand up to bullies. I stayed stuck in a job way too long, letting my manager push me around before I finally quit and started my own business. Trust me. You can't let anyone, whether it's a man or a woman, bully you. Most of the time, if you stand up for yourself once, that's all it takes. Bullies can seriously mess with your confidence, and that's the last thing you need when you're young and trying to find your own way. Number 28, Time: 10:49 - 11:14 use your unfair advantages. Time: 11:14 - 11:15 Everyone has certain strengths or circumstances that can give them an edge, and it's important to identify and use them. An unfair advantage is something that sets you apart, whether it's a specific skill, a connection, or your life situation. It's not about cheating. It's about recognizing what you're naturally good at or the opportunities you have that others might not and using those to your advantage to get ahead. Number 29, skip the flashy car. It's a waste in your twenties. Buy used but reliable. I've seen so many young people coming to money quickly only to blow it on things like luxury cars and designer gear. Sure. It's easy to have short term success and splurge, but what's far more impressive is consistently building wealth over time. That's what true legends do. Number 30, prioritize your reputation. It's one of the few things that lives on after you die. I've had the unfortunate experience of attending many funerals in my time, and the person is always remembered for their character. In other words, their reputation, Time: 11:16 - 12:15 not their achievements. Time: 12:15 - 12:16 Number 31, don't compare yourself to your friends. We all have our own path to walk. As long as you're improving on what you've done before, then you're going in the right direction. Time: 12:17 - 12:25 If you do this for enough years, then you'll look back and be shocked at how far you've come. Time: 12:26 - 12:30 It's all about taking those baby steps and not getting distracted by what everyone else is doing. Number 32, Time: 12:31 - 12:38 don't let a bad day turn into a bad week. It takes less than five seconds for someone to ruin your day. And if you're not careful, that can spiral into a whole week of negativity. It's important to let it go so you don't miss out on all the good opportunities Time: 12:38 - 12:52 that that week still has to offer. Number 33, Time: 12:53 - 12:56 always pay off your credit card. I had to mention this one because it's so important. Time: 12:56 - 13:00 If you don't pay off your credit card in full each month, you're just wasting money and hurting your credit score. Be smart about it. Make paying it off a habit, and it'll stick with you for life. Number 34. Any job is better than no job. Being out of work can really take its toll on you mentally. So if the only position available is washing cars for $10 an hour, go for it. It's not just about the pay. It's about getting out there, interacting with others, and boosting your self esteem that comes from showing up for a job. Who knows? You might make some mates. I still have a friend I met during my car washing days forty seven years ago. Number 35, Time: 13:01 - 13:38 never buy an investment without doing your own research. I've seen so many people lose money on poor investments, and usually, it's because they didn't take the time to look into it. Make sure you do your homework. Even if you think you might miss out on something big, if someone is pressuring you to invest, that's often a red flag. Number 36, Time: 13:38 - 13:57 being a great storyteller can get you anything you want. Knowing how to tell a good story is such a game changer. Whether you're just hanging out with friends or trying to impress a future business partner, a great story grabs attention, makes your point stick, and helps you connect with people in a more real way. Plus, it's just a fun way to get your ideas across and leave an impression no matter the situation. Number 37, Time: 13:58 - 14:22 don't live your life for others. Don't let haters dictate your choices or make you shy away from doing what you truly want. If friends or family are pushing you into a career you're not passionate about, take a moment to think about your situation. Time: 14:22 - 14:35 You don't wanna end up in a job you despise for the rest of your life. Focus on building and living your dream life instead. Number 38, have a solid paycheck routine. Firstly, use 50% to pay for your needs. This is your food, rent, and electricity. Time: 14:35 - 14:51 Secondly, save 20% in a high interest savings account. This is your emergency fund. Thirdly, use 30% to pay off any high interest debt. This is your credit cards and car finance. Time: 14:51 - 15:03 Fourth, once you've paid off your debts, use 25% Time: 15:03 - 15:07 to invest in a Roth IRA or a stocks and shares ISA. This is to grow your wealth. Time: 15:07 - 15:13 Fifth, Time: 15:13 - 15:14 put 5% towards some risky plays like starting your own business. This is your chance to make some fast money. Number 39. Time: 15:14 - 15:22 It's not the end of the world if you don't have everything figured out. Everyone is winging it to some degree, and it took me over twenty years to realize this. Time: 15:22 - 15:30 Most people are just navigating life as best they can. I used to think I was at a disadvantage for not attending business school or even university. Time: 15:31 - 15:38 But as I've met more people over the years, I've learned that we're all just doing our best, learning and failing every day. You'll never reach the point where you know everything, so it's best to start as soon as you can and just figure it out as you go. Number 40, Time: 15:39 - 15:52 retirement might feel like it will never come, but it will. Start investing for it now. I know a lot of YouTubers are saying investing your money is not worth the time as you'll only get 8% per year. However, they aren't looking at the bigger picture. Of course, it's important to make money quickly, Time: 15:53 - 16:09 but it's equally as important to let some of it grow passively for your retirement. Number 41, the quality of your questions will shape your future success. I receive a lot of DMs. And while I try to respond to as many as possible, I often have to sift through them to find the valuable ones. I assume this is the same for most successful people. Time: 16:10 - 16:30 For instance, if your message starts with, hi. I know you're busy, but can I ask a question? You've already missed your chance. Another common one is, hi. Can we have a chat? That won't get you far either. Instead, take some time to think about your question and craft it thoughtfully. When you do that, you're much more likely to receive a meaningful answer. Remember, the quality of your question will directly impact the value of the response you get. Number 42, make sure to enjoy the journey, not just focus on the destination. There's a saying I've lived by. Happiness is a journey, not a destination. Time: 16:30 - 17:05 What that really means is that the ups and downs of a great journey stay with you forever, Time: 17:06 - 17:10 while the destination is just a brief moment that quickly fades away. Think about all those athletes you see getting interviewed after winning a gold medal or a big race. They're always asked, how does it feel? And almost everyone says, it hasn't sunk in yet. Time: 17:11 - 17:25 I think that's because they feel a bit of emptiness after reaching their goal. Sure. They've accomplished something amazing, but then it's like, what's next? Time: 17:26 - 17:34 So savor the ride and all the experiences along the way. Number 43, Time: 17:35 - 17:39 nothing is ever free. If you're not spending money, then you're spending time. From an early age, I always told my son that nothing in this world comes without a cost. If you want something, then you need to earn money to buy it. He would often argue with me about things he saw advertised as free, and I'd explain those offers often end up costing you the most. That's because if something isn't costing you money, it's likely costing you your time. Time: 17:39 - 18:04 You've probably heard the saying, time is money, and it couldn't be more accurate. Time: 18:04 - 18:08 When you're young, you tend to think you have all the time in the world, but you don't always value it enough. Don't waste it because before you know it, you'll be 57 reflecting on your twilight years to come. Number 44, stop waiting to be inspired and just get on with it. Inspiration can be pretty hard to come by sometimes, but sitting around waiting for that moment can really slow you down. Instead, just start taking some small steps towards what you want to do. You might be surprised once you dive in that motivation can kick in and make things flow. So don't overthink it. Just get going and see what happens. Number 45, Time: 18:09 - 18:46 work hard now for an easier life later. Take it easy now and face the consequences. Time: 18:46 - 18:51 Life often feels like it's turned upside down. When you're young, all you wanna do is party, travel, and have fun, but you usually lack the funds to do so. Time: 18:51 - 19:00 Then as you get older, your priorities shift towards wanting security, Time: 19:01 - 19:05 stability, Time: 19:05 - 19:05 and enough money to enjoy a comfortable retirement. You may eventually achieve that, but it often comes after years of hard work, pushing yourself until retirement at 67, Time: 19:06 - 19:16 and sometimes not living long enough to enjoy it fully. If you put in the effort in your twenties and resist the urge to follow the usual path, you can lay a solid financial foundation. This way, starting in your thirties, life can become a lot easier. I did just that, and it's been an amazing journey. Number 46, Time: 19:16 - 19:34 tackle the tough tasks in the morning. He says when he's filming at 5PM. Time: 19:34 - 19:39 Well, it's been a long day, but I enjoy it. I'm a big believer in making to do lists, but I used to approach them all wrong. I thought it was about checking off as many items as possible, which often meant I'd do all the easy tasks first. Time: 19:39 - 19:53 While this might have looked impressive, it left the harder jobs lingering. Years ago, I shifted my strategy to prioritize the difficult tasks first thing in the morning. Time: 19:54 - 20:04 This way, I knocked them out when I was most productive. Time: 20:04 - 20:07 And the best part is that once those two or three tough jobs are done, finishing off the easier ones in the afternoon becomes a breeze. Number 47, Time: 20:07 - 20:16 the name of a university Time: 20:16 - 20:17 means absolutely Time: 20:18 - 20:19 nothing. Seriously, don't stress over what uni you go to or rack up debt just for a fancy name. Time: 20:19 - 20:25 At the end of the day, it's what you learn and how you apply that really counts. Time: 20:25 - 20:29 Employers care more about skills and experience than the university you may or may not have attended. Number 48, Time: 20:30 - 20:36 look after your back. If you slouch, you'll have issues in your mid thirties. Sadly, this is advice that comes from firsthand experience. Time: 20:36 - 20:44 Your back is crucial. Over time, a bad back can severely impact your productivity since it makes it hard to get anything done. It's similar to having toothache, but unlike dental pain, there's no quick fix to relieve it. This generation benefits greatly from technology and the Internet, but it also faces issues from hunching over keyboards and lounging on comfortable sofas. Prioritize your back health. You'll need it for your entire life. You can replace your teeth, but you can't get a new back. Number 49, Time: 20:45 - 21:15 don't stress about being different. You don't have to fit in. Honestly, I never let the idea of being weird bother me. I embraced it. I was a tall skinny ginger haired dyslexic teenager Time: 21:15 - 21:26 who loved playing with model airplanes. Time: 21:26 - 21:28 Pretty unique. Right? When you accept what makes you different, you actually gain an advantage because you become comfortable with who you are while everyone else is busy trying to fit into molds that don't suit them. My dyslexia has become a superpower, Time: 21:29 - 21:42 allowing me to solve problems quickly. Time: 21:43 - 21:45 Being skinny keeps me relatively fit. My passion for model planes sparked my first business, and being tall helps me stand out and be remembered. Time: 21:45 - 21:54 As for the ginger hair, thank goodness that's gone. Number 50, choose your partner wisely. I wouldn't be a millionaire today without my supportive wife. A lot of people get caught up in dating lots of different options, but, honestly, Time: 21:54 - 22:08 what really counts is having a deep connection and being on the same path together. When you find someone you think you could marry, make sure you really want to spend your life with them. Too many people end up with regrets because they were blinded by that early puppy love. Time: 22:09 - 22:24 A solid partnership can make a huge difference, so take your time and choose someone who you can build a solid future with.

Make sure to subscribe if you wanna grow your wealth. Okay? I'll see you over there. Time: 22:35 - 22:43Hidden Time Wealth blew my mind.

      "transcript": "Time: 00:00 - 00:15 And a big part of that was down to avoiding the seven things I'm gonna be sharing with you today. The first thing to avoid is working for only money. Imagine for a moment that you got a boring but well paid job. You quickly start stacking some nice cash as your earnings grow. Your friends will think that you're absolutely killing it, and your parents would probably be pretty proud too. However, over time, your earning potential would start to plateau. Time: 00:16 - 00:41 This is path a. Now imagine instead you get a challenging but lower paid job. You might struggle for a couple of years as you improve and adapt. You may even struggle to pay the bills. Your friends will probably think you're falling behind, and your parents may not agree with the path you've taken. Time: 00:41 - 00:59 However, Time: 00:59 - 01:00 over time, your earning potential will start going through the roof. This is path b. So what's the difference between these two examples? Time: 01:00 - 01:09 Well, path a prioritizes money early on, whereas path Time: 01:10 - 01:14 b prioritizes Time: 01:15 - 01:15 two key things, Time: 01:16 - 01:17 skills and equity. Every self made millionaire I know has followed path b, as it's the only way to build that kind of wealth. As I mentioned, I left school at 16 with no qualifications. Time: 01:17 - 01:28 However, I immediately went out looking for jobs and actually got offered more than five opportunities. Time: 01:29 - 01:34 So I had a big decision to make. Which should I choose? Time: 01:35 - 01:38 I decided to become a carpenter's apprentice. The pay wasn't great, but I knew the skills I'd learned would be extremely valuable, so I prioritized those. Time: 01:39 - 01:48 There was no way I was gonna get equity in the business, but at least I was working for more than just money. That job taught me a lot. And although I was forced to quit after being relentlessly bullied by my manager, I still use many of those skills today when I'm designing my best selling brand of radio controlled planes that I sell across the world. By learning a wide range of high income skills, it makes it almost impossible for you to ever be broke again Time: 01:48 - 02:14 as you become your greatest asset. I like to think every job I had when I was younger added to my skill set, like a Swiss army knife. Nowadays, I'd recommend prioritizing Time: 02:14 - 02:24 online based high income skills, such as copywriting, video editing, and coding. The demand for these skills is only growing, and I can speak from experience that there is a huge skill shortage at the moment. Sure. There are lots of people doing those things. However, Time: 02:25 - 02:40 99% Time: 02:40 - 02:41 of them are just not up to standard. Honestly, Time: 02:41 - 02:44 your competition Time: 02:44 - 02:45 really isn't that tough. Now let's move on to the second thing, equity. Time: 02:45 - 02:50 This just means owning a percentage of a business so you can benefit from the profits. Time: 02:50 - 02:55 My radar control model brand is a perfect example of this. You can gain equity in a few different ways. The most obvious way and the way I did it was to start the business myself. However, you can also gain it by working for it if you're extremely skilled in certain areas. This is known as sweat equity. Time: 02:55 - 03:12 Lastly, you can purchase equity in certain businesses. Time: 03:13 - 03:16 Although, I wouldn't recommend this as much unless you have the skills that can help accelerate that business forward. My friend, Simon Squibb, often goes around in public telling people to start their own businesses Time: 03:16 - 03:28 or ask for equity from their boss. While I a % agree with the sentiment, you need to have some self awareness with this. Firstly, it's worthwhile working for someone to gain skills before starting a business of your own. Time: 03:28 - 03:41 Secondly, you need to be realistic. Time: 03:41 - 03:43 I didn't think for a moment that I'd get equity in the carpentry business when I was an apprentice. Time: 03:43 - 03:48 So when you ask, make sure you have a solid case for why you deserve it and how you can add value to the business instead of just taking from it. You need to first focus on becoming someone worthy of equity. The main takeaway here is that too many people get blinded by money, forget the importance of skills and equity. Time: 03:49 - 04:07 This is the biggest trap. The more you obsess over earning just money, the less you'll likely make in the long run. The second thing to avoid Time: 04:07 - 04:15 is buying a luxury lifestyle. Picture yourself cruising through Dubai's sun drenched streets in a bright yellow Lamborghini. Time: 04:15 - 04:22 You pull up to a swanky restaurant and order a $500 Time: 04:22 - 04:26 fillet steak without batting an eyelid. How does imagining that lifestyle make you feel? Pretty successful, right? Well, here's the truth. Time: 04:26 - 04:35 Most people you see living this way are far from successful. The majority are paying for cars they can't afford, taking trips to Dubai on credit cards they'll spend five months paying off and ordering steaks at Salt Bays restaurant that leave them with a bill they can't handle. These people are living a lie, pretending to be rich while drowning in debt. It's all smoke and mirrors, as it's much easier to impress others on social media than build real wealth. Seeing people live these luxury lifestyles might tempt you to start playing the flexing game too, as you feel like everyone is living a better life than you. However, this is far from the reality. In fact, 37% Time: 04:35 - 05:15 of Americans can't afford unexpected Time: 05:15 - 05:17 expenses over $400 Time: 05:17 - 05:19 30 9 percent worry they can't pay their bills, and 60% of American households can't afford to buy a new car. Once you've made your millions, you can buy whatever you want. That's the point of becoming wealthy. Time: 05:19 - 05:32 However, in the early days, you can't live like a king and build wealth at the same time. Time: 05:32 - 05:37 Instead of buying depreciating Time: 05:37 - 05:39 items like flashy cars, designer clothes, and dine in expensive restaurants, Time: 05:39 - 05:44 invest in assets such as stocks, shares, crypto, and real estate. These assets will increase in value and generate income that you can then use to do whatever you want. The third thing to avoid is doing everything yourself. You might be really great at what you do, but no matter how hard you try, you'll never be able to out compete a group of talented people working together. Look at anyone who's made it big in sports or business. If you do some digging, you'll see they all had help. Let's take Elon Musk as an example. Time: 05:44 - 06:13 On the surface, it might appear like he's a genius entrepreneur who's achieved everything single handedly. Time: 06:14 - 06:19 However, that couldn't be further from the truth. He was part of the group that launched PayPal. When eBay acquired PayPal for $1,500,000,000 Time: 06:20 - 06:28 in 02/2002, Time: 06:28 - 06:29 these newly wealthy tech experts spread across the industry like a virus. Now they're known as the PayPal mafia, as they have become such a powerful group. After leaving PayPal, they started many successful companies. Time: 06:29 - 06:42 These include big names like YouTube, Yelp, LinkedIn, and SpaceX. Time: 06:42 - 06:46 They often invest in each other's projects and give advice. But what if you're not aiming to launch the next billion dollar company and instead just wanna earn some extra money with a side hustle? Time: 06:47 - 06:57 Well, a lot of older business owners are kind of lost when it comes to everything tech based and using the Internet for their companies. I mean, a lot of them don't even know there's online tools for literally everything, Time: 06:57 - 07:08 whether it's managing your team, handling invoices, Time: 07:09 - 07:11 keeping track of projects, or even building a website. I don't blame them as back in the day, we didn't have any of these things, but now the younger generation has a real advantage. So if these older business owners don't know how to do a lot of this online stuff and they understand they can't do everything themselves, guess who they need? Time: 07:12 - 07:30 You. You can help them bring their businesses into the twenty first century and make a lot of money in the process. Time: 07:31 - 07:37 It's all well and good saying this, but how could you actually do it? Well, if you wanna give this a try, then I'd recommend using an all in one management platform. Odoo is a great choice as it includes the tools I just mentioned and more all in one place. Here's a great example of a website that needs a proper update. It looks like it was built over ten years ago. Let's jump on Odoo and make something a bit more up to date. So I'm gonna go over here and select the ecommerce app option. Time: 07:37 - 08:04 Now let's fill this in. I want a business website. There we go. Time: 08:04 - 08:08 And I want for my gardening business. After this, I've got the option to choose my color palette here, but instead, I'm just gonna add their logo so that Odoo just builds a palette based on their brand colors. Time: 08:09 - 08:21 Now we've got to pick a theme. All these look pretty good, so let's go with this one. I can use the drag and drop feature to easily edit the page and customize images. They also have this cool AI tool to help me out with words. Let's fast forward about thirty minutes, and I'll have something pretty cool to show you. Time: 08:21 - 08:39 Check this out. It's way better than the old website, in my opinion. You could make some serious cash helping out older business owners with all the different apps on Odoo or even use it to manage your own business. I reached out to Odoo to see if they wanted to sponsor this portion of the video. They agreed and are also giving you your first application free for life with unlimited support and hosting. And the cherry on top, Odoo offers a personalized domain name for one year. So if you wanna give this a try, then check out the link in the description. The fourth thing to avoid is having too many inputs. Do you ever feel like you're being pulled in a million different directions? Time: 08:42 - 09:18 This happens with everything in life, from side hustles to fitness training. Time: 09:18 - 09:22 Everyone seems to have a different opinion on what you should be focusing on. It can look a little bit like this. Time: 09:23 - 09:29 This is you, and these are the people telling you what they think you should be focusing on. For the sake of simplicity, Time: 09:30 - 09:37 let's just call them Time: 09:37 - 09:39 inputs. All these inputs create hundreds of paths you could follow, like becoming a doctor, Time: 09:39 - 09:45 entrepreneur, Time: 09:46 - 09:46 joining a family business, Time: 09:47 - 09:48 getting a stable nine to five job, Time: 09:49 - 09:51 traveling, Time: 09:52 - 09:52 and having a family. Let's call these your potential Time: 09:52 - 09:56 paths. The sheer number of these pathways can create something called cognitive Time: 09:57 - 10:01 overload, which is where your brain simply can't cope with the overwhelming amount of information and choices. So Time: 10:02 - 10:08 what's the solution? Well, I've always started with my end destination in mind and worked backwards. Of course, I didn't know exactly what I wanted to do in the future. However, I had a decent idea. Time: 10:09 - 10:21 I then made sure to only listen to inputs that help me reach those targets. The clearer your goal, the easier it becomes to select the right inputs to help you achieve it. So limit the number of opinions you receive and prioritize Time: 10:21 - 10:34 quality Time: 10:34 - 10:35 over quantity. Time: 10:35 - 10:36 Most people have too many opinions being thrown at them, but not from experts. Cut out general opinions and instead seek expert advice. This could come from a mentor, someone successful in your field, or even educational videos from experts like myself. Time: 10:37 - 10:51 By doing this, you'll get more valuable, focused, and specific guidance for your end goal. Remember, even when you work your way backwards, you still don't need to know everything at once. Fully listen and implement what you learn from an input. And then when you're facing another challenge, you can seek out more inputs that'll help you overcome it. If you don't do this, then you'll get mental fatigue, which can lead to decision paralysis, Time: 10:52 - 11:15 where you find yourself unable to take action or move forward. Time: 11:15 - 11:19 Some people might even mistake this for being lazy, but in reality, your brain just gets overwhelmed. The fifth thing to avoid is being ego driven. Let me start by saying this. Arrogant people won't even finish this video. They think they already know everything, so why bother sticking around? But that's exactly the problem. Arrogance blinds you to the opportunities Time: 11:20 - 11:41 that could genuinely change your life. Ego driven people are often too focused on the big picture, Time: 11:42 - 11:47 constantly dreaming of the end goal. This might sound productive, but it's a dangerous trap. When you're always looking too far ahead, you end up overlooking the small but crucial steps that lead to true success. For example, some might be tempted to scroll through this video just to see all seven things rather than sitting down and actually absorbing the knowledge in each one. But by doing so, they miss out on the valuable insights that could fast track their journey. When you're too egotistical, Time: 11:48 - 12:16 you start to believe that you don't need advice from others, especially those who might know more than you. You might dismiss the wisdom of people who have already walked the path that you're trying to take, but here's the truth. True wealth isn't just about being confident. It's about having the humility to keep learning, to understand that you don't know it all, and that's where the real growth happens. The more you learn, the more you realize how much you don't know. This is called the iceberg principle. Time: 12:17 - 12:44 What you know is just the tip of the iceberg. The massive chunk of knowledge is underneath the surface. That's what truly matters, and arrogance makes you forget that it's even there. In short, arrogance is a silent wealth killer. It convinces you that you're too good to learn, too smart to listen, and too important to take the small steps that lead to greatness. The sixth thing to avoid is passing the blame. One of my favorite Chinese proverbs is, the man who blames others has a long way on his journey to go. The man who blames himself is halfway there. The man who blames no one has already arrived. Time: 12:44 - 13:21 In front of me, I have two objects, a magnifying glass and a mirror. In life, you're gonna have to choose to reach for either of these on a daily basis. You might be thinking, Mark's gone mad, but let me explain. If you choose to pick up up the magnifying glass, it gives you the ability to hyperfocus on other people. Time: 13:21 - 13:40 This is a dangerous path as it leads to the blame game. Look. I do kinda get it. When anything goes wrong in life, it's natural to wanna pass the blame onto someone else, anyone but yourself. I'm sure there's been times when you've blamed your teacher for a test you failed, even though you spent more time binge watching Netflix than actually studying. Or maybe you pass the blame onto the traffic for being late, even though you left the house ten minutes later than you should have. But here's the thing. These small instances of blame don't stay small. Over time, they grow into a habit that's hard to break free from. Time: 13:40 - 14:15 I'm sure you've seen people say stuff like, the government hates young people. The system is rigged against people like me. My boss doesn't like me. I'm not rich enough to start a business, and life didn't give me the right opportunities. Time: 14:16 - 14:29 The more you reach for the magnifying glass, the bigger your excuses become. However, Time: 14:30 - 14:35 if you pick the mirror, then you instead focus on the stuff you can actually control, your own thoughts and actions. So to embody the wisdom of the Chinese proverb, Time: 14:35 - 14:44 to be the person who has already arrived at their destination, Time: 14:45 - 14:48 you need to pick up the mirror, not the magnifying glass. The seventh thing to avoid is staying static. Time: 14:48 - 14:54 This is your comfort zone where you retreat seeking safety and security. Time: 14:54 - 15:00 Notice how there are no gaps in this circle, Time: 15:00 - 15:03 almost like a self imposed prison with no way out and no way to grow. If you're currently here, then you're not alone. According to some studies, over half of Brits don't leave their comfort zone, and 45% Time: 15:03 - 15:16 of them are worried that one day they might regret it. So what can you do to break out of this prison? Time: 15:16 - 15:21 Well, you need to expand the circle. This could be really difficult when our minds are conditioned to avoid taking risks, but it's something I learned at an early age. Let me show you how I did it. When I was younger, my comfort zone was narrow, school, studying subjects I wasn't good at, like maths and English. The traditional education system didn't suit me. I didn't wanna be a banker, doctor, or lawyer. I wanted something more hands on. So I stepped out of my comfort zone and pursued the apprenticeship I mentioned earlier. This created a new space for me, but I wasn't satisfied yet. I knew I needed more from life, so I started experimenting with side hustles, which pushed me further into unfamiliar Time: 15:22 - 16:02 territory. Suddenly, the world was full of possibilities. Time: 16:03 - 16:06 The next step was clear, Time: 16:06 - 16:08 starting my own business. This was a pivotal moment requiring a big risk, a bank load. It was the best decision Time: 16:08 - 16:15 that I ever made. To expand my empire further, I traveled to China in search of a manufacturer for my own brand of radio control models. Despite the language and cultural barriers, I managed to build valuable Time: 16:16 - 16:28 connections. I ran my business for many years and enjoyed success, but, eventually, I felt complacent. My family was happy. My bank was happy, but my mind wasn't. I wanted more. So I expanded my comfort zone again and started posting videos on YouTube at the age of 53. Time: 16:29 - 16:46 I'd seen so many people on YouTube faking it, so I wanted to share my knowledge and help others who, like me, didn't fit the traditional path, or those who wanted to grow their wealth and feel more secure in life. Remember, you can expand your comfort zone as much as you want. This space is infinite, but you have to claim it for yourself. If you don't push beyond your current boundaries, you'll miss out on all the possibilities Time: 16:47 - 17:10 that could have been yours. If you wanna learn what to do every time you get paid, then I'll leave that video right up there. But don't click on it just yet. Make sure to subscribe if you wanna grow your wealth. Okay? I'll see you over there. Time: 17:10 - 17:22These are very valuable info for anybody who wants to get rich. Unfortunately, most people who will watch this video will not really be able to apply the knowledge embedded in it. We may not want to admit, but as Warren Buffett once said, investing is like any other profession-- it requires a certain level of expertise. No surprise that some people are losing a lot of money in the bear market, while others are making hundreds of thousands in profit. I just don't know how they do it. I've got $110k set aside to put in the market.",
