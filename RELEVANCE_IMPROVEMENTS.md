# 🎯 Relevance-Based Search Improvements

## What Changed

Based on user feedback about timeout issues and irrelevant results, we've **completely refocused** the title search to prioritize **keyword relevance over view count**.

---

## ❌ Old Approach (Niche Search - REMOVED)

**Problems:**
- ⏰ Timeout errors (60+ seconds)
- 🐌 Too slow (searching 30-60 channels)
- 😵 Complex and unreliable

**What we did:**
- ✅ **Hidden niche search toggle from UI**
- ✅ Now using **general YouTube search only**
- ✅ Focus on making general search **MUCH better**

---

## ✅ New Approach (Relevance-First)

### **Key Philosophy:**
**"Get the most RELEVANT titles, not just the most POPULAR titles"**

### **Changes Made:**

#### 1. **Sorting Algorithm** 🏆
```
BEFORE: Sort by (relevance_score, view_count)
        ↳ Popular videos came first even if less relevant

NOW:    Sort by relevance_score ONLY
        ↳ Most relevant titles come first, regardless of views
```

#### 2. **Improved Relevance Scoring** 🧮

**Multi-Strategy Scoring System:**

| Strategy | Match Type | Points |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| **Exact Phrase in Title** | "dividend stocks" in title | +100 pts |
| **Exact Phrase in Description** | "dividend stocks" in description | +20 pts |
| **Individual Words in Title** | "dividend" OR "stocks" in title | +10 pts each |
| **Essence Match** | AI-extracted core concept words | +15 pts each |

**Example:**
```
Topic: "How to invest in dividend stocks"

Video Title: "Best Dividend Stocks for Beginners 2024"
  - "dividend stocks" exact phrase in title → +100
  - "invest" from keywords → +10
  - "beginners" matches essence → +15
  ----------------------------------------
  TOTAL SCORE: 125 ✅ High relevance

Video Title: "Warren Buffett's Top Stock Picks"
  - "stock" word match → +10
  - No other matches
  ----------------------------------------
  TOTAL SCORE: 10 ⚠️ Lower relevance

Video Title: "How I Made $10,000 Last Month"
  - No keyword matches
  ----------------------------------------
  TOTAL SCORE: 0 ❌ Filtered out
```

#### 3. **Stricter Filtering** 🚫

**Minimum Relevance Threshold:**
- Videos with relevance_score < 10 are **automatically filtered out**
- This eliminates clickbait and off-topic videos

#### 4. **Search Optimization** ⚡

**Speed Improvements:**
```
BEFORE:
- 3 search queries × 20 results = 60 videos
- Searching niche channels (slow)
- Timeout: 60-120 seconds

NOW:
- 2 search queries × 20 results = 40 videos
- General YouTube search (fast)
- Timeout: 30 seconds
- Expected time: 5-10 seconds ✅
```

#### 5. **More Results** 📊

```
BEFORE: Top 20 results
NOW:    Top 30 results
```

More variety, better chance of finding perfect title!

## 🧪 How It Works Now

### **User Flow:**

1. **User enters topic:** "How to save money on taxes in India"

       "how to save money on taxes in india",
       "tax saving strategies indian taxpayers"
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **YouTube search (2 parallel queries):**
   - Query 1: "how to save money on taxes in india" → 20 videos
   - Query 2: "tax saving strategies indian taxpayers" → 20 videos
   - **Total: ~40 videos fetched**

4. **Filter for long-form:**

   - Uses YouTube API filter for efficiency

5. **Calculate relevance score:**
   - Each video scored using 3-strategy system
   - Videos < 10 relevance score filtered out
